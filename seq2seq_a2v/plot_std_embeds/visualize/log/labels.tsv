IF

WHO
SHE
WAS
IN

WITH
I
KNOW
WHO
HE
t_WAS
SIL
LET
ME
SAY
HERE
DISTINCTLY
TO
HAVE
DONE
WITH
IT
THAT
THIS
NARRATIVE
FROM
AN
EXACT
TRANSCRIPT
OF
MY
OWN
MADE
MUCH
LATER
IS
WHAT
I
SHALL
PRESENTLY
t_GIVE
SIL
POOR
DOUGLAS
BEFORE
HIS
DEATH
WHEN
IT
WAS
IN
SIGHT
COMMITTED
TO
ME
THE
MANUSCRIPT
THAT
REACHED
HIM
ON
THE
THIRD
OF
THESE
DAYS
AND
THAT
ON
THE
SAME
SPOT
WITH
IMMENSE
EFFECT
HE
BEGAN
TO
READ
TO
OUR
HUSHED
LITTLE
CIRCLE
ON
THE
NIGHT
OF
THE
t_FOURTH
SIL
THE
DEPARTING
LADIES
WHO
HAD
SAID
THEY
WOULD
STAY
DIDN'T
OF
COURSE
THANK
HEAVEN
STAY
THEY
DEPARTED
IN
CONSEQUENCE
OF
ARRANGEMENTS
MADE
IN
A
RAGE
OF
CURIOSITY
AS
THEY
PROFESSED
PRODUCED
BY
THE
TOUCHES
WITH
WHICH
HE
HAD
ALREADY
WORKED
US
t_UP
SIL
THE
FIRST
OF
THESE
TOUCHES
CONVEYED
THAT
THE
WRITTEN
STATEMENT
TOOK
UP
THE
TALE
AT
A
POINT
AFTER
IT
HAD
IN
A
MANNER
t_BEGUN
SIL
HE
HAD
FOR
HIS
OWN
TOWN
RESIDENCE
A
BIG
HOUSE
FILLED
WITH
THE
SPOILS
OF
TRAVEL
AND
THE
TROPHIES
OF
THE
CHASE
BUT
IT
WAS
TO
HIS
COUNTRY
HOME
AN
OLD
FAMILY
PLACE
IN
ESSEX
THAT
HE
WISHED
HER
IMMEDIATELY
TO
t_PROCEED
SIL
THE
AWKWARD
THING
WAS
THAT
THEY
HAD
PRACTICALLY
NO
OTHER
RELATIONS
AND
THAT
HIS
OWN
AFFAIRS
TOOK
UP
ALL
HIS
t_TIME
SIL
THERE
WERE
PLENTY
OF
PEOPLE
TO
HELP
BUT
OF
COURSE
THE
YOUNG
LADY
WHO
SHOULD
GO
DOWN
AS
GOVERNESS
WOULD
BE
IN
SUPREME
t_AUTHORITY
SIL
I
DON'T
t_ANTICIPATE
SIL
SHE
WAS
YOUNG
UNTRIED
NERVOUS
IT
WAS
A
VISION
OF
SERIOUS
DUTIES
AND
LITTLE
COMPANY
OF
REALLY
GREAT
t_LONELINESS
SIL
YES
BUT
THAT'S
JUST
THE
BEAUTY
OF
HER
t_PASSION
SIL
IT
WAS
THE
BEAUTY
OF
t_IT
SIL
IT
SOUNDED
DULL
IT
SOUNDED
STRANGE
AND
ALL
THE
MORE
SO
BECAUSE
OF
HIS
MAIN
CONDITION
WHICH
t_WAS
SIL
SHE
PROMISED
TO
DO
THIS
AND
SHE
MENTIONED
TO
ME
THAT
WHEN
FOR
A
MOMENT
DISBURDENED
DELIGHTED
HE
HELD
HER
HAND
THANKING
HER
FOR
THE
SACRIFICE
SHE
ALREADY
FELT
t_REWARDED
SIL
BUT
WAS
THAT
ALL
HER
REWARD
ONE
OF
THE
LADIES
t_ASKED
SIL
HERE
SHE
WOULD
STAY
COMFORTED
AND
SOOTHED
AMONG
THE
LOVELY
PLANTS
AND
RICH
EXOTICS
REJOICING
THE
HEART
OF

THE

SINCE

FIRST
RAPTUROUS

TAKEN
HER
INTO
HIS
GOOD
GRACES
FOR
ALL

EVERY
CHANCE

STEAL
AFTER

SOMEHOW
OF
ALL
THE

WHEN
THE

FEELING

THE
STRONGEST
THIS

IT
SEEMED

THE

TOGETHER
HE
THREW
OUT
HIS

ART
CAN
ONLY
RATIFY
THEIR
OPINION
THAT
THE
BEAUTY
OF
A
COCK
ROBIN
IS
TO
BE
RED
AND
OF
A
GRASS
PLOT
TO
BE
GREEN
AND
THE
BEST
SKILL
OF
ART
IS
IN
INSTANTLY
SEIZING
ON
THE
MANIFOLD
DELICIOUSNESS
OF
LIGHT
WHICH
YOU
CAN
ONLY
SEIZE
BY
PRECISION
OF
INSTANTANEOUS
t_TOUCH
SIL
NOW
YOU
WILL
SEE
IN
THESE
STUDIES
THAT
THE
MOMENT
THE
WHITE
IS
INCLOSED
PROPERLY
AND
HARMONIZED
WITH
THE
OTHER
HUES
IT
BECOMES
SOMEHOW
MORE
PRECIOUS
AND
PEARLY
THAN
THE
WHITE
PAPER
AND
THAT
I
AM
NOT
AFRAID
TO
LEAVE
A
WHOLE
FIELD
OF
UNTREATED
WHITE
PAPER
ALL
ROUND
IT
BEING
SURE
THAT
EVEN
THE
LITTLE
DIAMONDS
IN
THE
ROUND

WILL
TELL
AS
JEWELS
IF
THEY
ARE
GRADATED
t_JUSTLY
SIL
BUT
IN
THIS
VIGNETTE
COPIED
FROM
TURNER
YOU
HAVE
THE
TWO
PRINCIPLES
BROUGHT
OUT
t_PERFECTLY
SIL
THEY
ARE
BEYOND
ALL
OTHER
WORKS
THAT
I
KNOW
EXISTING
DEPENDENT
FOR
THEIR
EFFECT
ON
LOW
SUBDUED
TONES
THEIR
FAVORITE
CHOICE
IN

OF

BEING
EITHER
DAWN
OR
TWILIGHT
AND
EVEN
THEIR
BRIGHTEST

CHIEFLY
OUT
OF

IT
MAY
BE
THAT
A
GREAT
COLORIST
WILL
USE
HIS
UTMOST
FORCE
OF

AS
A
SINGER
HIS
FULL
POWER
OF

BUT
LOUD
OR
LOW
THE
VIRTUE
IS
IN
BOTH
CASES
ALWAYS
IN
REFINEMENT
NEVER
IN
t_LOUDNESS
SIL
IT
MUST
REMEMBER
BE
ONE
OR
THE
t_OTHER
SIL
DO
NOT
THEREFORE
THINK
THAT
THE
GOTHIC
SCHOOL
IS
AN
EASY
t_ONE
SIL
THE
LAW
OF
THAT
SCHOOL
IS
THAT
EVERYTHING
SHALL
BE
SEEN
CLEARLY
OR
AT
LEAST
ONLY
IN
SUCH
MIST
OR
FAINTNESS
AS
SHALL
BE
DELIGHTFUL
AND
I
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
THAT
THE
BEST
INTRODUCTION
TO
IT
WOULD
BE
THE
ELEMENTARY
PRACTICE
OF
PAINTING
EVERY
STUDY
ON
A
GOLDEN
t_GROUND
SIL
THIS
AT
ONCE
COMPELS
YOU
TO
UNDERSTAND
THAT
THE
WORK
IS
TO
BE
IMAGINATIVE
AND
DECORATIVE
THAT
IT
REPRESENTS
BEAUTIFUL
THINGS
IN
THE
CLEAREST
WAY
BUT
NOT
UNDER
EXISTING
CONDITIONS
AND
THAT
IN
FACT
YOU
ARE
PRODUCING
JEWELER'S
WORK
RATHER
THAN
t_PICTURES
SIL
THAT
A
STYLE
IS
RESTRAINED
OR
SEVERE
DOES
NOT
MEAN
THAT
IT
IS
ALSO
t_ERRONEOUS
SIL
IN
ALL
EARLY
GOTHIC
ART
INDEED
YOU
WILL
FIND
FAILURE
OF
THIS
KIND
ESPECIALLY
DISTORTION
AND
RIGIDITY
WHICH
ARE
IN
MANY
RESPECTS
PAINFULLY
TO
BE
COMPARED
WITH
THE
SPLENDID
REPOSE
OF
CLASSIC
t_ART
SIL
THE
LARGE
LETTER
CONTAINS
INDEED
ENTIRELY
FEEBLE
AND
ILL
DRAWN

THAT
IS
MERELY
CHILDISH
AND
FAILING
WORK
OF
AN
INFERIOR
HAND
IT
IS
NOT
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
GOTHIC
OR
ANY
OTHER
t_SCHOOL
SIL
BUT
OBSERVE
YOU
CAN
ONLY
DO
THIS
ON
ONE
CONDITION
THAT
OF
STRIVING
ALSO
TO
CREATE
IN
REALITY
THE
BEAUTY
WHICH
YOU
SEEK
IN
t_IMAGINATION
SIL
IT
WILL
BE
WHOLLY
IMPOSSIBLE
FOR
YOU
TO
RETAIN
THE
TRANQUILLITY
OF

AND
FELICITY
OF

NECESSARY
FOR

UNLESS
YOU
ARE
ACTIVELY
ENGAGED
IN
PROMOTING
THE
FELICITY
AND

OF

t_LIFE

YOU
MUST
LOOK
AT

IN

FIGHT
HIM
CONQUER
HIM
WITH
WHAT
SCATHE
YOU
MAY
YOU
NEED
NOT
THINK
TO
KEEP
OUT
OF
THE

OF
t_HIM

THE

SAYS
FIRST
OF
ALL
AS
MY
DELICIOUS
PAROQUET
WAS
RUBY
SO
THIS
NASTY

BE
BLACK
AND
THEN
IS
THE
QUESTION
CAN
I
ROUND
HIM
OFF
EVEN
THOUGH
HE
IS
BLACK
AND
MAKE
HIM
SLIMY
AND

SPRINGY
AND
CLOSE
DOWN

NOTHING

AT

NO

NO

IN

THE

OVER
THE

HUNG
FOUR

ALL
BUBBLING
AND

AT

IT
TAKES

SEVERAL
YEARS
TO

MAGIC
POWDER
BUT
AT

MOMENT
I
AM
PLEASED
TO
SAY
IT
IS
NEARLY
DONE
YOU
SEE
I
AM
MAKING
IT
FOR
MY

WHO
WANTS
TO

FOR

WHEN

MY

FOOLISHLY
GAVE
AWAY
ALL
THE

TO
THE

THE
FIRST
LOT
WE
TESTED
ON
OUR
GLASS
CAT
WHICH
NOT
ONLY
BEGAN
TO
LIVE
BUT
HAS
LIVED
EVER
t_SINCE
SIL
I
THINK
THE
NEXT
GLASS
CAT
THE
MAGICIAN
MAKES
WILL
HAVE
NEITHER
BRAINS
NOR
HEART
FOR
THEN
IT
WILL
NOT
OBJECT
TO

AND
MAY
PROVE
OF
SOME

TO
t_US

I'M
AFRAID
I
DON'T
KNOW
MUCH
ABOUT
THE
LAND
OF

SIL
YOU
SEE
I'VE
LIVED
ALL
MY
LIFE
WITH
UNC
<UNK>
THE
SILENT
ONE
AND
THERE
WAS
NO
ONE
TO
TELL
ME
t_ANYTHING
SIL
THAT
IS
ONE
REASON
YOU
ARE
OJO
THE
UNLUCKY
SAID
THE
WOMAN
IN
A
SYMPATHETIC
t_TONE
SIL
I
THINK
I
MUST
SHOW
YOU
MY
PATCHWORK
GIRL
SAID
<UNK>
LAUGHING
AT
THE
BOY'S
ASTONISHMENT
FOR
SHE
IS
RATHER
DIFFICULT
TO
t_EXPLAIN
SIL
BUT
FIRST
I
WILL
TELL
YOU
THAT
FOR
MANY
YEARS
I
HAVE
LONGED
FOR
A
SERVANT
TO
HELP
ME
WITH
THE
HOUSEWORK
AND
TO
COOK
THE
MEALS
AND
WASH
THE
t_DISHES
SIL
YET
THAT
TASK
WAS
NOT
SO
EASY
AS
YOU
MAY
t_SUPPOSE
SIL
A
BED
QUILT
MADE
OF
PATCHES
OF
DIFFERENT
KINDS
AND
COLORS
OF
CLOTH
ALL
NEATLY
SEWED
t_TOGETHER
SIL
SOMETIMES
IT
IS
CALLED
A
CRAZY
QUILT
BECAUSE
THE
PATCHES
AND
COLORS
ARE
SO
MIXED
t_UP
SIL
WHEN
I
FOUND
IT
I
SAID
TO
MYSELF
THAT
IT
WOULD
DO
NICELY
FOR
MY
SERVANT
GIRL
FOR
WHEN
SHE
WAS
BROUGHT
TO
LIFE
SHE
WOULD
NOT
BE
PROUD
NOR
HAUGHTY
AS
THE
GLASS
CAT
IS
FOR
SUCH
A
DREADFUL
MIXTURE
OF
COLORS
WOULD
DISCOURAGE
HER
FROM
TRYING
TO
BE
AS
DIGNIFIED
AS
THE
BLUE
MUNCHKINS
t_ARE
SIL
AT
THE
EMERALD
CITY
WHERE
OUR
PRINCESS
OZMA
LIVES
GREEN
IS
THE
POPULAR
t_COLOR
SIL
I
WILL
SHOW
YOU
WHAT
A
GOOD
JOB
I
DID
AND
SHE
WENT
TO
A
TALL
CUPBOARD
AND
THREW
OPEN
THE
t_DOORS
SIL
OJO
EXAMINED
THIS
CURIOUS
CONTRIVANCE
WITH
t_WONDER
SIL
<UNK>
HAD
FIRST
MADE
THE
GIRL'S
FORM
FROM
THE
PATCHWORK
QUILT
AND
THEN
SHE
HAD
DRESSED
IT
WITH
A
PATCHWORK
SKIRT
AND
AN
APRON
WITH
POCKETS
IN
IT
USING
THE
SAME
GAY
MATERIAL
t_THROUGHOUT
SIL
THE
HEAD
OF
THE
PATCHWORK
GIRL
WAS
THE
MOST
CURIOUS
PART
OF
t_HER
SIL
THE
HAIR
WAS
OF
BROWN
YARN
AND
HUNG
DOWN
ON
HER
NECK
IN
SEVERAL
NEAT
t_BRAIDS
SIL
GOLD
IS
THE
MOST
COMMON
METAL
IN
THE
LAND
OF
OZ
AND
IS
USED
FOR
MANY
PURPOSES
BECAUSE
IT
IS
SOFT
AND
t_PLIABLE
SIL
NO
I
FORGOT
ALL
ABOUT
THE
BRAINS
EXCLAIMED
THE
t_WOMAN
SIL
WELL
THAT
MAY
BE
TRUE
AGREED
<UNK>
BUT
ON
THE
CONTRARY
A
SERVANT
WITH
TOO
MUCH
BRAINS
IS
SURE
TO
BECOME
INDEPENDENT
AND
HIGH
AND
MIGHTY
AND
FEEL
ABOVE
HER
t_WORK
SIL
SHE
POURED
INTO
THE
DISH
A
QUANTITY
FROM
EACH
OF
THESE
t_BOTTLES
SIL
I
THINK
THAT
WILL
DO
SHE
CONTINUED
FOR
THE
OTHER
QUALITIES
ARE
NOT
NEEDED
IN
A
t_SERVANT
SIL
SHE
RAN
TO
HER
HUSBAND'S
SIDE
AT
ONCE
AND
HELPED
HIM
LIFT
THE
FOUR
KETTLES
FROM
THE
t_FIRE
SIL
THEIR
CONTENTS
HAD
ALL
BOILED
AWAY
LEAVING
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
EACH
KETTLE
A
FEW
GRAINS
OF
FINE
WHITE
t_POWDER
SIL
VERY
CAREFULLY
THE
MAGICIAN
REMOVED
THIS
POWDER
PLACING
IT
ALL
TOGETHER
IN
A
GOLDEN
DISH
WHERE
HE
MIXED
IT
WITH
A
GOLDEN
t_SPOON
SIL
NO
ONE
SAW
HIM
DO
THIS
FOR
ALL
WERE
LOOKING
AT
THE
POWDER
OF
LIFE
BUT
SOON
THE
WOMAN
REMEMBERED
WHAT
SHE
HAD
BEEN
DOING
AND
CAME
BACK
TO
THE
t_CUPBOARD
SIL
OJO
BECAME
A
BIT
UNEASY
AT
THIS
FOR
HE
HAD
ALREADY
PUT
QUITE
A
LOT
OF
THE
CLEVERNESS
POWDER
IN
THE
DISH
BUT
HE
DARED
NOT
INTERFERE
AND
SO
HE
COMFORTED
HIMSELF
WITH
THE
THOUGHT
THAT
ONE
CANNOT
HAVE
TOO
MUCH
t_CLEVERNESS
SIL
HE
SELECTED
A
SMALL
GOLD
BOTTLE
WITH
A
PEPPER
BOX
TOP
SO
THAT
THE
POWDER
MIGHT
BE
SPRINKLED
ON
ANY
OBJECT
THROUGH
THE
SMALL
t_HOLES
SIL
MOST
PEOPLE
TALK
TOO
MUCH
SO
IT
IS
A
RELIEF
TO
FIND
ONE
WHO
TALKS
TOO
t_LITTLE
SIL
I
AM
NOT
ALLOWED
TO
PERFORM
MAGIC
EXCEPT
FOR
MY
OWN
AMUSEMENT
HE
TOLD
HIS
VISITORS
AS
HE
LIGHTED
A
PIPE
WITH
A
CROOKED
STEM
AND
BEGAN
TO
t_SMOKE
SIL
THE
WIZARD
OF
OZ
WHO
USED
TO
BE
A
HUMBUG
AND
KNEW
NO
MAGIC
AT
ALL
HAS
BEEN
TAKING
LESSONS
OF
GLINDA
AND
I'M
TOLD
HE
IS
GETTING
TO
BE
A
PRETTY
GOOD
WIZARD
BUT
HE
IS
MERELY
THE
ASSISTANT
OF
THE
GREAT
t_SORCERESS

IT
TRULY
IS
ASSERTED
THE
t_MAGICIAN

I
NOW
USE
THEM
AS

STATUARY
IN

THE

ASKED
THE

IN
SCORNFUL

THE
GRATEFUL
APPLAUSE

CONSECRATED
THE

A

INDULGED
THEIR

AND
PROMOTED

THE

THE
PRIVILEGE

THE

WERE
GUILTY
OF

MIGHT
SAVE
THOSE

FROM
THE
DANGER
OF
AN
EVERLASTING

SOME
OF
THE

WERE
COPIED
FROM
THE

OF

THIS
METHOD
OF

WAS
APPLAUDED

OF
WEAKNESS
IN
AN
ENEMY
SO
LONG
HATED
AND
SO
MUCH
t_FEARED
SIL
THEY
DREW
BACK
A
LITTLE
FROM
THE
ENTRANCE
AND
MOTIONED
TO
THE
SUPPOSED
CONJURER
TO
t_ENTER
SIL
BUT
THE
BEAR
INSTEAD
OF
OBEYING
MAINTAINED
THE
SEAT
IT
HAD
TAKEN
AND
t_GROWLED
SIL
THE
CUNNING
MAN
IS
AFRAID
THAT
HIS
BREATH
WILL
BLOW
UPON
HIS
BROTHERS
AND
TAKE
AWAY
THEIR
COURAGE
TOO
CONTINUED
DAVID
IMPROVING
THE
HINT
HE
RECEIVED
THEY
MUST
STAND
FURTHER
t_OFF
SIL
THEN
AS
IF
SATISFIED
OF
THEIR
SAFETY
THE
SCOUT
LEFT
HIS
POSITION
AND
SLOWLY
ENTERED
THE
t_PLACE
SIL
IT
WAS
SILENT
AND
GLOOMY
BEING
TENANTED
SOLELY
BY
THE
CAPTIVE
AND
LIGHTED
BY
THE
DYING
EMBERS
OF
A
FIRE
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
USED
FOR
THE
PURPOSED
OF
t_COOKERY
SIL
UNCAS
OCCUPIED
A
DISTANT
CORNER
IN
A
RECLINING
ATTITUDE
BEING
RIGIDLY
BOUND
BOTH
HANDS
AND
FEET
BY
STRONG
AND
PAINFUL
t_WITHES
SIL
THE
SCOUT
WHO
HAD
LEFT
DAVID
AT
THE
DOOR
TO
ASCERTAIN
THEY
WERE
NOT
OBSERVED
THOUGHT
IT
PRUDENT
TO
PRESERVE
HIS
DISGUISE
UNTIL
ASSURED
OF
THEIR
t_PRIVACY
SIL
WHAT
SHALL
WE
DO
WITH
THE
MINGOES
AT
THE
DOOR
THEY
COUNT
SIX
AND
THIS
SINGER
IS
AS
GOOD
AS
t_NOTHING
SIL
THE
DELAWARES
ARE
CHILDREN
OF
THE
TORTOISE
AND
THEY
OUTSTRIP
THE
t_DEER
SIL
UNCAS
WHO
HAD
ALREADY
APPROACHED
THE
DOOR
IN
READINESS
TO
LEAD
THE
WAY
NOW
RECOILED
AND
PLACED
HIMSELF
ONCE
MORE
IN
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
t_LODGE
SIL
BUT
HAWKEYE
WHO
WAS
TOO
MUCH
OCCUPIED
WITH
HIS
OWN
THOUGHTS
TO
NOTE
THE
MOVEMENT
CONTINUED
SPEAKING
MORE
TO
HIMSELF
THAN
TO
HIS
t_COMPANION
SIL
SO
UNCAS
YOU
HAD
BETTER
TAKE
THE
LEAD
WHILE
I
WILL
PUT
ON
THE
SKIN
AGAIN
AND
TRUST
TO
CUNNING
FOR
WANT
OF
t_SPEED
SIL
WELL
WHAT
CAN'T
BE
DONE
BY
MAIN
COURAGE
IN
WAR
MUST
BE
DONE
BY
t_CIRCUMVENTION
SIL
AS
SOON
AS
THESE
DISPOSITIONS
WERE
MADE
THE
SCOUT
TURNED
TO
DAVID
AND
GAVE
HIM
HIS
PARTING
t_INSTRUCTIONS
SIL
MY
PURSUITS
ARE
PEACEFUL
AND
MY
TEMPER
I
HUMBLY
TRUST
IS
GREATLY
GIVEN
TO
MERCY
AND
LOVE
RETURNED
DAVID
A
LITTLE
NETTLED
AT
SO
DIRECT
AN
ATTACK
ON
HIS
MANHOOD
BUT
THERE
ARE
NONE
WHO
CAN
SAY
THAT
I
HAVE
EVER
FORGOTTEN
MY
FAITH
IN
THE
LORD
EVEN
IN
THE
GREATEST
t_STRAITS
SIL
IF
YOU
ARE
NOT
THEN
KNOCKED
ON
THE
HEAD
YOUR
BEING
A
NON
<UNK>
WILL
PROTECT
YOU
AND
YOU'LL
THEN
HAVE
A
GOOD
REASON
TO
EXPECT
TO
DIE
IN
YOUR
t_BED
SIL
SO
CHOOSE
FOR
YOURSELF
TO
MAKE
A
RUSH
OR
TARRY
t_HERE
SIL
BRAVELY
AND
GENEROUSLY
HAS
HE
BATTLED
IN
MY
BEHALF
AND
THIS
AND
MORE
WILL
I
DARE
IN
HIS
t_SERVICE
SIL
KEEP
SILENT
AS
LONG
AS
MAY
BE
AND
IT
WOULD
BE
WISE
WHEN
YOU
DO
SPEAK
TO
BREAK
OUT
SUDDENLY
IN
ONE
OF
YOUR
SHOUTINGS
WHICH
WILL
SERVE
TO
REMIND
THE
INDIANS
THAT
YOU
ARE
NOT
ALTOGETHER
AS
RESPONSIBLE
AS
MEN
SHOULD
t_BE
SIL
IF
HOWEVER
THEY
TAKE
YOUR
SCALP
AS
I
TRUST
AND
BELIEVE
THEY
WILL
NOT
DEPEND
ON
IT
UNCAS
AND
I
WILL
NOT
FORGET
THE
DEED
BUT
REVENGE
IT
AS
BECOMES
TRUE
WARRIORS
AND
TRUSTY
t_FRIENDS
SIL
HOLD
SAID
DAVID
PERCEIVING
THAT
WITH
THIS
ASSURANCE
THEY
WERE
ABOUT
TO
LEAVE
HIM
I
AM
AN
UNWORTHY
AND
HUMBLE
FOLLOWER
OF
ONE
WHO
TAUGHT
NOT
THE
DAMNABLE
PRINCIPLE
OF
t_REVENGE
SIL
THEN
HEAVING
A
HEAVY
SIGH
PROBABLY
AMONG
THE
LAST
HE
EVER
DREW
IN
PINING
FOR
A
CONDITION
HE
HAD
SO
LONG
ABANDONED
HE
ADDED
IT
IS
WHAT
I
WOULD
WISH
TO
PRACTISE
MYSELF
AS
ONE
WITHOUT
A
CROSS
OF
BLOOD
THOUGH
IT
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
EASY
TO
DEAL
WITH
AN
INDIAN
AS
YOU
WOULD
WITH
A
FELLOW
t_CHRISTIAN
SIL
GOD
BLESS
YOU
FRIEND
I
DO
BELIEVE
YOUR
SCENT
IS
NOT
GREATLY
WRONG
WHEN
THE
MATTER
IS
DULY
CONSIDERED
AND
KEEPING
ETERNITY
BEFORE
THE
EYES
THOUGH
MUCH
DEPENDS
ON
THE
NATURAL
GIFTS
AND
THE
FORCE
OF
t_TEMPTATION
SIL
THE
DELAWARE

HE
SAID
LEANING
FORWARD
AND
PEERING
THROUGH
THE
DIM
LIGHT
TO

THE
EXPRESSION
OF
THE
OTHER'S

IS
HE
t_AFRAID
SIL
WILL
THE

HEAR
HIS
t_GROANS
SIL
THE
MOHICAN
STARTED
ON
HIS

AND
SHOOK
HIS
SHAGGY
COVERING
AS
THOUGH
THE
ANIMAL
HE
COUNTERFEITED
WAS
ABOUT
TO
MAKE
SOME
DESPERATE
t_EFFORT
SIL
HE
HAD
NO
OCCASION
TO
DELAY
FOR
AT
THE
NEXT
INSTANT
A
BURST
OF
CRIES
FILLED
THE

AIR
AND
RAN
ALONG
THE

EXTENT
OF
THE
t_VILLAGE
SIL
UNCAS
CAST
HIS

AND

FORTH
IN
HIS
OWN
BEAUTIFUL
t_PROPORTIONS
SIL
I
WILL
ENDEAVOUR
IN
MY
STATEMENT
TO
AVOID
SUCH

AS
WOULD
SERVE
TO
LIMIT
THE
EVENTS
TO
ANY
PARTICULAR
PLACE
OR
GIVE
A
CLUE
AS
TO
THE
PEOPLE
t_CONCERNED
SIL
I
HAD
ALWAYS
KNOWN
HIM
TO
BE
RESTLESS
IN
HIS
MANNER
BUT
ON
THIS
PARTICULAR
OCCASION
HE
WAS
IN
SUCH
A
STATE
OF
UNCONTROLLABLE
AGITATION
THAT
IT
WAS
CLEAR
SOMETHING
VERY
UNUSUAL
HAD
t_OCCURRED
SIL
MY
FRIEND'S
TEMPER
HAD
NOT
IMPROVED
SINCE
HE
HAD
BEEN
DEPRIVED
OF
THE
CONGENIAL
SURROUNDINGS
OF
BAKER
t_STREET
SIL
WITHOUT
HIS
SCRAPBOOKS
HIS
CHEMICALS
AND
HIS
HOMELY
UNTIDINESS
HE
WAS
AN
UNCOMFORTABLE
t_MAN
SIL
I
HAD
TO
READ
IT
OVER
CAREFULLY
AS
THE
TEXT
MUST
BE
ABSOLUTELY
t_CORRECT
SIL
I
WAS
ABSENT
RATHER
MORE
THAN
AN
t_HOUR
SIL
THE
ONLY
DUPLICATE
WHICH
EXISTED
SO
FAR
AS
I
KNEW
WAS
THAT
WHICH
BELONGED
TO
MY
SERVANT
BANNISTER
A
MAN
WHO
HAS
LOOKED
AFTER
MY
ROOM
FOR
TEN
YEARS
AND
WHOSE
HONESTY
IS
ABSOLUTELY
ABOVE
t_SUSPICION
SIL
THE
MOMENT
I
LOOKED
AT
MY
TABLE
I
WAS
AWARE
THAT
SOMEONE
HAD
RUMMAGED
AMONG
MY
t_PAPERS
SIL
THE
PROOF
WAS
IN
THREE
LONG
SLIPS
I
HAD
LEFT
THEM
ALL
t_TOGETHER
SIL
THE
ALTERNATIVE
WAS
THAT
SOMEONE
PASSING
HAD
OBSERVED
THE
KEY
IN
THE
DOOR
HAD
KNOWN
THAT
I
WAS
OUT
AND
HAD
ENTERED
TO
LOOK
AT
THE
t_PAPERS
SIL
I
GAVE
HIM
A
LITTLE
BRANDY
AND
LEFT
HIM
COLLAPSED
IN
A
CHAIR
WHILE
I
MADE
A
MOST
CAREFUL
EXAMINATION
OF
THE
t_ROOM
SIL
A
BROKEN
TIP
OF
LEAD
WAS
LYING
THERE
t_ALSO
SIL
NOT
ONLY
THIS
BUT
ON
THE
TABLE
I
FOUND
A
SMALL
BALL
OF
BLACK
DOUGH
OR
CLAY
WITH
SPECKS
OF
SOMETHING
WHICH
LOOKS
LIKE

IN
t_IT
SIL
ABOVE
ALL
THINGS
I
DESIRE
TO
SETTLE
THE
MATTER
QUIETLY
AND
t_DISCREETLY
SIL
TO
THE
BEST
OF
MY
BELIEF
THEY
WERE
ROLLED
t_UP
SIL
DID
ANYONE
KNOW
THAT
THESE

WOULD
BE
THERE
NO
ONE
SAVE
THE
t_PRINTER
SIL
I
WAS
IN
SUCH
A
HURRY
TO
COME
TO
YOU
YOU
LEFT
YOUR

t_OPEN
SIL
SO
IT
SEEMS
TO
t_ME
SIL
NOW
MISTER
SOAMES
AT
YOUR
t_DISPOSAL
SIL
ABOVE
WERE
THREE
STUDENTS
ONE
ON
EACH
t_STORY
SIL
THEN
HE
APPROACHED
IT
AND
STANDING
ON
TIPTOE
WITH
HIS
NECK
CRANED
HE
LOOKED
INTO
THE
t_ROOM
SIL
THERE
IS
NO
OPENING
EXCEPT
THE
ONE
PANE
SAID
OUR
LEARNED
t_GUIDE
SIL
I
AM
AFRAID
THERE

NO

t_HE
SIL

COULD
HARDLY
HOPE
FOR
ANY
UPON
SO
DRY
A
t_DAY
SIL
YOU
LEFT
HIM
IN
A
CHAIR
YOU
SAY
WHICH
CHAIR
BY
THE
WINDOW
t_THERE
SIL
THE
MAN
ENTERED
AND
TOOK
THE

SHEET
BY
SHEET
FROM
THE
CENTRAL
t_TABLE
SIL
AS
A
MATTER
OF

HE
COULD
NOT

ENTERED
BY

HOW
LONG
WOULD
IT
TAKE
HIM
TO
DO
THAT
USING
EVERY
POSSIBLE
CONTRACTION
A
QUARTER
OF
AN
HOUR
NOT
t_LESS
SIL
THEN
HE
TOSSED
IT
DOWN
AND
SEIZED
THE
t_NEXT
SIL
HE
WAS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
THAT
WHEN
YOUR
RETURN
CAUSED
HIM
TO
MAKE
A
VERY
HURRIED
RETREAT
VERY
HURRIED
SINCE
HE
HAD
NOT
TIME
TO

THE

WHICH
WOULD
TELL
YOU
THAT

BEEN
t_THERE
SIL
MISTER

I
HAVE
ALWAYS

I
WAS

THAT
IF
THE

ON

HE
WROTE

THIN
SOME

OF

MIGHT
COME
THROUGH
UPON
THIS
POLISHED

NO
I

AS
HOLMES
DREW
THE

I
WAS
AWARE
FROM
SOME
LITTLE
RIGIDITY
AND

OF
HIS
ATTITUDE
THAT
HE
WAS

FOR
AN
t_EMERGENCY
SIL
HOLMES
TURNED
AWAY

SUDDENLY

HALLOA
WHAT'S
t_THIS

HE
CAUGHT

EVERYTHING

BETRAY
HIM
AND
HE
RUSHED
INTO
YOUR

TO
CONCEAL
t_HIMSELF
SIL
I
UNDERSTAND
YOU
TO
SAY
THAT
THERE
ARE
THREE

LET

I
WILL

AFTER
THE
t_PROOFS
SIL
MY

IS
HARD

THE

BELONGS
TO
MILES

t_LAREN
SIL
I
DARE
NOT

SO

AS
THAT
BUT
OF
THE
THREE
HE
IS
PERHAPS
THE

t_UNLIKELY
SIL
HE
WAS
STILL
SUFFERING
FROM
THIS
SUDDEN
DISTURBANCE
OF
THE
QUIET
ROUTINE
OF
HIS

SIL
BUT
I
HAVE
OCCASIONALLY
DONE
THE

AT

DID
YOU

ON
THE
t_TABLE
SIL
HOW
CAME
YOU
TO
LEAVE
THE

IN

SIL
ANYONE
IN

I
REALLY
DON'T

SUDDENLY
UPON
HIS

HE
WAS
PACING
SWIFTLY
UP
AND
DOWN
HIS

SIL
THIS
SET
OF

NOT
UNUSUAL
FOR

SIL
NO

SAID
HOLMES
AS
WE
KNOCKED
AT

t_DOOR
SIL
OF

HE
DID
NOT
REALIZE
THAT
IT
WAS
I
WHO
WAS
KNOCKING
BUT
NONE
THE

HIS
CONDUCT
WAS
VERY
UNCOURTEOUS
AND
INDEED
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
RATHER
t_SUSPICIOUS

THAT
IS
VERY
IMPORTANT
SAID
t_HOLMES
SIL
YOU
DON'T

TO

THE
t_POSITION
SIL
TO

IS
THE
t_EXAMINATION
SIL
I
CANNOT

IF

IT
IS

THE
FOUL
MOUTHED

AT

HE
IS
THE

WITH
THE

MY

AND
ONE

THIS
t_MORNING

IN

THE

WAS

ALLOWING

TO
COMPETE
FOR
THE
VALUABLE

SIL
HE
COULD
HARDLY
STAND

OUTSTRETCHED
THANK

THAT
YOU
HAVE
t_COME
SIL
YOU
KNOW
HIM
I
THINK
t_SO
SIL
IF
THIS

IS
NOT
TO

AND
RESOLVE
OURSELVES

CAME
DOWN
TO

AMONG

I

BY

WHEN

YOU
MAY
BE

CONFIRMS

ASCRIBES

HOW

THE

WHO
IS

AND
THE
SON
OF

GAVE
HIMSELF
FOR
OUR
t_SINS

SINCE

WAS
GIVEN
FOR

IT
STANDS
TO
REASON
THAT
THEY
CANNOT
BE
PUT
AWAY
BY
OUR

t_EFFORTS
SIL
THIS
SENTENCE
ALSO
DEFINES
OUR
SINS
AS
GREAT
SO
GREAT
IN

THAT
THE

COULD
NOT
MAKE
AMENDS
FOR
A
SINGLE
t_SIN

THE

OF
THE

THE

t_THIS

THE
VICIOUS
CHARACTER
OF

IS
BROUGHT
OUT
BY

WHO
GAVE
HIMSELF
FOR
OUR
t_SINS

BUT
WE
ARE
CARELESS
WE
MAKE
LIGHT
OF
t_SIN
SIL
WE
THINK
THAT
BY
SOME
LITTLE
WORK
OR
MERIT
WE
CAN
DISMISS
t_SIN
SIL
THIS
PASSAGE
THEN
BEARS
OUT
THE
FACT
THAT
ALL
MEN
ARE
SOLD
UNDER
t_SIN
SIL
THIS
ATTITUDE
SPRINGS
FROM
A
FALSE
CONCEPTION
OF
SIN
THE
CONCEPTION
THAT
SIN
IS
A
SMALL
MATTER
EASILY
TAKEN
CARE
OF
BY
GOOD
WORKS
THAT
WE
MUST
PRESENT
OURSELVES
UNTO
GOD
WITH
A
GOOD
CONSCIENCE
THAT
WE
MUST
FEEL
NO
SIN
BEFORE
WE
MAY
FEEL
THAT
CHRIST
WAS
GIVEN
FOR

t_SINS
SIL
THIS
ATTITUDE
IS
UNIVERSAL
AND
PARTICULARLY
DEVELOPED
IN
THOSE
WHO
CONSIDER
THEMSELVES
BETTER
THAN
t_OTHERS
SIL
BUT
THE
REAL
SIGNIFICANCE
AND
COMFORT
OF
THE

FOR

IS
LOST
UPON
t_THEM

THE

EXERCISED
UPON

IS
DUE
PARTLY
TO
A
t_MISUNDERSTANDING

IN
THE

WAS
TRULY
GREAT

IN

HIS

AT

THERE
IS
NO
DANGER
OF

ON
THE

FALLING
INTO
THE
ABSURDITIES
OF
THE

t_PLATONISTS
SIL
IN
THE
PRESENT

WE
ARE
WELL
AWARE
THAT
AN
ANCIENT
PHILOSOPHER
IS
TO
BE
INTERPRETED
FROM
HIMSELF
AND
BY
THE
CONTEMPORARY
HISTORY
OF
t_THOUGHT
SIL
THE
FANCIES
OF
THE
NEO
PLATONISTS
ARE
ONLY
INTERESTING
TO
US
BECAUSE
THEY
EXHIBIT
A
PHASE
OF
THE
HUMAN
MIND
WHICH
PREVAILED
WIDELY
IN
THE
FIRST
CENTURIES
OF
THE
CHRISTIAN
ERA
AND
IS
NOT
WHOLLY
EXTINCT
IN
OUR
OWN
t_DAY
SIL
BUT
THEY
HAVE
NOTHING
TO
DO
WITH
THE
INTERPRETATION
OF
PLATO
AND
IN

THEY
ARE
OPPOSED
TO
t_HIM

WE
DO
NOT
KNOW
HOW
PLATO
WOULD
HAVE
ARRANGED
HIS
OWN
DIALOGUES
OR
WHETHER
THE
THOUGHT
OF
ARRANGING
ANY
OF
THEM
BESIDES
THE
TWO
TRILOGIES
WHICH
HE
HAS
EXPRESSLY
CONNECTED
WAS
EVER
PRESENT
TO
HIS

THE

IS
PRIMARILY
CONCERNED
WITH

CREATION
INCLUDING
UNDER
THIS

THE
HEAVENLY

AND
WITH

ONLY
AS

AMONG

BUT
HE
HAS
NOT
AS

DEFINED
THIS
INTERMEDIATE
TERRITORY
WHICH
LIES
SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN

AND

AND
HE
WOULD
HAVE
FELT
THAT
THERE
WAS
AS
GREAT
AN
IMPIETY
IN
RANKING
THEORIES
OF
PHYSICS
FIRST
IN
THE
ORDER
OF

AS
IN
PLACING
THE

BEFORE
THE

WITH
HERACLEITUS
HE
ACKNOWLEDGES
THE
PERPETUAL
FLUX
LIKE
ANAXAGORAS
HE
ASSERTS
THE
PREDOMINANCE
OF

ALTHOUGH
ADMITTING
AN
ELEMENT
OF

IS
INCAPABLE

SUPPOSES

CONTAINED

MANY
IF
NOT
ALL
THE
ELEMENTS
OF
THE
PRE
SOCRATIC
PHILOSOPHY
ARE

IN
THE
t_TIMAEUS

IT
IS
PROBABLE
THAT
THE
RELATION
OF
THE
IDEAS
TO
GOD
OR
OF
GOD
TO
THE

WAS
DIFFERENTLY
CONCEIVED
BY
HIM
AT

THE

THEY
HAVE

THE
STYLE
AND

OF
THE

DIFFER
GREATLY
FROM
THAT
OF
ANY

HAS
NOT
THE

MASTERY
OVER
HIS

HE
EXHIBITS
IN

NOTHING

EXCEED
THE

OF
THE

IS

ACCUSTOMED

IN
THE

OF

THE

THE
DRAMATIC

IS
WHOLLY
GIVEN
t_UP

HE
COULD

BEEN

TO

HENCE
WE
FIND
THE

SORT
OF
CLUMSINESS
IN
THE

OF

WHICH
CHARACTERIZES
THE
PHILOSOPHICAL

OF
t_LUCRETIUS

THERE
IS
A
WANT
OF

AND
OFTEN
A
DEFECT

SOMETIMES
OBSCURE

THERE
IS
A
GREATER

OF

OCCURS
IN

THE

SO
THOSE

IN

WHENEVER

CONSISTENTLY
THESE
TWO

THE
DEPENDENT
WHO
WAS
FIRST
DELEGATED
FOR
THESE
DUTIES
WAS
THE

AS
WOULD
BE
EXPECTED
IN
THE
LATER

WHEN
THE

OF

THESE
DUTIES
ARE
CUSTOMARILY
PERFORMED
GRADUALLY
NARROWS
THE

REMAINS
THE
t_LAST

AS
WE
DESCEND
THE
SOCIAL

THE
POINT
IS
PRESENTLY
REACHED
WHERE
THE
DUTIES
OF
VICARIOUS
LEISURE
AND
CONSUMPTION
DEVOLVE
UPON
THE

t_ALONE

IN
THE
COMMUNITIES
OF

THIS

AT

AMONG

THE

IT
IS

THEREFORE
THAT
THE

OF

IN
THE
DIRECTION
OF

THE
UTILITY

AS
COMPARED
WITH

IT
IS
ALSO
NOTICEABLE
THAT
THE
SERVICEABILITY
OF

AS
A
MEANS
OF

AS

AS
THE
INSISTENCE
ON
IT
AS
AN
ELEMENT

AT
ITS
BEST
IN
THOSE
PORTIONS
OF
THE

WHERE
THE

CONTACT
OF
THE

AND
THE

THE

EVENLY

THE

BEEN
SOMEWHAT

HEART
HAD
RECEIVED
A
SHOCK
IN
THE
PERCEPTION
OF
ANNE'S
DELICACY
AND
ALL
THESE
HOLIDAYS
SHE
WATCHED
OVER
HER
WITH
THE
LONGING
FOND
ANXIETY
WHICH
IS
SO
FULL
OF
SUDDEN
PANGS
OF
t_FEAR
SIL
I
DOUBT
WHETHER
BRANWELL
WAS
MAINTAINING
HIMSELF
AT
THIS
t_TIME
SIL
TO
CELEBRATE
THE
ARRIVAL
OF
HER
SON
SILVIA
GAVE
A
SPLENDID
SUPPER
TO
WHICH
SHE
HAD
INVITED
ALL
HER
RELATIVES
AND
IT
WAS
A
GOOD
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
ME
TO
MAKE
THEIR
t_ACQUAINTANCE
SIL
WITHOUT
SAYING
IT
POSITIVELY
SHE
MADE
ME
UNDERSTAND
THAT
BEING
HERSELF
AN
ILLUSTRIOUS
MEMBER
OF
THE
REPUBLIC
OF
LETTERS
SHE
WAS
WELL
AWARE
THAT
SHE
WAS
SPEAKING
TO
AN
t_INSECT
SIL
IN
ORDER
TO
PLEASE
HER
I
SPOKE
TO
HER
OF
THE
ABBE
CONTI
AND
I
HAD
OCCASION
TO
QUOTE
TWO
LINES
OF
THAT
PROFOUND
t_WRITER
SIL
MADAM
CORRECTED
ME
WITH
A
PATRONIZING
AIR
FOR
MY
PRONUNCIATION
OF
THE
WORD
<UNK>
WHICH
MEANS
DIVIDED
SAYING
THAT
IT
OUGHT
TO
BE
PRONOUNCED
<UNK>
AND
SHE
ADDED
THAT
I
OUGHT
TO
BE
VERY
GLAD
TO
HAVE
LEARNED
SO
MUCH
ON
THE
FIRST
DAY
OF
MY
ARRIVAL
IN
PARIS
TELLING
ME
THAT
IT
WOULD
BE
AN
IMPORTANT
DAY
IN
MY
t_LIFE
SIL
HER
FACE
WAS
AN
ENIGMA
FOR
IT
INSPIRED
EVERYONE
WITH
THE
WARMEST
SYMPATHY
AND
YET
IF
YOU
EXAMINED
IT
ATTENTIVELY
THERE
WAS
NOT
ONE
BEAUTIFUL
FEATURE
SHE
COULD
NOT
BE
CALLED
HANDSOME
BUT
NO
ONE
COULD
HAVE
THOUGHT
HER
t_UGLY
SIL
SILVIA
WAS
THE
ADORATION
OF
FRANCE
AND
HER
TALENT
WAS
THE
REAL
SUPPORT
OF
ALL
THE
COMEDIES
WHICH
THE
GREATEST
AUTHORS
WROTE
FOR
HER
ESPECIALLY
OF
THE
PLAYS
OF
MARIVAUX
FOR
WITHOUT
HER
HIS
COMEDIES
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
GONE
TO
t_POSTERITY
SIL
SILVIA
DID
NOT
THINK
THAT
HER
GOOD
CONDUCT
WAS
A
MERIT
FOR
SHE
KNEW
THAT
SHE
WAS
VIRTUOUS
ONLY
BECAUSE
HER
SELF
LOVE
COMPELLED
HER
TO
BE
SO
AND
SHE
NEVER
EXHIBITED
ANY
PRIDE
OR
ASSUMED
ANY
SUPERIORITY
TOWARDS
HER
THEATRICAL
SISTERS
ALTHOUGH
SATISFIED
TO
SHINE
BY
THEIR

OR
THEIR

THEY
CARED
LITTLE
ABOUT
RENDERING
THEMSELVES
CONSPICUOUS
BY
THEIR
t_VIRTUE
SIL
TWO
YEARS
BEFORE

DEATH
I
SAW
HER
PERFORM
THE
CHARACTER
OF
MARIANNE
IN
THE
COMEDY
OF
MARIVAUX
AND
IN
SPITE
OF
HER
AGE
AND
DECLINING
HEALTH
THE
ILLUSION
WAS
t_COMPLETE
SIL
SHE
WAS
HONOURABLY
BURIED
IN
THE

SAUVEUR
WITHOUT
THE

OPPOSITION
FROM
THE
VENERABLE
PRIEST
WHO
FAR
FROM
SHARING
THE
ANTI
<UNK>
<UNK>
OF
THE

IN

SAID
THAT
HER

AS
AN

HAD
NOT
HINDERED
HER
FROM
BEING
A
GOOD
CHRISTIAN
AND
THAT
THE

WAS
THE

A

READING
THE

UNDER

EITHER

SIT
DOWN
AT

I
TELL

TO

SOME

IF

THEN
TURNING
TOWARDS

HE
SAYS
THAT
I
LOOK
LIKE
A

AND
WHEN
I
SAY
THAT
I
AM
AN

HE
BEGINS
TO
SPEAK
TO

OF
THE

OF
THE

OF

AND
AT

HE

TO
ACCOMPANY

I
THANK
HIM
AND
TAKE
MY

I
ADDRESS

IN

AND
HE

WITTILY

HIS

OF

MAKES
ME

AND
I
TELL
HIM
t_WHY
SIL
MY
REMARK
PLEASES
HIM
BUT
I
SOON
PROVE
TO
HIM
THAT
IT
IS
NOT
THE
RIGHT
WAY
TO
SPEAK
HOWEVER
PERFECT
MAY
HAVE
BEEN
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
THAT
ANCIENT
t_WRITER

I
SEE
A

IN

OF

EVERYBODY
STANDING
STILL
AND
LOOKING
t_UP
SIL
IS
THERE
NOT
A

t_EVERYWHERE

THE

t_EXACT

BUT
THAT

AT
THE

IS
IT
BETTER
THAN
ANYWHERE
t_ELSE
SIL
BUT
HOW
DID
SHE
MANAGE
TO
RENDER
IT
SO
t_FASHIONABLE
SIL
SIMPLY
BY
STOPPING
HER
CARRIAGE
TWO
OR
THREE
TIMES
BEFORE
THE

TO
HAVE
HER
SNUFF
BOX
FILLED
AND
BY
SAYING
ALOUD
TO
THE

WHO

BACK
THE

THAT
HER

WAS
THE

BEST
IN

YOU

FOR

IS
TRULY
A
CHARACTERISTIC
OF
THE

HERE
AND
HOWEVER

IT
MAY
APPEAR
SILLINESS
IS
THE
DAUGHTER
OF
t_WIT

LET
A

RUN
AND
EVERYBODY
WILL
RUN
AFTER
HIM
THE

WILL
NOT
STOP
UNLESS
THE

IS
PROVED
TO
BE

BUT
TO

IT
IS
INDEED
A

A

WHO
MAD
FROM

SUCH

OF
THE

IS
RATHER
A

THAT

TO
SUCH
AN

TO

HE
HIMSELF
RECITED
THE

IN

THAT
I

IMPROVED

SIR
HARRY

MISTER
BARTLEY
ALEXANDER
THE
AMERICAN
t_ENGINEER
SIL
I

SIR

THE
LITTLE
GIRL'S
GOING
FAMOUSLY
TO

t_SHE
SIL
DO
YOU

I
THOUGHT

A
BIT
CONSCIOUS
TO
NIGHT
FOR
THE
FIRST
t_TIME
SIL
<UNK>
AND
I
WERE
BACK
AFTER
THE
FIRST
ACT
AND
WE
THOUGHT
SHE
SEEMED
QUITE
UNCERTAIN
OF
t_HERSELF
SIL
A
LITTLE
ATTACK
OF
NERVES
t_POSSIBLY
SIL
HE
WAS
BEGINNING
TO
FEEL
A
KEEN
INTEREST
IN
THE
SLENDER
BAREFOOT
DONKEY
GIRL
WHO
SLIPPED
IN
AND
OUT
OF
THE
PLAY
SINGING
LIKE
SOME
ONE
WINDING
THROUGH
A
HILLY
t_FIELD
SIL
ONE
NIGHT
WHEN
HE
AND
WINIFRED
WERE
SITTING
TOGETHER
ON
THE
BRIDGE
HE
TOLD
HER
THAT
THINGS
HAD
HAPPENED
WHILE
HE
WAS
STUDYING
ABROAD
THAT
HE
WAS
SORRY
FOR
ONE
THING
IN

AND
HE
ASKED
HER
WHETHER
SHE
THOUGHT
SHE
OUGHT
TO
KNOW
ABOUT
t_THEM
SIL
SHE
CONSIDERED
A
MOMENT
AND
THEN
SAID
NO
I
THINK
NOT
THOUGH
I
AM
GLAD
YOU
ASK
t_ME
SIL
AFTER
THAT
IT
WAS
EASY
TO
FORGET
ACTUALLY
TO
t_FORGET
SIL
OF
COURSE
HE
REFLECTED
SHE
ALWAYS
HAD
THAT
COMBINATION
OF
SOMETHING
HOMELY
AND
SENSIBLE
AND
SOMETHING
UTTERLY
WILD
AND
t_DAFT
SIL
SHE
MUST
CARE
ABOUT
THE
THEATRE
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
THAN
SHE
USED
t_TO
SIL
I'M
GLAD
SHE'S
HELD
HER
OWN
t_SINCE
SIL
AFTER
ALL
WE
WERE
AWFULLY
t_YOUNG
SIL
I
SHOULDN'T
WONDER
IF
SHE
COULD
LAUGH
ABOUT
IT
WITH
ME
t_NOW
SIL
HILDA
WAS
VERY
NICE
TO
HIM
AND
HE
SAT
ON
THE
EDGE
OF
HIS
CHAIR
FLUSHED
WITH
HIS
CONVERSATIONAL
EFFORTS
AND
MOVING
HIS
CHIN
ABOUT
NERVOUSLY
OVER
HIS
HIGH
t_COLLAR
SIL
THEY
ASKED
HIM
TO
COME
TO
SEE
THEM
IN

TENDERLY

t_FANCY

THEN
THERE
WAS

SIL
THERE
CERTAINLY

NO

SIL
IF
I
GO

I

WHERE
THE

ARE

AND
I
CAN
SEE
THE

AND
HEAR
THE

OF
THE

SIL
IT'S
SUCH
A
CRUSH
AT
THE

AT
ARCH
STREET
AND
THEN
THERE'S
THE

OF

LOOKING
YOUNG
MEN
WHO
LINE
THE

AND
STARE
AT

AS
WE
COME
t_OUT
SIL
HE
DOESN'T

BUT
IT'S
ON
THE
FRONTIER
AND
ON
THE

EVERYTHING
BEYOND
IT
IS

INDIANS
AND
DESERT
AND
LOOKS
AS
DESOLATE
AS
A
WEDNESDAY

HUMPH
IT
WAS
TIME
FOR

TO

t_SOMETHING
SIL
IS
HE
GOING
TO

A

AMONG

A

SIL
FATHER
THEE'S
UNJUST
TO
PHILIP
HE'S
GOING
INTO
t_BUSINESS
SIL
HE
DOESN'T
SAY
EXACTLY
WHAT
IT
IS
SAID
RUTH
A
LITTLE
DUBIOUSLY
BUT
IT'S
SOMETHING
ABOUT
LAND
AND
RAILROADS
AND
THEE
KNOWS
FATHER
THAT
FORTUNES
ARE
MADE
NOBODY
KNOWS
EXACTLY
HOW
IN
A
NEW
t_COUNTRY
SIL
BUT
PHILIP
IS
HONEST
AND
HE
HAS
TALENT
ENOUGH
IF
HE
WILL
STOP
SCRIBBLING
TO
MAKE
HIS
t_WAY
SIL
WHAT
A

ARE
PUT
INTO
MEASURED
FOR

AND
PUT
IN

IF
WE
GO
ANYWHERE
IT'S
IN
A

VEILED

PINIONED
AND
SHUT
IN
BY
t_DISABILITIES
SIL
WHY
SHOULD
I
RUST
AND
BE
STUPID
AND
SIT
IN
INACTION
BECAUSE
I
AM
A
t_GIRL
SIL
AND
IF
I
HAD
A
FORTUNE
WOULD
THEE
WANT
ME
TO
LEAD
A
USELESS
t_LIFE
SIL
HAS
THEE
CONSULTED
THY
MOTHER
ABOUT
A
CAREER
I
SUPPOSE
IT
IS
A
CAREER
THEE
t_WANTS
SIL
BUT
THAT
WISE
AND
PLACID
WOMAN
UNDERSTOOD
THE
SWEET
REBEL
A
GREAT
DEAL
BETTER
THAN
RUTH
UNDERSTOOD
t_HERSELF
SIL
RUTH
WAS
GLAD
TO
HEAR
THAT
PHILIP
HAD
MADE
A
PUSH
INTO
THE
WORLD
AND
SHE
WAS
SURE
THAT
HIS
TALENT
AND
COURAGE
WOULD
MAKE
A
WAY
FOR
t_HIM
SIL
BUT
THE
MORE
FORGETFULNESS
HAD
THEN
PREVAILED
THE
MORE
POWERFUL
WAS
THE
FORCE
OF
REMEMBRANCE
WHEN
SHE
t_AWOKE
SIL
MISS
MILNER'S
HEALTH
IS
NOT
t_GOOD
SIL
SAID
MISSUS
HORTON
A
FEW
MINUTES
t_AFTER

SO
THERE
IS
TO
ME
ADDED
SANDFORD
WITH
A
SARCASTIC
t_SNEER
SIL
AND
YET
YOU
MUST
OWN
HER
BEHAVIOUR
HAS
WARRANTED
THEM
HAS
IT
NOT
BEEN
IN
THIS

INCOHERENT
AND
t_UNACCOUNTABLE
SIL
NOT
THAT
I
KNOW
OF
NOT
ONE
MORE
THAT
I
KNOW
OF

REPLIED
WITH
ASTONISHMENT
AT
WHAT
SHE
HAD
INSINUATED
AND

WITH
A
PERFECT
ASSURANCE
THAT
SHE
WAS
IN
THE
t_WRONG
SIL
PERHAPS
I
AM
MISTAKEN
ANSWERED
t_SHE
SIL
TO
ASK
ANY
MORE
QUESTIONS
OF
YOU
I
BELIEVE
WOULD
BE
t_UNFAIR
SIL
HE
SEEMED
TO
WAIT
FOR
HER
REPLY
BUT
AS
SHE
MADE
NONE
HE
t_PROCEEDED
SIL
OH
MY

CRIED
MISS
WOODLEY
WITH
A
MOST
FORCIBLE
ACCENT
YOU
ARE
THE
LAST
PERSON
ON

SHE
WOULD
PARDON
ME
FOR

BUT
IN
SUCH
A
CASE
MISS
MILNER'S
ELECTION
OF
A
HUSBAND
SHALL
NOT
DIRECT
t_MINE
SIL
IF
SHE
DOES
NOT
KNOW
HOW
TO
ESTIMATE
HER

I
t_DO
SIL
INDEPENDENT
OF
HER
FORTUNE
SHE
HAS
BEAUTY
TO
CAPTIVATE
THE
HEART
OF
ANY
MAN
AND
WITH
ALL
HER
FOLLIES
SHE
HAS
A
FRANKNESS
IN
HER
MANNER
AN
UNAFFECTED
WISDOM
IN
HER
THOUGHTS
A
VIVACITY
IN
HER
CONVERSATION
AND
WITHAL
A
SOFTNESS
IN
HER
DEMEANOUR
THAT
MIGHT
ALONE
ENGAGE
THE

OF
A
MAN
OF
THE
NICEST
SENTIMENTS
AND
THE

t_UNDERSTANDING
SIL
MY
LORD
MISS
MILNER'S
TASTE
IS
NOT
A
DEPRAVED
ONE
IT
IS
BUT
TOO
t_REFINED
SIL
WHAT
CAN
YOU
MEAN
BY
THAT
MISS
WOODLEY
YOU
TALK
t_MYSTERIOUSLY
SIL
IS
SHE
NOT
AFRAID
THAT
I
WILL
THWART
HER
t_INCLINATIONS
SIL
AGAIN
HE
SEARCHED
HIS
OWN
THOUGHTS
NOR
INEFFECTUALLY
AS
t_BEFORE
SIL
MISS
WOODLEY
WAS
TOO
LITTLE
VERSED
IN
THE
SUBJECT
TO
KNOW
THIS
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
NOT

AT

AT

NOT
TO
THE
EXTENT
OF

THROUGH

AND
ALL
THE
VARIOUS
OBSTACLES
THAT
STILL
MILITATED
AGAINST
THEIR
t_UNION
SIL
TO

FROM

HE
LAID
HIS

WITH

UPON
HIS

AND
SAID

YOU

t_ME
SIL
I
WILL
MAKE
NO
UNJUST
USE
OF

HE
REPLIED
WITH

I

I
HAVE
NEVER

HOWEVER
BEEN
VANQUISHED
BY

AND
EVEN
UPON
THIS

MY

DID
YOU

FOR

t_SEEN
SIL
WHEN
THE
BOY
WALKED
THROUGH
THE
STREETS
BLESSINGS
WERE
SHOWERED
UPON
HIM
BY
ALL
WHO
SAW
HIM
BLESSINGS
UPON
HIS
BEAUTY
UPON
THE
MOTHER
THAT
BORE
HIM
UPON
THE
FATHER
THAT
BEGOT
HIM
UPON
THOSE
WHO
BROUGHT
HIM
UP
SO
t_WELL
SIL
ONE
DAY
WHEN
THE
BOY
WAS
SENT
BY
HIS
GRANDFATHER
WITH
A
MESSAGE
TO
A
RELATION
HE
PASSED
ALONG
A
STREET
IN
WHICH
THERE
WAS
A
GREAT
CONCOURSE
OF
t_HORSEMEN
SIL
THE
BED
SHE
TOO
WELL
REMEMBERED
WAS
THERE
AND
ABOVE
ALL
THE
CABINET
ON
WHICH
HAD
STOOD
THE
IMAGE
SHE
HAD
TAKEN
AWAY
WAS
STILL
ON
THE
SAME
t_SPOT
SIL
LUIS
WAS
OUT
OF
DANGER
IN
A
FORTNIGHT
IN
A
MONTH
HE
ROSE
FROM
HIS
BED
AND
DURING
ALL
THAT
TIME
HE
WAS
VISITED
DAILY
BY
HIS
MOTHER
AND
GRANDMOTHER
AND
TREATED
BY
THE
MASTER
AND
MISTRESS
OF
THE
HOUSE
AS
IF
HE
WAS
THEIR
OWN
t_CHILD
SIL
THUS
SAYING
AND
PRESSING
THE
CRUCIFIX
TO
HER
BREAST
SHE
FELL
FAINTING
INTO
THE
ARMS
OF
DONA
<UNK>
WHO
AS
A
GENTLEWOMAN
TO
WHOSE
SEX
PITY
IS
AS
NATURAL
AS
CRUELTY
IS
TO
MAN
INSTANTLY
PRESSED
HER
LIPS
TO
THOSE
OF
THE
FAINTING
GIRL
SHEDDING
OVER
HER
SO
MANY
TEARS
THAT
THERE
NEEDED
NO
OTHER
SPRINKLING
OF
WATER
TO
RECOVER
LEOCADIA
FROM
HER
t_SWOON
SIL
I
HAVE
GREAT
THINGS
TO
TELL
YOU
SENOR
SAID
DONA
<UNK>
TO
HER
HUSBAND
THE
CREAM
AND
SUBSTANCE
OF
WHICH
IS
THIS
THE
FAINTING
GIRL
BEFORE
YOU
IS
YOUR
DAUGHTER
AND
THAT
BOY
IS
YOUR
t_GRANDSON
SIL
THIS
TRUTH
WHICH
I
HAVE
LEARNED
FROM
HER
LIPS
IS
CONFIRMED
BY
HIS
FACE
IN
WHICH
WE
HAVE
BOTH
BEHELD
THAT
OF
OUR
t_SON
SIL
JUST
THEN
LEOCADIA
CAME
TO
HERSELF
AND
EMBRACING
THE
CROSS
SEEMED
CHANGED
INTO
A
SEA
OF
TEARS
AND
THE
GENTLEMAN
REMAINED
IN
UTTER
BEWILDERMENT
UNTIL
HIS
WIFE
HAD
REPEATED
TO
HIM
FROM
BEGINNING
TO
END
<UNK>
WHOLE
STORY
AND
HE
BELIEVED
IT
THROUGH
THE
BLESSED
DISPENSATION
OF
HEAVEN
WHICH
HAD
CONFIRMED
IT
BY
SO
MANY
CONVINCING
t_TESTIMONIES
SIL
SO
PERSUASIVE
WERE
HER
ENTREATIES
AND
SO
STRONG
HER
ASSURANCES
THAT
NO
HARM
WHATEVER
COULD
RESULT
TO
THEM
FROM
THE
INFORMATION
SHE
SOUGHT
THEY
WERE
INDUCED
TO
CONFESS
THAT
ONE
SUMMER'S
NIGHT
THE
SAME
SHE
HAD
MENTIONED
THEMSELVES
AND
ANOTHER
FRIEND
BEING
OUT
ON
A
STROLL
WITH
RODOLFO
THEY
HAD
BEEN
CONCERNED
IN
THE
ABDUCTION
OF
A
GIRL
WHOM
RODOLFO
CARRIED
OFF
WHILST
THE
REST
OF
THEM
DETAINED
HER
FAMILY
WHO
MADE
A
GREAT
OUTCRY
AND
WOULD
HAVE
DEFENDED
HER
IF
THEY
t_COULD
SIL
FOR
GOD'S
SAKE
MY
LADY
MOTHER
GIVE
ME
A
WIFE
WHO
WOULD
BE
AN
AGREEABLE
COMPANION
NOT
ONE
WHO
WILL
DISGUST
ME
SO
THAT
WE
MAY
BOTH
BEAR
EVENLY
AND
WITH
MUTUAL
GOOD
WILL
THE
YOKE
IMPOSED
ON
US
BY
HEAVEN
INSTEAD
OF
PULLING
THIS
WAY
AND
THAT
WAY
AND
FRETTING
EACH
OTHER
TO
t_DEATH
SIL
HER
BEARING
WAS
GRACEFUL
AND
ANIMATED
SHE
LED
HER
SON
BY
THE
HAND
AND
BEFORE
HER
WALKED
TWO
MAIDS
WITH
WAX
LIGHTS
AND
SILVER
t_CANDLESTICKS
SIL
ALL
ROSE
TO
DO
HER
REVERENCE
AS
IF
SOMETHING
FROM
HEAVEN
HAD
MIRACULOUSLY
APPEARED
BEFORE
THEM
BUT
GAZING
ON
HER
ENTRANCED
WITH
ADMIRATION
NOT
ONE
OF
THEM
WAS
ABLE
TO
ADDRESS
A
SINGLE
WORD
TO
t_HER
SIL
SHE
REFLECTED
HOW
NEAR
SHE
STOOD
TO
THE
CRISIS
WHICH
WAS
TO
DETERMINE
WHETHER
SHE
WAS
TO
BE
BLESSED
OR
UNHAPPY
FOR
EVER
AND
RACKED
BY
THE
INTENSITY
OF
HER
EMOTIONS
SHE
SUDDENLY
CHANGED
COLOUR
HER
HEAD
DROPPED
AND
SHE
FELL
FORWARD
IN
A
SWOON
INTO
THE
ARMS
OF
THE
DISMAYED
t_<UNK>
SIL
HIS
MOTHER
HAD
LEFT
HER
TO
HIM
AS
BEING
HER
DESTINED
PROTECTOR
BUT
WHEN
SHE
SAW
THAT
HE
TOO
WAS
INSENSIBLE
SHE
WAS
NEAR
MAKING
A
THIRD
AND
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
SO
HAD
HE
NOT
COME
TO
t_HIMSELF
SIL
KNOW
THEN
SON
OF
MY
HEART
THAT
THIS
FAINTING
LADY
IS
YOUR
REAL
BRIDE
I
SAY
REAL
BECAUSE
SHE
IS
THE
ONE
WHOM
YOUR
FATHER
AND
I
HAVE
CHOSEN
FOR
YOU
AND
THE
PORTRAIT
WAS
A
t_PRETENCE
SIL
JUST
AT
THE
MOMENT
WHEN
THE
TEARS
OF
THE
PITYING
BEHOLDERS
FLOWED
FASTEST
AND
THEIR
EJACULATIONS
WERE
MOST
EXPRESSIVE
OF
DESPAIR
LEOCADIA
GAVE
SIGNS
OF
RECOVERY
AND
BROUGHT
BACK
GLADNESS
TO
THE
HEARTS
OF
t_ALL
SIL
WHEN
SHE
CAME
TO
HER
SENSES
AND
BLUSHING
TO
FIND
HERSELF
IN
<UNK>
ARMS
WOULD
HAVE
DISENGAGED
HERSELF
NO
SENORA
HE
SAID
THAT
MUST
NOT
BE
STRIVE
NOT
TO
WITHDRAW
FROM
THE
ARMS
OF
HIM
WHO
HOLDS
YOU
IN
HIS
t_SOUL
SIL
THIS
WAS
DONE
FOR
THE
EVENT
TOOK
PLACE
AT
A
TIME
WHEN
THE
CONSENT
OF
THE
PARTIES
WAS
SUFFICIENT
FOR
THE
CELEBRATION
OF
A
MARRIAGE
WITHOUT
ANY
OF
THE
PRELIMINARY
FORMALITIES
WHICH
ARE
NOW
SO
PROPERLY
t_REQUIRED
SIL
NOR
WAS
RODOLFO
LESS
SURPRISED
THAN
THEY
AND
THE
BETTER
TO
ASSURE
HIMSELF
OF
SO
WONDERFUL
A
FACT
HE
BEGGED
LEOCADIA
TO
GIVE
HIM
SOME
TOKEN
WHICH
SHOULD
MAKE
PERFECTLY
CLEAR
TO
HIM
THAT
WHICH
INDEED
HE
DID
NOT
DOUBT
SINCE
IT
WAS
AUTHENTICATED
BY
HIS
t_PARENTS
SIL
YOU
KNOW
CAPTAIN
t_LAKE
SIL
SAID
LORD
<UNK>
ADDRESSING
t_ME
SIL
HE
HAD
HIS
HAND
UPON
LAKE'S
t_SHOULDER
SIL
THEY
ARE
COUSINS
YOU
KNOW
WE
ARE
ALL
t_COUSINS
SIL
WHATEVER
LORD
<UNK>
SAID
MISS
BRANDON
RECEIVED
IT
VERY
GRACIOUSLY
AND
EVEN
WITH
A
MOMENTARY
t_SMILE
SIL
BUT
HER
GREETING
TO
CAPTAIN
LAKE
WAS
MORE
THAN
USUALLY
HAUGHTY
AND
FROZEN
AND
HER
FEATURES
I
FANCIED
PARTICULARLY
PROUD
AND
t_PALE
SIL
AT
DINNER
LAKE
WAS
EASY
AND
t_AMUSING
SIL
I'M
GLAD
YOU
LIKE
IT
SAYS
WYLDER
CHUCKLING
BENIGNANTLY
ON
IT
OVER
HIS
t_SHOULDER
SIL
I
BELIEVE
I
HAVE
A
LITTLE
TASTE
THAT
WAY
THOSE
ARE
ALL
REAL
YOU
KNOW
THOSE
t_JEWELS
SIL
AND
HE
PLACED
IT
IN
THAT
GENTLEMAN'S
FINGERS
WHO
NOW
TOOK
HIS
TURN
AT
THE
LAMP
AND
CONTEMPLATED
THE
LITTLE
PARALLELOGRAM
WITH
A
GLEAM
OF
SLY
t_AMUSEMENT
SIL
I
WAS
THINKING
IT'S
VERY
LIKE
THE
ACE
OF
HEARTS
ANSWERED
THE
CAPTAIN
SOFTLY
SMILING
t_ON
SIL
WHEREUPON
LAKE
LAUGHED
QUIETLY
STILL
LOOKING
ON
THE
ACE
OF
HEARTS
WITH
HIS
SLY
t_EYES
SIL
AND
WYLDER
LAUGHED
TOO
MORE
SUDDENLY
AND
NOISILY
THAN
THE
HUMOUR
OF
THE
JOKE
SEEMED
QUITE
TO
CALL
FOR
AND
GLANCED
A
GRIM
LOOK
FROM
THE
CORNERS
OF
HIS
EYES
ON
LAKE
BUT
THE
GALLANT
CAPTAIN
DID
NOT
SEEM
TO
PERCEIVE
IT
AND
AFTER
A
FEW
SECONDS
MORE
HE
HANDED
IT
VERY
INNOCENTLY
BACK
TO
MISSUS
DOROTHY
ONLY
t_REMARKING
SIL
DO
YOU
KNOW
LAKE
OH
I
REALLY
CAN'T
TELL
BUT
HE'LL
SOON
TIRE
OF
COUNTRY
t_LIFE
SIL
HE'S
NOT
A
MAN
FOR
COUNTRY
t_QUARTERS
SIL
I
HAD
A
HORRID
DREAM
ABOUT
HIM
LAST
NIGHT
t_THAT
SIL
OH
I
KNOW
THAT'S
LORNE
t_BRANDON
SIL
ALL
THE
TIME
HE
WAS
TALKING
TO
ME
HIS
ANGRY
LITTLE
EYES
WERE
FOLLOWING
t_LAKE
SIL
MISS
LAKE
DECLINED
THE
CARRIAGE
TO
t_NIGHT
SIL
AND
HE
ADDED
SOMETHING
STILL
LESS
t_COMPLIMENTARY
SIL
BUT
DON'T
THESE
VERY
WISE
THINGS
SOMETIMES
TURN
OUT
VERY
t_FOOLISHLY
SIL
IN
THE
MEANTIME
I
HAD
FORMED
A
NEW
IDEA
OF
t_HER
SIL
BY
THIS
TIME
LORD
<UNK>
AND
WYLDER
RETURNED
AND
DISGUSTED
RATHER
WITH
MYSELF
I
RUMINATED
ON
MY
WANT
OF
GENERAL
t_SHIP
SIL
AND
HE
MADE
A
LITTLE
DIP
OF
HIS
CANE
TOWARDS
BRANDON
HALL
OVER
HIS
t_SHOULDER
SIL
YES
SO
THEY
SAID
BUT
THAT
WOULD
I
THINK
HAVE
BEEN
t_WORSE
SIL
IF
A
FELLOW'S
BEEN
A
LITTLE
BIT
WILD
HE'S
BEELZEBUB
AT
t_ONCE
SIL
<UNK>
A
VERY
GOOD
FELLOW
I
CAN
ASSURE
t_YOU
SIL
I
DON'T
KNOW
AND
CAN'T
SAY
HOW
YOU
FINE
GENTLEMEN
DEFINE
WICKEDNESS
ONLY
AS
AN
OBSCURE
FEMALE
I
SPEAK
ACCORDING
TO
MY
LIGHTS
AND
HE
IS
GENERALLY
THOUGHT
THE
WICKEDEST
MAN
IN
THIS
t_COUNTY
SIL
WELL
YOU
KNOW
<UNK>
WOMEN
LIKE
WICKED
FELLOWS
IT
IS
CONTRAST
I
SUPPOSE
BUT
THEY
DO
AND
I'M
SURE
FROM
WHAT
BRACTON
HAS
SAID
TO
ME
I
KNOW
HIM
INTIMATELY
THAT
DORCAS
LIKES
HIM
AND
I
CAN'T
CONCEIVE
WHY
THEY
ARE
NOT
t_MARRIED
SIL
THEIR
WALK
CONTINUED
SILENT
FOR
THE
GREATER
PART
NEITHER
WAS
QUITE
SATISFIED
WITH
THE
OTHER
BUT
RACHEL
AT
LAST
t_SAID
SIL
NOW
THAT'S
IMPOSSIBLE
<UNK>
FOR
I
REALLY
DON'T
THINK
I
ONCE
THOUGHT
OF
HIM
ALL
THIS
EVENING
EXCEPT
JUST
WHILE
WE
WERE
t_TALKING
SIL
THERE
WAS
A
BRIGHT
MOONLIGHT
BROKEN
BY
THE
SHADOWS
OF
OVERHANGING
BOUGHS
AND
WITHERED
LEAVES
AND
THE
MOTTLED
LIGHTS
AND
SHADOWS
GLIDED
ODDLY
ACROSS
HIS
PALE
t_FEATURES
SIL
DON'T
INSULT
ME
STANLEY
BY
TALKING
AGAIN
AS
YOU
DID
THIS
t_MORNING
SIL
WHAT
I
SAY
IS
ALTOGETHER
ON
YOUR
OWN
t_ACCOUNT
SIL
MARK
MY
WORDS
YOU'LL
FIND
HIM
TOO
STRONG
FOR
YOU
AYE
AND
TOO
t_DEEP
SIL
I
AM
VERY
UNEASY
ABOUT
IT
WHATEVER
IT
IS
I
CAN'T
HELP
t_IT
SIL
TO
MY
MIND
THERE
HAS
ALWAYS
BEEN
SOMETHING
INEXPRESSIBLY
AWFUL
IN
FAMILY
t_FEUDS
SIL
THE
MYSTERY
OF
THEIR
ORIGIN
THEIR
CAPACITY
FOR
EVOLVING
LATENT
FACULTIES
OF
CRIME
AND
THE
STEADY
VITALITY
WITH
WHICH
THEY
SURVIVE
THE
HEARSE
AND
SPEAK
THEIR
DEEP
MOUTHED
MALIGNITIES
IN
EVERY
NEW
BORN
GENERATION
HAVE
ASSOCIATED
THEM
SOMEHOW
IN
MY
MIND
WITH
A
SPELL
OF
LIFE
EXCEEDING
AND
DISTINCT
FROM
HUMAN
AND
A
SPECIAL
SATANIC
t_ACTION
SIL
THE
FLOOR
MORE
THAN
ANYTHING
ELSE
SHOWED
THE
GREAT
AGE
OF
THE
t_ROOM
SIL
MY
BED
WAS
UNEXCEPTIONABLY
COMFORTABLE
BUT
IN
MY
THEN
MOOD
I
COULD
HAVE
WISHED
IT
A
GREAT
DEAL
MORE
t_MODERN
SIL
ITS
CURTAINS
WERE
OF
THICK
AND
FADED
t_TAPESTRY
SIL
ALL
THE
FURNITURE
BELONGED
TO
OTHER
t_TIMES
SIL
I
SHAN'T
TROUBLE
YOU
ABOUT
MY
TRAIN
OF
THOUGHTS
OR
FANCIES
BUT
I
BEGAN
TO
FEEL
VERY
LIKE
A
GENTLEMAN
IN
A
GHOST
STORY
WATCHING
EXPERIMENTALLY
IN
A
HAUNTED
t_CHAMBER
SIL
I
DID
NOT
EVEN
TAKE
THE
PRECAUTION
OF
SMOKING
UP
THE
t_CHIMNEY
SIL
I
BOLDLY
LIGHTED
MY
t_CHEROOT
SIL
A
COLD
BRIGHT
MOON
WAS
SHINING
WITH
CLEAR
SHARP
LIGHTS
AND
t_SHADOWS
SIL
THE
SOMBRE
OLD

LIKE
GIGANTIC

BLACK
AND
t_AWFUL
SIL
SOMEHOW
I
HAD
GROWN
t_NERVOUS
SIL
A
LITTLE
BIT
OF

TUMBLED
DOWN
THE
CHIMNEY
AND
STARTLED
ME
t_CONFOUNDEDLY
SIL
IT
WAS
NOT
VERY
MUCH
PAST
ELEVEN
THAT
MORNING
WHEN
THE
PONY
CARRIAGE
FROM
BRANDON
DREW
UP
BEFORE
THE
LITTLE
GARDEN
WICKET
OF
REDMAN'S
t_FARM
SIL
WELL
SHE
WAS
BETTER
THOUGH
SHE
HAD
HAD
A
BAD
t_NIGHT
SIL
SO
THERE
CAME
A
STEP
AND
A
LITTLE
RUSTLING
OF
FEMININE
DRAPERIES
THE
SMALL
DOOR
OPENED
AND
RACHEL
ENTERED
WITH
HER
HAND
EXTENDED
AND
A
PALE
SMILE
OF
t_WELCOME
SIL
WOMEN
CAN
HIDE
THEIR
PAIN
BETTER
THAN
WE
MEN
AND
BEAR
IT
BETTER
TOO
EXCEPT
WHEN
SHAME
DROPS
FIRE
INTO
THE
DREADFUL
t_CHALICE
SIL
BUT
POOR
RACHEL
LAKE
HAD
MORE
THAN
THAT
STOICAL
HYPOCRISY
WHICH
ENABLES
THE
TORTURED
SPIRITS
OF
HER
SEX
TO
LIFT
A
PALE
FACE
THROUGH
THE
FLAMES
AND
t_SMILE
SIL
THIS
TRANSIENT
SPRING
AND
LIGHTING
UP
ARE
BEAUTIFUL
A
GLAMOUR
BEGUILING
OUR
t_SENSES
SIL
THERE
WAS
SOMETHING
OF
SWEETNESS
AND
FONDNESS
IN
HER
TONES
AND
MANNER
WHICH
WAS
NEW
TO
RACHEL
AND
COMFORTING
AND
SHE
RETURNED
THE
GREETING
AS
KINDLY
AND
FELT
MORE
LIKE
HER
FORMER
t_SELF
SIL
RACHEL'S
PALE
AND

STRUCK

WITH
A
PAINFUL
t_SURPRISE

AS

OF

AS

SHE
SPOKE
WITH
A
SUDDEN

AND
FLUSHED

A

FROM

ANOTHER
NOTE
HIS
COMING
DELAYED
AND
SOMETHING
OF
HIS
HAVING
TO
SEE
SOME
PERSON
WHO
IS
ABROAD
CONTINUED
DORCAS
AFTER
A
LITTLE
t_PAUSE
SIL
YES
SOMETHING
EVERYTHING

LOOKING
FROWNINGLY
AT
A
FLOWER
WHICH
SHE
WAS
TWIRLING
IN
HER
t_FINGERS
SIL
YES
SAID
t_RACHEL
SIL
AND
THE
WAN
ORACLE
HAVING
SPOKEN
SHE
SATE
DOWN
IN
THE
SAME
SORT
OF
ABSTRACTION
AGAIN
BESIDE
DORCAS
AND
SHE
LOOKED
FULL
IN
HER

t_EYES
SIL
OF
MARK
WYLDER
I
SAY
THIS
HIS
NAME
HAS
BEEN
FOR
YEARS
HATEFUL
TO

AND
RECENTLY
IT
HAS
BECOME
FRIGHTFUL
AND
YOU
WILL
PROMISE
ME
SIMPLY
THIS
THAT
YOU
WILL
NEVER
ASK
ME
TO
SPEAK
AGAIN
ABOUT
t_HIM
SIL
IT
IS
AN
ANTIPATHY
AN
ANTIPATHY
I
CANNOT
GET
OVER
DEAR

YOU
MAY
THINK
IT
A
MADNESS
BUT
DON'T
BLAME
t_ME
SIL
I
HAVE
VERY
FEW
TO

I
THOUGHT
YOU
MIGHT

ME
AS
I
HAVE
BEGUN
TO

t_YOU
SIL
AND
SHE
THREW
HER
ARMS
ROUND
HER
COUSIN'S

AND

INTO

OR
UNCLE
JOHN
OF

WILL
ROGERS'S
VISIT
BUT
THEY
GOT
MISTER
WATSON
IN
THE
LIBRARY
AND
QUESTIONED
HIM
CLOSELY
ABOUT
THE
PENALTY
FOR
FORGING
A
t_CHECK
SIL
IT
WAS
A
SERIOUS
CRIME
INDEED
MISTER
WATSON
TOLD
THEM
AND
TOM
GATES
BADE
FAIR
TO
SERVE
A
LENGTHY
TERM
IN
STATE'S
PRISON
AS
A
CONSEQUENCE
OF
HIS
RASH
t_ACT
SIL
I
CAN'T
SEE
IT
IN
THAT
LIGHT
SAID
THE
OLD
t_LAWYER
SIL
IT
WAS
A
DELIBERATE
THEFT
FROM
HIS
EMPLOYERS
TO
PROTECT
A
GIRL
HE
t_LOVED
SIL
BUT
THEY
COULD
NOT
HAVE
PROVEN
A
CASE
AGAINST
LUCY
IF
SHE
WAS
INNOCENT
AND
ALL
THEIR
THREATS
OF
ARRESTING
HER
WERE
PROBABLY
MERE
t_BLUFF
SIL
HE
WAS
SOFT
HEARTED
AND
IMPETUOUS
SAID
BETH
AND
BEING
IN
LOVE
HE
DIDN'T
STOP
TO
COUNT
THE
t_COST
SIL
IF
THE
PROSECUTION
WERE
WITHDRAWN
AND
THE
CASE
SETTLED
WITH
THE
VICTIM
OF
THE
FORGED
CHECK
THEN
THE
YOUNG
MAN
WOULD
BE
ALLOWED
HIS
t_FREEDOM
SIL
BUT
UNDER
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
DOUBT
IF
SUCH
AN
ARRANGEMENT
COULD
BE
t_MADE
SIL
FAIRVIEW
WAS
TWELVE
MILES
AWAY
BUT
BY
TEN
O'CLOCK
THEY
DREW
UP
AT

t_JAIL
SIL
THEY
WERE
RECEIVED
IN

BY

SIL
I
HEARD
A
NOISE
BEHIND

AND
SAW
<UNK>
HIS
BLACK
EYES
SHINING
WHILE
IN
HIS
HAND
HE
HELD
A
GLEAMING
KNIFE
HE
LIFTED
IT
ABOVE
HIS
HEAD
AS
IF
TO
STRIKE
BUT
I
HAD
THE
STRENGTH
OF
TEN
MEN
AND
I
HURLED
HIM
FROM
t_ME
SIL
ONWARD
SAID
A
DISTANT
t_VOICE
SIL
NO
SOUND
BROKE
THE
STILLNESS
OF
THE
t_NIGHT
SIL
THE
STORY
OF
ITS
EVIL
INFLUENCE
CAME
BACK
TO
ME
AND
IN
MY
BEWILDERED
CONDITION
I
WONDERED
WHETHER
THERE
WAS
NOT
SOME
TRUTH
IN
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
t_SAID
SIL
WHAT
WAS
t_THAT
SIL
WHAT
THEN
A
HUMAN
HAND
LARGE
AND
SHAPELY
APPEARED
DISTINCTLY
ON
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
t_POND
SIL
NOTHING
MORE
NOT
EVEN
THE
WRIST
TO
WHICH
IT
MIGHT
BE
t_ATTACHED
SIL
IT
DID
NOT
BECKON
OR
INDEED
MOVE
AT
ALL
IT
WAS
AS
STILL
AS
THE
HAND
OF
t_DEATH
SIL
I
AWOKE
TO
CONSCIOUSNESS
FIGHTING
AT
FIRST
IT
SEEMED
AS
IF
I
WAS
FIGHTING
WITH
A
PHANTOM
BUT
GRADUALLY
MY
OPPONENT
BECAME
MORE
REAL
TO
ME
IT
WAS
t_<UNK>
SIL
A
SOUND
OF
VOICES
A
FLASH
OF
t_LIGHT
SIL
A
FEELING
OF
FREEDOM
AND
I
WAS
AWAKE
t_WHERE
SIL
SAID
ANOTHER
VOICE
WHICH
I
RECOGNIZED
AS
VOLTAIRE'S
t_<UNK>
SIL
I
HAD
SCARCELY
KNOWN
WHAT
I
HAD
BEEN
SAYING
OR
DOING
UP
TO
THIS
TIME
BUT
AS
HE
SPOKE
I
LOOKED
AT
MY
t_HAND
SIL
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
THE
MOON
I
SAW
A
KNIFE
RED
WITH
BLOOD
AND
MY
HAND
TOO
WAS
ALSO
t_DISCOLOURED
SIL
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
I
AM
DAZED
t_BEWILDERED
SIL
BUT
THAT
IS
<UNK>
t_KNIFE
SIL
I
KNOW
HE
HAD
IT
THIS
VERY
t_EVENING
SIL
I
REMEMBER
SAYING
HAVE
WE
BEEN
t_TOGETHER
SIL
VOLTAIRE
PICKED
UP
SOMETHING
FROM
THE
GROUND
AND
LOOKED
AT
t_IT
SIL
I
SAY
YOU
DO
KNOW
WHAT
THIS
MEANS
AND
YOU
MUST
TELL
t_US
SIL
A
TERRIBLE
THOUGHT
FLASHED
INTO
MY
t_MIND
SIL
I
HAD
AGAIN
BEEN
ACTING
UNDER
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
THIS
MAN'S
t_POWER
SIL
PERCHANCE
TOO
<UNK>
DEATH
MIGHT
SERVE
HIM
IN
GOOD
t_STEAD
SIL
MY
TONGUE
REFUSED
TO
ARTICULATE
MY
POWER
OF

LEFT
t_ME
SIL
MY
POSITION
WAS
TOO
t_TERRIBLE
SIL
MY
OVERWROUGHT
NERVES
YIELDED
AT
t_LAST
SIL
FOR
SOME
TIME
AFTER
THAT
I
REMEMBERED
NOTHING
t_DISTINCTLY
SIL
THE
THREE
MODES
OF
t_MANAGEMENT
SIL
TO
SUPPOSE
THAT
THE
OBJECT
OF
THIS
WORK
IS
TO
AID
IN
EFFECTING
SUCH
A
SUBSTITUTION
AS
THAT
IS
ENTIRELY
TO
MISTAKE
ITS
NATURE
AND
t_DESIGN
SIL
BY
REASON
AND
t_AFFECTION
SIL
AS
THE
CHAISE
DRIVES
AWAY
MARY
STANDS
BEWILDERED
AND
PERPLEXED
ON
THE
DOOR
STEP
HER
MIND
IN
A
TUMULT
OF
EXCITEMENT
IN
WHICH
HATRED
OF
THE
DOCTOR
DISTRUST
AND
SUSPICION
OF
HER
MOTHER
DISAPPOINTMENT
VEXATION
AND
ILL
HUMOR
SURGE
AND
SWELL
AMONG
THOSE
DELICATE
ORGANIZATIONS
ON
WHICH
THE
STRUCTURE
AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF
THE
SOUL
SO
CLOSELY
DEPEND
DOING
PERHAPS
AN
IRREPARABLE
t_INJURY
SIL
THE
MOTHER
AS
SOON
AS
THE
CHAISE
IS
SO
FAR
TURNED
THAT
MARY
CAN
NO
LONGER
WATCH
THE
EXPRESSION
OF
HER
COUNTENANCE
GOES
AWAY
FROM
THE
DOOR
WITH
A
SMILE
OF
COMPLACENCY
AND
SATISFACTION
UPON
HER
FACE
AT
THE
INGENUITY
AND
SUCCESS
OF
HER
LITTLE
t_ARTIFICE
SIL
SO
YOU
WILL
BE
A
GOOD
GIRL
I
KNOW
AND
NOT
MAKE
ANY
TROUBLE
BUT
WILL
STAY
AT
HOME
CONTENTEDLY
WON'T
t_YOU
SIL
THE
MOTHER
IN
MANAGING
THE
CASE
IN
THIS
WAY
RELIES
PARTLY
ON
CONVINCING
THE
REASON
OF
THE
CHILD
AND
PARTLY
ON
AN
APPEAL
TO
HER
t_AFFECTION
SIL
IF
YOU
SHOULD
NOT
BE
A
GOOD
GIRL
BUT
SHOULD
SHOW
SIGNS
OF
MAKING
US
ANY
TROUBLE
I
SHALL
HAVE
TO
SEND
YOU
OUT
SOMEWHERE
TO
THE
BACK
PART
OF
THE
HOUSE
UNTIL
WE
ARE
t_GONE
SIL
BUT
THIS
LAST
SUPPOSITION
IS
ALMOST
ALWAYS
UNNECESSARY
FOR
IF
MARY
HAS
BEEN
HABITUALLY
MANAGED
ON
THIS
PRINCIPLE
SHE
WILL
NOT
MAKE
ANY
t_TROUBLE
SIL
IT
IS
INDEED
TRUE
THAT
THE
IMPORTANCE
OF
TACT
AND
SKILL
IN
THE
TRAINING
OF
THE
YOUNG
AND
OF
CULTIVATING
THEIR
REASON
AND
SECURING
THEIR
AFFECTION
CAN
NOT
BE
t_OVERRATED

TO
SUCH

THESE
INDIRECT
MODES
OF
TRAINING
CHILDREN
IN
HABITS
OF
SUBORDINATION
TO
THEIR

OR
RATHER
OF
YIELDING
TO
THEIR

ARE
SPECIALLY
t_USEFUL
SIL
DELLA
HAD
A
YOUNG
SISTER
NAMED
MARIA
AND
A
COUSIN
WHOSE

WAS
t_JANE
SIL
NOW
DELIA
CONTRIVED
TO
OBTAIN
A
GREAT

AND
ASCENDENCY
OVER
THE
MINDS
OF
THE

BY

OF
THESE
t_DOLLS

TO
GIVE
AN

OF
THESE

I
WILL
REPORT
ONE
OF
THEM
IN
t_FULL

YOU
HAVE
COME
<UNK>
<UNK>
WAS
THE

OF
JANE'S
DOLL
TO
MAKE
ROSALIE
A
t_VISIT
SIL
I
AM
VERY
t_GLAD
SIL
I
EXPECT
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
A
VERY
GOOD
GIRL
<UNK>
SINCE
YOU
WERE
HERE
t_LAST
SIL
THEN
TURNING
TO
JANE
SHE
ASKED
IN
A
SOMEWHAT
ALTERED
TONE
HAS
SHE
BEEN
A
GOOD
GIRL
t_JANE
SIL
FOR

ONE
DAY
THE
CHILDREN
HAD
BEEN
PLAYING
UPON
THE
PIAZZA
WITH
BLOCKS
AND
OTHER
PLAYTHINGS
AND
FINALLY
HAD
GONE
INTO
THE
HOUSE
LEAVING
ALL
THE
THINGS
ON
THE
FLOOR
OF
THE
PIAZZA
INSTEAD
OF
PUTTING
THEM
AWAY
IN
THEIR
PLACES
AS
THEY
OUGHT
TO
HAVE
t_DONE
SIL
THEY
WERE
NOW
PLAYING
WITH
THEIR
DOLLS
IN
THE
t_PARLOR
SIL
DELIA
CAME
TO
THE
PARLOR
AND
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
GREAT
MYSTERY
BECKONED
THE
CHILDREN
ASIDE
AND
SAID
TO
THEM
IN
A
WHISPER
LEAVE
<UNK>
AND
ROSALIE
HERE
AND
DON'T
SAY
A
WORD
TO
t_THEM
SIL
SO
SAYING
SHE
LED
THE
WAY
ON
TIPTOE
FOLLOWED
BY
THE
CHILDREN
OUT
OF
THE
ROOM
AND
ROUND
BY
A
CIRCUITOUS
ROUTE
TO
THE
PIAZZA
t_THERE
SIL
SAID
SHE
POINTING
TO
THE
PLAYTHINGS
t_SEE
SIL
PUT
THESE
PLAYTHINGS
ALL
AWAY
QUICK
AND
CAREFULLY
AND
WE
WILL
NOT
LET
THEM
KNOW
ANY
THING
ABOUT
YOUR
LEAVING
THEM
t_OUT
SIL
AND
THIS
METHOD
OF
TREATING
THE
CASE
WAS
MUCH
MORE
EFFECTUAL
IN
MAKING
THEM
DISPOSED
TO
AVOID
COMMITTING
A
SIMILAR
FAULT
ANOTHER
TIME
THAN
ANY
DIRECT
REBUKES
OR
EXPRESSIONS
OF
DISPLEASURE
ADDRESSED
PERSONALLY
TO
THEM
WOULD
HAVE
t_BEEN

NATURE
OF
THE

PRODUCED
BY
EARLY
t_IMPRESSIONS

THAT
IS
COMPARATIVELY
t_NOTHING

THEY
ARE
CHIEFLY
FORMED
FROM
COMBINATIONS
OF
THE

MADE
IN

VAST

AND
INFLUENCE
OF
THIS
MENTAL
t_FURNISHING
SIL
WITHOUT
GOING
TO
ANY
SUCH
EXTREME
AS
THIS
WE
CAN
EASILY
SEE
ON
REFLECTION
HOW
VAST
AN
INFLUENCE
ON
THE
IDEAS
AND
CONCEPTIONS
AS
WELL
AS
ON
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
ACTION
IN
MATURE
YEARS
MUST
BE
EXERTED
BY
THE
NATURE
AND
CHARACTER
OF
THE
IMAGES
WHICH
THE
PERIOD
OF
INFANCY
AND

IMPRESSES
UPON
THE
t_MIND
SIL
THE

PRODUCED
BY
AN
ACT
OF
HASTY
AND
ANGRY

TO
WHICH
A
FATHER
SUBJECTS
HIS

MAY
SOON
PASS
AWAY
BUT
THE

OF

DOES
NOT

AWAY
WITH

BUT
ANDERS
CARED
NOTHING
ABOUT
t_THAT
SIL

MADE
A

SO
DEEP

HIS

HE
WAS
DUMBFOUNDED
I

WAS
SUCH
A
BIG

CARRIED
A

SIL
NOW
THIS
KNIFE
WAS
A
SPLENDID
ONE

KNEW

A

YES

THE

HE
STILL

A

A

FOR

I'D
BETTER

AND
I
CAN
DO
THE

AND
YOU
SHALL
LEARN
JUST
WHAT

I
SHOULD

WITH

ON

THE

IS

BEING
THE
KEYNOTE
OF

A

TO
SOME
EXTENT
INDICATE
THE

AT

IT
WOULD
BE

THAT

WOULD
MISS
THE
FINER
SHADES
OF
THE

t_MEANING
SIL
WE
MODERNS
HOWEVER
SEE
THE
ABSURDITY
OF
t_IT
SIL
IF
IT

GRANTED
FIRST
THAT
THE
THOUGHTS
OF
A
CERTAIN

SHOULD
BE
KNOWN
TO
THE

AND
SECONDLY
THAT

OR
THE
HABIT
OF

IS
IN

HOW
SHALL
A

BE
AVOIDED
WITHOUT

TO
THE

WHEN

SOMETHING
NON

THIS
WOULD
BE
AN
EASY
WAY
OF
DOING
IT
BUT
IT
WOULD
NOT
BE
THE

FOR
THE
REASON
THAT
IT
IS
TOO
EASY
TO
CALL
ATTENTION
TO
t_ITSELF

IN
THE

BADLY

IT
WAS
FREQUENTLY

SOME
PARTS
MAY
FEEL
MORE
FAMILIAR
THAN
OTHERS
WHEN
THIS
HAPPENS
WE
HAVE
MORE
BELIEF
IN
THE
ACCURACY
OF
THE
FAMILIAR
PARTS
THAN
IN
THAT
OF
THE
UNFAMILIAR
t_PARTS
SIL
I
COME
NOW
TO
THE
OTHER
CHARACTERISTIC
WHICH
MEMORY
IMAGES
MUST
HAVE
IN
ORDER
TO
ACCOUNT
FOR
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
t_PAST
SIL
THEY
MUST
HAVE
SOME
CHARACTERISTIC
WHICH
MAKES
US
REGARD
THEM
AS
REFERRING
TO
MORE
OR
LESS
REMOTE
PORTIONS
OF
THE
t_PAST
SIL
IN
ACTUAL
FACT
THERE
ARE
DOUBTLESS
VARIOUS
FACTORS
THAT
CONCUR
IN
GIVING
US
THE
FEELING
OF
GREATER
OR
LESS
REMOTENESS
IN
SOME
REMEMBERED
t_EVENT
SIL
THERE
MAY
BE
A
SPECIFIC
FEELING
WHICH
COULD
BE
CALLED
THE
FEELING
OF
<UNK>
ESPECIALLY
WHERE
IMMEDIATE
MEMORY
IS
t_CONCERNED
SIL
THERE
IS
OF
COURSE
A
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
KNOWING
THE
TEMPORAL
RELATION
OF
A
REMEMBERED
EVENT
TO
THE
PRESENT
AND
KNOWING
THE
TIME
ORDER
OF
TWO
REMEMBERED
t_EVENTS
SIL
IT
WOULD
SEEM
THAT
ONLY
RATHER
RECENT
EVENTS
CAN
BE
PLACED
AT
ALL
ACCURATELY
BY
MEANS
OF
FEELINGS
GIVING
THEIR
TEMPORAL
RELATION
TO
THE
PRESENT
BUT
IT
IS
CLEAR
THAT
SUCH
FEELINGS
MUST
PLAY
AN
ESSENTIAL
PART
IN
THE
PROCESS
OF
DATING
REMEMBERED
t_EVENTS
SIL
IF
WE
HAD
RETAINED
THE
SUBJECT
OR
ACT
IN
KNOWLEDGE
THE
WHOLE
PROBLEM
OF
MEMORY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
COMPARATIVELY
t_SIMPLE
SIL
REMEMBERING
HAS
TO
BE
A
PRESENT
OCCURRENCE
IN
SOME
WAY
RESEMBLING
OR
RELATED
TO
WHAT
IS
t_REMEMBERED
SIL
SOME
POINTS
MAY
BE
TAKEN
AS
FIXED
AND
SUCH
AS
ANY
THEORY
OF
MEMORY
MUST
ARRIVE
t_AT
SIL
IN
THIS
CASE
AS
IN
MOST
OTHERS
WHAT
MAY
BE
TAKEN
AS
CERTAIN
IN
ADVANCE
IS
RATHER
t_VAGUE
SIL
THE
FIRST
OF
OUR
VAGUE
BUT
INDUBITABLE
DATA
IS
THAT
THERE
IS
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
t_PAST
SIL
WE
MIGHT
PROVISIONALLY
THOUGH
PERHAPS
NOT
QUITE
CORRECTLY
DEFINE
MEMORY
AS
THAT
WAY
OF
KNOWING
ABOUT
THE
PAST
WHICH
HAS
NO
ANALOGUE
IN
OUR
KNOWLEDGE
OF
THE
FUTURE
SUCH
A
DEFINITION
WOULD
AT
LEAST
SERVE
TO
MARK
THE
PROBLEM
WITH
WHICH
WE
ARE
CONCERNED
THOUGH
SOME
EXPECTATIONS
MAY
DESERVE
TO
RANK
WITH
MEMORY
AS
REGARDS
t_IMMEDIACY
SIL
THIS
DISTINCTION
IS
VITAL
TO
THE
UNDERSTANDING
OF
MEMORY
BUT
IT
IS
NOT
SO
EASY
TO
CARRY
OUT
IN
PRACTICE
AS
IT
IS
TO
DRAW
IN
t_THEORY
SIL
A
GRAMOPHONE
BY
THE
HELP
OF
SUITABLE
RECORDS
MIGHT
RELATE
TO
US
THE
INCIDENTS
OF
ITS
PAST
AND
PEOPLE
ARE
NOT
SO
DIFFERENT
FROM
GRAMOPHONES
AS
THEY
LIKE
TO
t_BELIEVE
SIL
I
CAN
SET
TO
WORK
NOW
TO
REMEMBER
THINGS
I
NEVER
REMEMBERED
BEFORE
SUCH
AS
WHAT
I
HAD
TO
EAT
FOR
BREAKFAST
THIS
MORNING
AND
IT
CAN
HARDLY
BE
WHOLLY
HABIT
THAT
ENABLES
ME
TO
DO
t_THIS
SIL
THE
FACT
THAT
A
MAN
CAN
RECITE
A
POEM
DOES
NOT
SHOW
THAT
HE
REMEMBERS
ANY
PREVIOUS
OCCASION
ON
WHICH
HE
HAS
RECITED

READ
t_IT
SIL
<UNK>
TWO
BOOKS
MENTIONED
IN

DO
NOT
TOUCH

AT
ALL
t_CLOSELY

THEY
GIVE
LAWS
ACCORDING
TO
WHICH
IMAGES
OF
PAST
OCCURRENCES
COME
INTO
OUR
MINDS
BUT
DO
NOT
DISCUSS
OUR
BELIEF
THAT
THESE
IMAGES
REFER
TO
PAST
OCCURRENCES
WHICH
IS
WHAT
CONSTITUTES
KNOWLEDGE
t_MEMORY

IT
IS
THIS
THAT
IS
OF
INTEREST
TO

OF
t_KNOWLEDGE
SIL
IT
IS
BY
NO

ALWAYS
RELIABLE
ALMOST
EVERYBODY
HAS
AT
SOME
TIME
EXPERIENCED
THE
WELL
KNOWN
ILLUSION
THAT
ALL
THAT
IS
HAPPENING
NOW
HAPPENED
BEFORE
AT
SOME
t_TIME
SIL
WHENEVER
THE
SENSE
OF
FAMILIARITY
OCCURS
WITHOUT
A
DEFINITE
OBJECT
IT
LEADS
US
TO
SEARCH
THE
ENVIRONMENT
UNTIL
WE
ARE
SATISFIED
THAT
WE
HAVE
FOUND
THE
APPROPRIATE
OBJECT
WHICH
LEADS
US
TO
THE
JUDGMENT
THIS
IS
t_FAMILIAR
SIL
THUS
NO
KNOWLEDGE
AS
TO
THE
PAST
IS
TO
BE
DERIVED
FROM
THE
FEELING
OF
FAMILIARITY
t_ALONE
SIL
A
FURTHER
STAGE
IS
t_RECOGNITION
SIL
RECOGNITION
IN
THIS
SENSE
DOES
NOT
NECESSARILY
INVOLVE
MORE
THAN
A
HABIT
OF
ASSOCIATION
THE
KIND
OF
OBJECT
WE
ARE
SEEING
AT
THE
MOMENT
IS
ASSOCIATED
WITH
THE
WORD
CAT
OR
WITH
AN
AUDITORY
IMAGE
OF
PURRING
OR
WHATEVER
OTHER
CHARACTERISTIC
WE
MAY
HAPPEN
TO
RECOGNIZE
IN
THE
CAT
OF
THE
t_MOMENT
SIL
WE
ARE
OF
COURSE
IN
FACT
ABLE
TO
JUDGE
WHEN
WE
RECOGNIZE
AN
OBJECT
THAT
WE
HAVE
SEEN
IT
BEFORE
BUT
THIS
JUDGMENT
IS
SOMETHING
OVER
AND
ABOVE
RECOGNITION
IN
THIS
FIRST
SENSE
AND
MAY
VERY
PROBABLY
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
ANIMALS
THAT
NEVERTHELESS
HAVE
THE
EXPERIENCE
OF
RECOGNITION
IN
THIS
FIRST
SENSE
OF
THE
t_WORD
SIL
THIS
KNOWLEDGE
IS
MEMORY
IN
ONE
SENSE
THOUGH
IN
ANOTHER
IT
IS
t_NOT
SIL
THERE
ARE
HOWEVER
SEVERAL
POINTS
IN
WHICH
SUCH
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
RECOGNITION
IS
INADEQUATE
TO
BEGIN
WITH
IT
MIGHT
SEEM
AT
FIRST
SIGHT
MORE
CORRECT
TO
DEFINE
RECOGNITION
AS
I
HAVE
SEEN
THIS
BEFORE
THAN
AS
THIS
HAS
EXISTED
t_BEFORE
SIL
THE
DEFINITION
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
DIFFICULT
BROADLY
SPEAKING
IT
IS
EVERYTHING
THAT
IS
CONNECTED
WITH
WHAT
I
AM
EXPERIENCING
NOW
BY
CERTAIN
LINKS
OF
WHICH
THE
VARIOUS
FORMS
OF
MEMORY
ARE
AMONG
THE
MOST
t_IMPORTANT
SIL
THUS
IF
I
RECOGNIZE
A
THING
THE
OCCASION
OF
ITS
PREVIOUS
EXISTENCE
IN
VIRTUE
OF
WHICH
I
RECOGNIZE
IT
FORMS
PART
OF
MY
EXPERIENCE
BY
DEFINITION
RECOGNITION
WILL
BE
ONE
OF
THE
MARKS
BY
WHICH
MY
EXPERIENCE
IS
SINGLED
OUT
FROM
THE
REST
OF
THE
t_WORLD
SIL
OF
COURSE
THE
WORDS
THIS
HAS
EXISTED
BEFORE
ARE
A
VERY
INADEQUATE
TRANSLATION
OF
WHAT
ACTUALLY
HAPPENS
WHEN
WE
FORM
A
JUDGMENT
OF
RECOGNITION
BUT
THAT
IS
UNAVOIDABLE
WORDS
ARE
FRAMED
TO
EXPRESS
A
LEVEL
OF
THOUGHT
WHICH
IS
BY
NO
MEANS
PRIMITIVE
AND
ARE
QUITE
INCAPABLE
OF
EXPRESSING
SUCH
AN
ELEMENTARY
OCCURRENCE
AS
t_RECOGNITION

I
REMAINED
THERE
ALONE
FOR
MANY

I
MUST

THAT
BEFORE

I
AM

ACCOMPLISHED

WE
SAT
WITH

SOME

HOW

DURING

JUST
LAY

t_DIE

I
WENT
TO

I
OBSERVED

UP
TO

IT
CANNOT
BE

THAT
WE

IT
IS
A

YOUR

IS
SO
SUPERIOR

I
CAN
ADVANCE
AS
TO
MAKE
US
HERE
FEEL
THAT
THERE
IS
NO

IN
YIELDING
TO
t_IT

NOT
A

HAD
YOUR

BEEN

SHOULD
HAVE

IT
MY

TO

WITH

QUITE

SAID
SIR

I
CAN
AFFORD

I
AM
ABSOLUTELY

I
DO
NOT

IN

ONE

NORTH
