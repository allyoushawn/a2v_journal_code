19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0004 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
19-198-0005 THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
19-198-0010 NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
19-198-0011 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
19-198-0013 HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0016 FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
19-198-0017 HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
19-198-0019 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
19-198-0020 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
19-198-0022 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
19-198-0023 AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
19-198-0025 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
19-198-0026 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
19-198-0029 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
19-198-0032 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
19-198-0034 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
19-198-0037 SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
19-227-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
19-227-0002 AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
19-227-0003 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0005 CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
19-227-0006 FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0009 ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
19-227-0011 HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
19-227-0012 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
19-227-0014 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0015 BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0018 THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
19-227-0020 DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
19-227-0021 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0023 AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0027 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0029 HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
19-227-0030 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0032 ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
19-227-0033 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0036 AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
19-227-0038 HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
19-227-0039 AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
19-227-0041 HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
19-227-0042 HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
19-227-0044 AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
19-227-0045 HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
19-227-0047 AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
19-227-0048 OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
19-227-0050 CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
19-227-0051 HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
19-227-0053 THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
19-227-0054 IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
19-227-0056 MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
19-227-0057 FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
19-227-0059 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
19-227-0060 THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
19-227-0062 I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
19-227-0063 IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
19-227-0065 HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
19-227-0066 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
19-227-0068 NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
19-227-0069 THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0071 HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
19-227-0072 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
26-495-0001 IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
26-495-0002 IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
26-495-0004 AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
26-495-0005 AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
26-495-0007 OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
26-495-0008 ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
26-495-0010 AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
26-495-0011 BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
26-495-0013 THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
26-495-0014 THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
26-495-0016 THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
26-495-0017 SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
26-495-0019 SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
26-495-0020 SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
26-495-0022 IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
26-495-0023 STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
26-495-0025 THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
26-495-0026 NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
26-495-0028 BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
26-495-0029 SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
26-495-0031 YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
26-495-0032 UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
26-495-0034 TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
26-495-0035 OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
26-495-0037 COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
26-495-0038 WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
26-495-0040 THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
26-495-0041 TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
26-495-0043 THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
26-495-0044 TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
26-495-0046 SO FULLY BECAUSE I KNOW NOT BUT IT MAY BE OF MOMENT TO THOSE WHO COME AFTER ME IF THEY COME TO BE BROUGHT TO THE SAME DISTRESS AND TO THE SAME MANNER OF MAKING THEIR CHOICE AND THEREFORE
26-495-0047 TO NOTE WHAT BECAME OF ME I HAD TWO IMPORTANT THINGS BEFORE ME
26-495-0049 HOWEVER GREAT IT WAS MY FEARS PERHAPS AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED TO BE MUCH GREATER THAN IT COULD BE
26-495-0050 MY TRADE WAS A SADDLER AND AS MY DEALINGS WERE CHIEFLY NOT BY A SHOP OR CHANCE TRADE BUT AMONG THE MERCHANTS TRADING TO THE ENGLISH COLONIES IN AMERICA SO MY EFFECTS LAY VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF SUCH
26-495-0052 WITHOUT ANY OVERSEER OR PERSON FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH THEM HAD BEEN TO HAZARD THE LOSS NOT ONLY OF MY TRADE BUT OF MY GOODS AND INDEED OF ALL I HAD IN THE WORLD I HAD AN ELDER BROTHER
26-495-0053 AT THE SAME TIME IN LONDON AND NOT MANY YEARS BEFORE COME OVER FROM PORTUGAL AND ADVISING WITH HIM HIS ANSWER WAS IN THREE WORDS
26-495-0055 FOR SAYS HE IS IT NOT AS REASONABLE THAT YOU SHOULD TRUST GOD WITH THE CHANCE OR RISK OF LOSING YOUR TRADE AS THAT YOU SHOULD STAY IN SO EMINENT A POINT OF DANGER AND TRUST HIM WITH YOUR LIFE I COULD NOT
26-495-0056 I SAY AS MANY DID BECAUSE SEVERAL DID SO AT LAST ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAD BEEN IN THE ARMIES IN THE WAR WHICH HAD NOT BEEN MANY YEARS PAST AND I MUST NEEDS SAY THAT SPEAKING OF SECOND CAUSES
26-495-0058 BUT THEN MY SERVANT WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO TAKE DOWN WITH ME DECEIVED ME AND BEING FRIGHTED AT THE INCREASE OF THE DISTEMPER AND NOT KNOWING WHEN I SHOULD GO HE TOOK OTHER MEASURES AND LEFT ME
26-495-0059 SO I WAS PUT OFF FOR THAT TIME AND ONE WAY OR OTHER I ALWAYS FOUND THAT TO APPOINT TO GO AWAY WAS ALWAYS CROSSED BY SOME ACCIDENT OR OTHER SO AS TO DISAPPOINT AND PUT IT OFF AGAIN
26-495-0061 AND WOULD BE DIRECTED WHAT TO DO IN IT NAMELY THAT HE SHOULD KEEP HIS EYE UPON THE PARTICULAR PROVIDENCES WHICH OCCUR AT THAT TIME AND LOOK UPON THEM COMPLEXLY AS THEY REGARD ONE ANOTHER
26-495-0062 AND AS ALL TOGETHER REGARD THE QUESTION BEFORE HIM AND THEN I THINK HE MAY SAFELY TAKE THEM FOR INTIMATIONS FROM HEAVEN OF WHAT IS HIS UNQUESTIONED DUTY TO DO IN SUCH A CASE I MEAN
26-495-0064 THAT WOULD SURROUND ME AND THAT IF I ATTEMPTED TO SECURE MYSELF BY FLEEING FROM MY HABITATION AND ACTED CONTRARY TO THESE INTIMATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE DIVINE IT WAS A KIND OF
26-495-0065 FLYING FROM GOD AND THAT HE COULD CAUSE HIS JUSTICE TO OVERTAKE ME WHEN AND WHERE HE THOUGHT FIT THESE THOUGHTS QUITE TURNED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN AND WHEN I CAME TO DISCOURSE WITH MY BROTHER AGAIN
26-495-0067 MY BROTHER THOUGH A VERY RELIGIOUS MAN HIMSELF LAUGHED AT ALL I HAD SUGGESTED ABOUT ITS BEING AN INTIMATION FROM HEAVEN AND TOLD ME SEVERAL STORIES OF SUCH FOOLHARDY PEOPLE AS HE CALLED THEM
26-495-0068 AS I WAS THAT I OUGHT INDEED TO SUBMIT TO IT AS A WORK OF HEAVEN IF I HAD BEEN ANY WAY DISABLED BY DISTEMPERS OR DISEASES AND THAT THEN NOT BEING ABLE TO GO
26-495-0070 ONLY BECAUSE I COULD NOT HIRE A HORSE TO GO OR MY FELLOW WAS RUN AWAY THAT WAS TO ATTEND ME WAS RIDICULOUS SINCE AT THE TIME I HAD MY HEALTH AND LIMBS AND OTHER SERVANTS AND MIGHT
26-495-0071 AND IN OTHER PLACES WHERE HE HAD BEEN FOR MY BROTHER BEING A MERCHANT WAS A FEW YEARS BEFORE AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED RETURNED FROM ABROAD COMING LAST FROM LISBON AND HOW
26-495-0073 WHEREAS THE EUROPEANS OR CHRISTIAN MERCHANTS WHO KEPT THEMSELVES RETIRED AND RESERVED GENERALLY ESCAPED THE CONTAGION UPON THESE ARGUMENTS MY BROTHER CHANGED MY RESOLUTIONS AGAIN
26-495-0074 AND I BEGAN TO RESOLVE TO GO AND ACCORDINGLY MADE ALL THINGS READY FOR IN SHORT THE INFECTION INCREASED ROUND ME
26-495-0076 IRRESOLUTE AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I HAD SET THE EVENING WHOLLY APART TO CONSIDER SERIOUSLY ABOUT IT AND WAS ALL ALONE FOR ALREADY PEOPLE HAD AS IT WERE BY A GENERAL CONSENT
26-495-0077 WHAT WAS MY DUTY TO DO AND I STATED THE ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH MY BROTHER HAD PRESSED ME TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY AND I SET AGAINST THEM THE STRONG IMPRESSIONS WHICH I HAD ON MY MIND FOR STAYING THE VISIBLE CALL I SEEMED TO HAVE
26-495-0079 I OBEYED THIS LAY CLOSE TO ME AND MY MIND SEEMED MORE AND MORE ENCOURAGED TO STAY THAN EVER AND SUPPORTED WITH A SECRET SATISFACTION THAT I SHOULD BE KEPT ADD TO THIS THAT
26-495-0080 AND AT THAT JUNCTURE I HAPPENED TO STOP TURNING OVER THE BOOK
26-495-0082 IN HIM WILL I TRUST SURELY HE SHALL DELIVER THEE FROM THE SNARE OF THE FOWLER AND FROM THE NOISOME PESTILENCE HE SHALL COVER THEE WITH HIS FEATHERS AND UNDER HIS WINGS SHALT THOU TRUST
26-495-0083 BECAUSE THOU HAST MADE THE LORD WHICH IS MY REFUGE EVEN THE MOST HIGH THY HABITATION THERE SHALL NO EVIL BEFALL THEE NEITHER SHALL ANY PLAGUE COME NIGH THY DWELLING
26-495-0085 AND IT WAS MEET HE SHOULD DO WITH ME AS SHOULD SEEM GOOD TO HIM WITH THIS RESOLUTION I WENT TO BED
26-495-0086 THE WOMAN BEING TAKEN ILL WITH WHOM I HAD INTENDED TO ENTRUST MY HOUSE AND ALL MY AFFAIRS
26-495-0088 FOR IF ANY ONE COMPLAINED IT WAS IMMEDIATELY SAID HE HAD THE PLAGUE
26-495-0089 YET BEING VERY ILL BOTH IN MY HEAD AND IN MY STOMACH I WAS NOT WITHOUT APPREHENSION THAT I REALLY WAS INFECTED BUT IN ABOUT THREE DAYS I GREW BETTER THE THIRD NIGHT I RESTED WELL
26-496-0000 IT WAS NOW MID JULY AND THE PLAGUE WHICH HAD CHIEFLY RAGED AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN AND AS I SAID BEFORE IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN
26-496-0001 FOR THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY WITHIN THE WALLS WAS INDIFFERENTLY HEALTHY STILL NOR WAS IT GOT THEN VERY MUCH OVER THE WATER INTO SOUTHWARK
26-496-0003 BUT WE PERCEIVED THE INFECTION KEPT CHIEFLY IN THE OUT PARISHES WHICH BEING VERY POPULOUS AND FULLER ALSO OF POOR THE DISTEMPER FOUND MORE TO PREY UPON THAN IN THE CITY
26-496-0004 YET THERE DIED NO MORE OF THE PLAGUE ON THE WHOLE SOUTHWARK SIDE OF THE WATER THAN SIXTEEN BUT THIS FACE OF THINGS SOON CHANGED
26-496-0006 AND OF THE LAST THE BILL ITSELF SAID
26-496-0007 AND HAVING THE KEY IN MY POCKET I USED TO GO INTO THE HOUSE AND OVER MOST OF THE ROOMS TO SEE THAT ALL WAS WELL FOR THOUGH IT BE SOMETHING WONDERFUL TO TELL
26-496-0009 WERE THEN PRACTISED IN THE TOWN AS OPENLY AS EVER I WILL NOT SAY QUITE AS FREQUENTLY BECAUSE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WERE MANY WAYS LESSENED BUT THE CITY ITSELF BEGAN NOW TO BE VISITED TOO
26-496-0010 MAGISTRATES AND SERVANTS LEFT IN THE CITY AS THEY FLED NOW OUT OF THE CITY SO I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT THE COURT REMOVED EARLY
26-496-0012 AND HARDLY ANYTHING OF REFORMATION THOUGH THEY DID NOT WANT BEING TOLD THAT THEIR CRYING VICES MIGHT WITHOUT BREACH OF CHARITY BE SAID TO HAVE GONE FAR IN BRINGING THAT TERRIBLE JUDGEMENT UPON THE WHOLE NATION
26-496-0013 THAT IF I HAD BEEN A STRANGER AND AT A LOSS FOR MY WAY I MIGHT SOMETIMES HAVE GONE THE LENGTH OF A WHOLE STREET I MEAN OF THE BY STREETS AND SEEN NOBODY TO DIRECT ME
26-496-0015 BECAUSE AS I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD NOT MINGLE WITH ANYBODY THAT CAME OUT OF HOUSES OR
26-496-0016 AS OTHERS RETIRED REALLY FRIGHTED WITH THE DISTEMPER IT WAS A MERE DESOLATING OF SOME OF THE STREETS BUT THE FRIGHT WAS NOT YET NEAR SO GREAT IN THE CITY ABSTRACTLY SO CALLED
26-496-0018 A LITTLE HARDENED IT IS TRUE A VAST MANY PEOPLE FLED AS I HAVE OBSERVED YET THEY WERE CHIEFLY FROM THE WEST END OF THE TOWN AND FROM THAT WE CALL THE HEART OF THE CITY THAT IS TO SAY
26-496-0019 AMONG THE WEALTHIEST OF THE PEOPLE AND SUCH PEOPLE AS WERE UNENCUMBERED WITH TRADES AND BUSINESS BUT OF THE REST THE GENERALITY STAYED AND SEEMED TO ABIDE THE WORST SO THAT
26-496-0021 AND THE ROYAL FAMILY AND THE MONARCHY BEING RESTORED HAD FLOCKED TO LONDON TO SETTLE IN BUSINESS OR TO DEPEND UPON AND ATTEND THE COURT FOR REWARDS OF SERVICES PREFERMENTS AND THE LIKE
26-496-0022 WAS SUCH THAT THE TOWN WAS COMPUTED TO HAVE IN IT ABOVE A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE MORE THAN EVER IT HELD BEFORE NAY SOME TOOK UPON THEM TO SAY IT HAD TWICE AS MANY BECAUSE
26-496-0024 TO LONDON I OFTEN THOUGHT THAT AS JERUSALEM WAS BESIEGED BY THE ROMANS WHEN THE JEWS WERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE PASSOVER BY WHICH MEANS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE SURPRISED THERE
26-496-0025 AS THIS CONFLUX OF THE PEOPLE TO A YOUTHFUL AND GAY COURT MADE A GREAT TRADE IN THE CITY ESPECIALLY IN EVERYTHING THAT BELONGED TO FASHION AND FINERY
27-123349-0000 SOME OF THE SCOTTISH EMIGRANTS HEATED WITH REPUBLICAN ENTHUSIASM AND UTTERLY DESTITUTE OF THE SKILL NECESSARY TO THE CONDUCT OF GREAT AFFAIRS EMPLOYED ALL THEIR INDUSTRY AND INGENUITY
27-123349-0001 BUT HE WAS PLACED UNDER THE CONTROL OF A COMMITTEE
27-123349-0003 AND HE WAS FORCED TO PROMISE THAT EVEN IN THE FIELD EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF A SURPRISE HE WOULD DO NOTHING WITHOUT THE ASSENT OF A COUNCIL OF WAR MONMOUTH WAS TO COMMAND IN ENGLAND HIS SOFT MIND HAD AS USUAL
27-123349-0004 TAKEN AN IMPRESS FROM THE SOCIETY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AMBITIOUS HOPES WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE EXTINGUISHED REVIVED IN HIS BOSOM HE REMEMBERED THE AFFECTION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY GREETED BY THE COMMON PEOPLE IN TOWN AND COUNTRY
27-123349-0006 ENCOURAGING MESSAGES REACHED HIM IN QUICK SUCCESSION FROM LONDON HE WAS ASSURED THAT THE VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WITH WHICH THE ELECTIONS HAD BEEN CARRIED ON HAD DRIVEN THE NATION MAD
27-123349-0007 THAT THE PRUDENCE OF THE LEADING WHIGS HAD WITH DIFFICULTY PREVENTED A SANGUINARY OUTBREAK ON THE DAY OF THE CORONATION AND THAT ALL THE GREAT LORDS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THE EXCLUSION BILL WERE IMPATIENT TO RALLY ROUND HIM
27-123349-0009 ALL THAT WAS REQUIRED OF HIM WAS TO PROMISE THAT HE WOULD NOT ASSUME THE REGAL TITLE
27-123349-0010 IT WAS DETERMINED THAT TWO ENGLISHMEN
27-123349-0012 WHEN GREY REPEATED WITH APPROBATION WHAT WILDMAN HAD SAID ABOUT RICHMOND AND RICHARD THE WELL READ AND THOUGHTFUL SCOT JUSTLY REMARKED THAT THERE WAS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY AND THE SEVENTEENTH
27-123349-0013 RICHMOND WAS ASSURED OF THE SUPPORT OF BARONS EACH OF WHOM COULD BRING AN ARMY OF FEUDAL RETAINERS INTO THE FIELD
27-123349-0015 BUT HIS INTELLECT AND HIS TEMPER PRESERVED HIM FROM THE VIOLENCE OF A PARTISAN HE HAD LIVED ON CONFIDENTIAL TERMS WITH SHAFTESBURY AND HAD THUS INCURRED THE DISPLEASURE OF THE COURT LOCKE'S PRUDENCE HAD HOWEVER
27-123349-0016 BEEN SUCH THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TO LITTLE PURPOSE TO BRING HIM EVEN BEFORE THE CORRUPT AND PARTIAL TRIBUNALS OF THAT AGE IN ONE POINT HOWEVER HE WAS VULNERABLE HE WAS A STUDENT OF CHRIST CHURCH IN THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD
27-123349-0018 TO THE EXCLUSION BILL AND TO THE CHARACTER OF THE EARL OF SHAFTESBURY BUT IN VAIN LOCKE NEITHER BROKE OUT NOR DISSEMBLED BUT MAINTAINED SUCH STEADY SILENCE AND COMPOSURE AS FORCED THE TOOLS OF POWER TO OWN WITH VEXATION
27-123349-0019 THAT NEVER MAN WAS SO COMPLETE A MASTER OF HIS TONGUE AND OF HIS PASSIONS WHEN IT WAS FOUND THAT TREACHERY COULD DO NOTHING ARBITRARY POWER WAS USED AFTER VAINLY TRYING TO INVEIGLE LOCKE INTO A FAULT
27-123349-0021 LOCKE WAS TRAVELLING ON THE CONTINENT FOR HIS HEALTH WHEN HE LEARNED THAT HE HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF HIS HOME AND OF HIS BREAD WITHOUT A TRIAL OR EVEN A NOTICE
27-123349-0022 THE INJUSTICE WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN TREATED WOULD HAVE EXCUSED HIM IF HE HAD RESORTED TO VIOLENT METHODS OF REDRESS BUT HE WAS NOT TO BE BLINDED BY PERSONAL RESENTMENT HE AUGURED NO GOOD FROM THE SCHEMES
27-123349-0024 ALL THE CLANS HOSTILE TO THE NAME OF CAMPBELL WERE SET IN MOTION JOHN MURRAY MARQUESS OF ATHOL
27-123349-0025 AND AT THE HEAD OF A GREAT BODY OF HIS FOLLOWERS
27-123349-0027 THE KING SAID THAT HE HAD RECEIVED FROM UNQUESTIONABLE SOURCES INTELLIGENCE OF DESIGNS WHICH WERE FORMING AGAINST THE THRONE BY HIS BANISHED SUBJECTS IN HOLLAND SOME OF THE EXILES WERE CUTTHROATS
27-123349-0028 WHOM NOTHING BUT THE SPECIAL PROVIDENCE OF GOD HAD PREVENTED FROM COMMITTING A FOUL MURDER AND AMONG THEM WAS THE OWNER OF THE SPOT WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED FOR THE BUTCHERY
27-123349-0030 WERE AT THIS TIME MOST DESIROUS THAT THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR COUNTRY
27-123349-0031 JAMES HAD LATELY HELD LANGUAGE WHICH ENCOURAGED THE HOPE THAT HE WOULD NOT PATIENTLY SUBMIT TO THE ASCENDANCY OF FRANCE IT SEEMED PROBABLE THAT HE WOULD CONSENT TO FORM A CLOSE ALLIANCE WITH THE UNITED PROVINCES AND THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA
27-123349-0033 BUT THE CASE WAS ONE WHICH REQUIRED RAPID AND VIGOROUS ACTION AND THE NATURE OF THE BATAVIAN INSTITUTIONS MADE SUCH ACTION ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE THE UNION OF UTRECHT
27-123349-0034 FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING IMMEDIATE EXIGENCIES HAD NEVER BEEN DELIBERATELY REVISED AND PERFECTED IN A TIME OF TRANQUILLITY EVERY ONE OF THE SEVEN COMMONWEALTHS
27-123349-0036 AS THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES SO THE PROVINCIAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT THE MEANS OF EXACTING PROMPT OBEDIENCE FROM THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES
27-123349-0037 HOLLAND ALONE CONTAINED EIGHTEEN CITIES EACH OF WHICH WAS FOR MANY PURPOSES AN INDEPENDENT STATE JEALOUS OF ALL INTERFERENCE FROM WITHOUT IF THE RULERS OF SUCH A CITY RECEIVED FROM THE HAGUE AN ORDER
27-123349-0039 BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PLACE WHERE THE BRITISH EXILES HAD CONGREGATED AND WHERE THEIR SHIPS HAD BEEN FITTED OUT WAS THE RICH AND POPULOUS AMSTERDAM AND THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM WERE THE HEADS OF THE FACTION HOSTILE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0040 AND TO THE HOUSE OF NASSAU THE NAVAL ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES WAS CONDUCTED BY FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY ONE OF THOSE BOARDS SATE AT AMSTERDAM WAS PARTLY NOMINATED BY THE AUTHORITIES OF THAT CITY
27-123349-0042 THEN INSTEAD OF APPLYING AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE TO THE STATES GENERAL WHO SATE CLOSE TO HIS OWN DOOR
27-123349-0043 WITH A REQUEST THAT THE SUSPECTED SHIPS MIGHT BE DETAINED THE MAGISTRATES OF AMSTERDAM ANSWERED THAT THE ENTRANCE OF THE ZUYDER ZEE WAS OUT OF THEIR JURISDICTION AND REFERRED HIM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS NOTORIOUS THAT THIS WAS A MERE EXCUSE
27-123349-0045 DEPARTED FROM THE COURSE WHICH THEY ORDINARILY OBSERVED IN THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS ON THE SAME DAY ON WHICH HE MADE HIS APPLICATION TO THEM AN ORDER DRAWN IN EXACT CONFORMITY WITH HIS REQUEST
27-123349-0046 WAS DESPATCHED TO THE ADMIRALTY OF AMSTERDAM BUT THIS ORDER IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MISINFORMATION DID NOT CORRECTLY DESCRIBE THE SITUATION OF THE SHIPS THEY WERE SAID TO BE IN THE TEXEL
27-123349-0048 AND ON THE AFTERNOON OF THE SECOND OF MAY HE STOOD OUT TO SEA BEFORE A FAVOURABLE BREEZE THE VOYAGE WAS PROSPEROUS ON THE SIXTH THE ORKNEYS WERE IN SIGHT ARGYLE VERY UNWISELY ANCHORED OFF KIRKWALL
27-123349-0049 AND ALLOWED TWO OF HIS FOLLOWERS TO GO ON SHORE THERE THE BISHOP ORDERED THEM TO BE ARRESTED THE REFUGEES PROCEEDED TO HOLD A LONG AND ANIMATED DEBATE ON THIS MISADVENTURE
27-123349-0051 SOME WERE FOR PROCEEDING WITHOUT DELAY TO ARGYLESHIRE AT LAST THE EARL SEIZED SOME GENTLEMEN WHO LIVED NEAR THE COAST OF THE ISLAND AND PROPOSED TO THE BISHOP AN EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS THE BISHOP RETURNED NO ANSWER AND THE FLEET
27-123349-0052 AFTER LOSING THREE DAYS SAILED AWAY THIS DELAY WAS FULL OF DANGER IT WAS SPEEDILY KNOWN AT EDINBURGH THAT THE REBEL SQUADRON HAD TOUCHED AT THE ORKNEYS TROOPS WERE INSTANTLY PUT IN MOTION
27-123349-0054 THE HERDSMEN AND FISHERMEN WERE INDEED READY TO RALLY ROUND MAC CALLUM MORE BUT OF THE HEADS OF THE CLAN SOME WERE IN CONFINEMENT AND OTHERS HAD FLED THOSE GENTLEMEN WHO REMAINED AT THEIR HOMES WERE EITHER WELL AFFECTED TO THE GOVERNMENT
27-123349-0055 OR AFRAID OF MOVING AND REFUSED EVEN TO SEE THE SON OF THEIR CHIEF FROM DUNSTAFFNAGE THE SMALL ARMAMENT PROCEEDED TO CAMPBELLTOWN NEAR THE SOUTHERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA OF KINTYRE
27-123349-0057 IN THIS PAPER WERE SET FORTH WITH A STRENGTH OF LANGUAGE SOMETIMES APPROACHING TO SCURRILITY MANY REAL AND SOME IMAGINARY GRIEVANCES IT WAS HINTED THAT THE LATE KING HAD DIED BY POISON
27-123349-0058 A CHIEF OBJECT OF THE EXPEDITION WAS DECLARED TO BE THE ENTIRE SUPPRESSION
27-124992-0001 IT TAKES ITS NAME FROM THAT ILLUSTRIOUS WOMAN BY WHOSE VIRTUE AND FORTITUDE AND ARMED WITH PRAYER THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL WERE PRESERVED FROM THE DESTRUCTION THREATENED THEM BY HOLOFERNES AND HIS GREAT ARMY
27-124992-0002 SWORE BY HIS THRONE AND KINGDOM THAT HE WOULD REVENGE HIMSELF OF ALL THOSE COUNTRIES
27-124992-0004 AND ALL THE GOVERNORS AND HIS OFFICERS OF WAR
27-124992-0005 NABUCHODONOSOR THE KING CALLED HOLOFERNES
27-124992-0007 CALLED THE CAPTAINS AND OFFICERS OF THE POWER OF THE ASSYRIANS AND HE MUSTERED MEN FOR THE EXPEDITION AND THE KING COMMANDED HIM A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN ON FOOT AND TWELVE THOUSAND ARCHERS
27-124992-0008 WITH ALL PROVISIONS SUFFICIENT FOR THE ARMIES IN ABUNDANCE AND HERDS OF OXEN AND FLOCKS OF SHEEP
27-124992-0010 HE CAME TO THE GREAT MOUNTAINS OF ANGE
27-124992-0011 AND HE WENT UP TO ALL THEIR CASTLES
27-124992-0013 WHO WERE OVER AGAINST THE FACE OF THE DESERT
27-124992-0014 AND HE FORCED ALL THE STATELY CITIES THAT WERE THERE FROM THE TORRENT OF MAMBRE
27-124992-0016 AND HE SET ALL THE CORN ON FIRE
27-124992-0017 JUDITH CHAPTER THREE
27-124992-0019 MESOPOTAMIA AND SYRIA SOBAL AND LIBYA
27-124992-0020 AND BE SUBJECT TO THEE THAN TO DIE AND TO PERISH
27-124992-0022 AND MADE HIMSELF MASTER OF EVERY CITY
27-124992-0023 THAT THE INHABITANTS OF ALL THE CITIES BOTH PRINCES AND NOBLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE
27-124992-0025 AND ALL APAMEA AND ALL MESOPOTAMIA
27-124992-0026 AND STAYED THERE FOR THIRTY DAYS
27-124992-0028 LEST HE SHOULD DO THE SAME TO JERUSALEM AND TO THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0029 WROTE TO ALL THAT WERE OVER AGAINST ESDRELON
27-124992-0031 AND THEY HUMBLED THEIR SOULS IN FASTINGS AND PRAYERS
27-124992-0032 AND THEY CAUSED THE LITTLE CHILDREN TO LIE PROSTRATE BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD
27-124992-0034 KNOW YE THAT THE LORD WILL HEAR YOUR PRAYERS
27-124992-0035 THAT TRUSTED IN HIS OWN STRENGTH AND IN HIS POWER AND IN HIS ARMY AND IN HIS SHIELDS AND IN HIS CHARIOTS AND IN HIS HORSEMEN NOT BY FIGHTING WITH THE SWORD
27-124992-0037 THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL PREPARED THEMSELVES TO RESIST
27-124992-0038 OR WHAT ARE THEIR CITIES AND OF WHAT SORT AND HOW GREAT ALSO WHAT IS THEIR POWER OR WHAT IS THEIR MULTITUDE
27-124992-0040 ANSWERING SAID IF THOU VOUCHSAFE MY LORD TO HEAR I WILL TELL THE TRUTH IN THY SIGHT CONCERNING THIS PEOPLE THAT DWELLETH IN THE MOUNTAINS
27-124992-0041 WHO ALSO COMMANDED THEM TO DEPART FROM THENCE AND TO DWELL IN CHARAN AND WHEN THERE WAS A FAMINE OVER ALL THE LAND THEY WENT DOWN INTO EGYPT AND THERE FOR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS WERE SO MULTIPLIED
27-124992-0043 AND THE PLAGUE HAD CEASED FROM THEM AND THEY HAD A MIND TO TAKE THEM AGAIN
27-124992-0044 SO THAT THE WATERS WERE MADE TO STAND FIRM AS A WALL ON EITHER SIDE
27-124992-0046 IN WHICH NEVER MAN COULD DWELL
27-124992-0047 AND OF THE HETHITES AND OF THE HEVITES AND OF THE AMORRHITES AND ALL THE MIGHTY ONES IN HESEBON
27-124992-0049 FROM THE DIFFERENT PLACES WHEREIN THEY WERE SCATTERED THEY ARE COME TOGETHER
27-124992-0050 IF THERE BE ANY INIQUITY OF THEIRS IN THE SIGHT OF THEIR GOD LET US GO UP TO THEM BECAUSE THEIR GOD WILL SURELY DELIVER THEM TO THEE
27-124992-0052 WHEN ACHIOR HAD CEASED TO SPEAK THESE WORDS ALL THE GREAT MEN OF HOLOFERNES WERE ANGRY
27-124992-0053 AND HIS ARMIES MEN UNARMED AND WITHOUT FORCE
27-124992-0055 AND BESIDES HIM THERE IS NO OTHER JUDITH CHAPTER SIX
27-124992-0056 WHEN THEY HAD LEFT OFF SPEAKING THAT HOLOFERNES BEING IN A VIOLENT PASSION
27-124992-0058 THEN THOU ALSO SHALT DIE WITH THEM BY THE SWORD OF THE ASSYRIANS
27-124992-0059 AND THEN THE SWORD OF MY SOLDIERS SHALL PASS THROUGH THY SIDES AND THOU SHALT BE STABBED AND FALL AMONG THE WOUNDED OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0061 BEHOLD FROM THIS HOUR THOU SHALT BE ASSOCIATED TO THEIR PEOPLE THAT WHEN THEY SHALL RECEIVE THE PUNISHMENT THEY DESERVE FROM MY SWORD
27-124992-0062 AND TO LEAD HIM TO BETHULIA
27-124992-0064 AND SO LEFT HIM BOUND WITH ROPES
27-124992-0065 AND SETTING HIM IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE ASKED HIM
27-124992-0067 HAD COMMANDED HIM TO BE DELIVERED FOR THIS CAUSE TO THE ISRAELITES THAT WHEN HE SHOULD OVERCOME THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL THEN HE MIGHT COMMAND ACHIOR ALSO HIMSELF TO BE PUT TO DEATH BY DIVERSE TORMENTS FOR HAVING SAID
27-124992-0068 ALL THE PEOPLE FELL UPON THEIR FACES ADORING THE LORD AND ALL OF THEM TOGETHER MOURNING AND WEEPING
27-124992-0070 THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS WHOSE POWER THOU HAST SET FORTH WILL MAKE THIS RETURN TO THEE
27-124992-0071 LET GOD BE WITH THEE ALSO IN THE MIDST OF US THAT AS IT SHALL PLEASE THEE SO THOU WITH ALL THINE
27-124992-0073 AND THEY REFRESHED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
27-124992-0074 AND THEY PRAYED ALL THE NIGHT LONG WITHIN THE CHURCH DESIRING HELP OF THE GOD OF ISRAEL
27-124992-0076 AND TWO AND TWENTY THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE PREPARATIONS OF THOSE MEN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN
27-124992-0077 AND THEY CAME BY THE HILLSIDE TO THE TOP WHICH LOOKETH TOWARD DOTHAIN FROM THE PLACE WHICH IS CALLED BELMA UNTO CHELMON
32-4137-0000 CHAPTER TWO GOING TO THE SOUTH MY COUNTRY SHALL THY HONOURED NAME BE AS A BYE WORD THROUGH THE WORLD ROUSE FOR AS IF TO BLAST THY FAME THIS KEEN REPROACH IS AT THEE HURLED
32-4137-0001 THE BANNER THAT ABOVE THE WAVES IS FLOATING O'ER THREE MILLION SLAVES DICK WALKER THE SLAVE SPECULATOR WHO HAD PURCHASED CURRER AND ALTHESA PUT THEM IN PRISON UNTIL HIS GANG WAS MADE UP
32-4137-0003 SO AS NOT TO WITNESS ANY OF THOSE SCENES SO COMMON WHERE SLAVES ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHEN ABOUT DEPARTING FOR THE SOUTHERN MARKET THIS PLAN WAS SUCCESSFUL FOR NOT EVEN CLOTEL WHO HAD BEEN EVERY DAY AT THE PRISON TO SEE HER MOTHER AND SISTER
32-4137-0004 KNEW OF THEIR DEPARTURE A MARCH OF EIGHT DAYS THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF THE STATE AND THEY ARRIVED ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER WHERE THEY WERE ALL PUT ON BOARD A STEAMER AND THEN SPEEDILY SAILED FOR THE PLACE OF THEIR DESTINATION
32-4137-0006 BUT LIKE MOST WHO MAKE A BUSINESS OF BUYING AND SELLING SLAVES FOR GAIN HE OFTEN BOUGHT SOME WHO WERE FAR ADVANCED IN YEARS AND WOULD ALWAYS TRY TO SELL THEM FOR FIVE OR TEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN THEY ACTUALLY WERE
32-4137-0007 FEW PERSONS CAN ARRIVE AT ANYTHING LIKE THE AGE OF A NEGRO BY MERE OBSERVATION UNLESS THEY ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RACE THEREFORE THE SLAVE TRADER VERY FREQUENTLY CARRIED OUT THIS DECEPTION WITH PERFECT IMPUNITY AFTER THE STEAMER HAD LEFT THE WHARF
32-4137-0009 THEIR GREY HAIR AND WHISKERS AT ONCE PRONOUNCED THEM TO BE ABOVE THE AGES SET DOWN IN THE TRADER'S ADVERTISEMENT
32-4137-0010 AND IF HE DID NOT TAKE DELIGHT IN DISCHARGING HIS DUTY HE DID IT WITH A DEGREE OF ALACRITY SO THAT HE MIGHT RECEIVE THE APPROBATION OF HIS MASTER POMP AS WALKER USUALLY CALLED HIM WAS OF REAL NEGRO BLOOD AND WOULD OFTEN SAY WHEN ALLUDING TO HIMSELF
32-4137-0012 HAD A SET OF TEETH WHICH FOR WHITENESS AND BEAUTY COULD NOT BE SURPASSED HIS EYES LARGE LIPS THICK AND HAIR SHORT AND WOOLLY
32-4137-0013 THAT HE APPEARED PERFECTLY INDIFFERENT TO THE HEARTRENDING SCENES WHICH DAILY OCCURRED IN HIS PRESENCE IT WAS ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE STEAMER'S VOYAGE THAT POMPEY SELECTED FIVE OF THE OLD SLAVES TOOK THEM IN A ROOM BY THEMSELVES AND COMMENCED PREPARING THEM FOR THE MARKET
32-4137-0015 ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO A MAN WHO FROM APPEARANCE WAS NOT LESS THAN FORTY IF I LIVE TO SEE NEXT CORN PLANTING TIME I WILL EITHER BE FORTY FIVE OR FIFTY FIVE I DON'T KNOW WHICH
32-4137-0016 BUT NOW YOU IS ONLY THIRTY YEARS OLD DAT IS WHAT MARSER SAYS YOU IS TO BE I KNOW I IS MORE DEN DAT RESPONDED THE MAN I KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT DAT
32-4137-0018 WELL DEN I GUESS I WILL ONLY BE THIRTY WHEN DEY AXE ME REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0019 ANSWERED THE MAN OH UNCLE JIM IS IT YES DEN YOU MUST HAVE OFF DEM DARE WHISKERS OF YOURS AN WHEN YOU GET TO ORLEANS YOU MUST GREASE DAT FACE AN MAKE IT LOOK SHINEY
32-4137-0021 YOU IS NOW TWENTY THREE YEARS OLD AN NO MORE DUS YOU HEAR DAT YES RESPONDED TOBY
32-4137-0022 AND THEN REPORTED TO HIS MASTER THAT THE OLD BOYS WERE ALL RIGHT AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY THE LIGHTS OF ANOTHER STEAMER WERE SEEN IN THE DISTANCE AND APPARENTLY COMING UP VERY FAST THIS WAS A SIGNAL FOR A GENERAL COMMOTION ON THE PATRIOT
32-4137-0024 AND EACH EXERTING ITSELF TO KEEP THE ASCENDANCY IN POINT OF SPEED THE NIGHT WAS CLEAR THE MOON SHINING BRIGHTLY AND THE BOATS SO NEAR TO EACH OTHER THAT THE PASSENGERS WERE CALLING OUT FROM ONE BOAT TO THE OTHER
32-4137-0025 ON BOARD THE PATRIOT THE FIREMEN WERE USING OIL LARD BUTTER AND EVEN BACON WITH THE WOOD FOR THE PURPOSE OF RAISING THE STEAM TO ITS HIGHEST PITCH THE BLAZE MINGLED WITH THE BLACK SMOKE SHOWED PLAINLY THAT THE OTHER BOAT WAS BURNING MORE THAN WOOD
32-4137-0027 AT THIS MOMENT THE ENGINEER OF THE PATRIOT WAS SEEN TO FASTEN DOWN THE SAFETY VALVE SO THAT NO STEAM SHOULD ESCAPE THIS WAS INDEED A DANGEROUS RESORT
32-4137-0028 THE PATRIOT STOPPED TO TAKE IN PASSENGERS AND STILL NO STEAM WAS PERMITTED TO ESCAPE
32-4137-0030 BY THIS TIME THE BOAT HAD LANDED AND THE COLUMBIA THE OTHER BOAT
32-4137-0031 THE KILLED AND SCALDED NINETEEN IN NUMBER
32-4137-0033 SAID MISTER SMITH AS HE TOOK HIS CARDS ONE BY ONE FROM THE TABLE IN A FEW MOMENTS A FINE LOOKING BRIGHT EYED MULATTO BOY APPARENTLY ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS STANDING BY HIS MASTER'S SIDE AT THE TABLE
32-4137-0034 I WILL SEE YOU AND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BETTER SAID SMITH AS HIS SERVANT JERRY APPROACHED THE TABLE
32-4137-0036 YOU HAVE BEAT ME SAID SMITH AS SOON AS HE SAW THE CARDS JERRY WHO WAS STANDING ON TOP OF THE TABLE WITH THE BANK NOTES AND SILVER DOLLARS ROUND HIS FEET WAS NOW ORDERED TO DESCEND FROM THE TABLE
32-4137-0037 YOU WILL NOT FORGET THAT YOU BELONG TO ME SAID JOHNSON AS THE YOUNG SLAVE WAS STEPPING FROM THE TABLE TO A CHAIR NO SIR REPLIED THE CHATTEL
32-4137-0039 I CLAIM THE RIGHT OF REDEEMING THAT BOY MISTER JOHNSON MY FATHER GAVE HIM TO ME WHEN I CAME OF AGE AND I PROMISED NOT TO PART WITH HIM MOST CERTAINLY SIR THE BOY SHALL BE YOURS WHENEVER YOU HAND ME OVER A COOL THOUSAND REPLIED JOHNSON
32-4137-0040 THE NEXT MORNING AS THE PASSENGERS WERE ASSEMBLING IN THE BREAKFAST SALOONS AND UPON THE GUARDS OF THE VESSEL AND THE SERVANTS WERE SEEN RUNNING ABOUT WAITING UPON OR LOOKING FOR THEIR MASTERS POOR JERRY WAS ENTERING HIS NEW MASTER'S STATEROOM WITH HIS BOOTS
32-4137-0042 WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT I BELONGED TO GOVERNOR LUCAS BUT I UNDERSTAND DAT HE IS BIN GAMBLING ALL NIGHT SO I DON'T KNOW WHO OWNS ME DIS MORNING SUCH IS THE UNCERTAINTY OF A SLAVE'S POSITION
32-4137-0043 HE GOES TO BED AT NIGHT THE PROPERTY OF THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAS LIVED FOR YEARS AND GETS UP IN THE MORNING THE SLAVE OF SOME ONE WHOM HE HAS NEVER SEEN BEFORE
32-4137-0045 TAKING IN FREIGHT AND PASSENGERS WALKER WHO HAD BEEN ON SHORE TO SEE SOME OF HIS OLD CUSTOMERS RETURNED ACCOMPANIED BY A TALL THIN FACED MAN DRESSED IN BLACK WITH A WHITE NECKCLOTH WHICH IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TO BE A CLERGYMAN
32-4137-0046 I WANT A GOOD TRUSTY WOMAN FOR HOUSE SERVICE SAID THE STRANGER AS THEY ENTERED THE CABIN WHERE WALKER'S SLAVES WERE KEPT HERE SHE IS AND NO MISTAKE REPLIED THE TRADER STAND UP CURRER MY GAL HERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WISHES TO SEE IF YOU WILL SUIT HIM
32-4137-0048 I ONLY WANT ONE FOR MY OWN USE AND WOULD NOT NEED ANOTHER SAID THE MAN IN BLACK AS HE AND THE TRADER LEFT THE ROOM WALKER AND THE PARSON WENT INTO THE SALOON TALKED OVER THE MATTER THE BILL OF SALE WAS MADE OUT THE MONEY PAID OVER
32-4137-0049 AND THE CLERGYMAN LEFT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE WOMAN SHOULD BE DELIVERED TO HIM AT HIS HOUSE IT SEEMED AS IF POOR ALTHESA WOULD HAVE WEPT HERSELF TO DEATH FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS AFTER HER MOTHER HAD BEEN TORN FROM HER SIDE BY THE HAND OF THE RUTHLESS TRAFFICKER IN HUMAN FLESH
32-4137-0051 WHICH CAUSED GREAT UNEASINESS TO THE LADIES AND TOOK THE GENTLEMEN TO THAT PART OF THE CABIN HOWEVER NOTHING SERIOUS HAD OCCURRED A MAN AT ONE OF THE TABLES WHERE THEY WERE GAMBLING HAD BEEN SEEN ATTEMPTING TO CONCEAL A CARD IN HIS SLEEVE
32-4137-0052 AND ONE OF THE PARTY SEIZED HIS PISTOL AND FIRED BUT FORTUNATELY THE BARREL OF THE PISTOL WAS KNOCKED UP JUST AS IT WAS ABOUT TO BE DISCHARGED AND THE BALL PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER DECK INSTEAD OF THE MAN'S HEAD AS INTENDED ORDER WAS SOON RESTORED
32-4137-0054 OUR EYES ARE YET ON AFRIC'S SHORES HER THOUSAND WRONGS WE STILL DEPLORE WE SEE THE GRIM SLAVE TRADER THERE WE HEAR HIS FETTERED VICTIM'S PRAYER AND HASTEN TO THE SUFFERER'S AID
32-4137-0055 FORGETFUL OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THE OCEAN PIRATE'S FIEND LIKE FORM SHALL SINK BENEATH THE VENGEANCE STORM HIS HEART OF STEEL SHALL QUAKE BEFORE THE BATTLE DIN AND HAVOC ROAR
32-4137-0057 THE MANTLED TREACHERY OF HIS SOUL O WHERE IS HE WHO HATH SURVEYED THE HORRORS OF OUR OWN SLAVE TRADE THERE IS AN EYE THAT WAKES IN LIGHT THERE IS A HAND OF PEERLESS MIGHT WHICH SOON OR LATE
32-4137-0058 SHALL YET ASSAIL AND REND DISSIMULATION'S VEIL
32-21625-0001 THOSE THAT LIVED THERE THOUGHT THEY HAD EVERY RIGHT TO STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED IT WAS IN THIS VILLAGE THAT BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS NEIGHBORS LIVED IT WAS A DIFFERENT SORT OF TOWN TOO
32-21625-0002 FROM THE ONE WHERE FARMER GREEN WENT EACH WEEK OVER BEYOND BLUE MOUNTAIN ALL THE HOUSES WERE BUILT IN A POND AND ALL THEIR DOORS WERE UNDER WATER BUT NOBODY MINDED THAT BECAUSE LIKE BROWNIE BEAVER
32-21625-0004 SUCH AS POPLARS WILLOWS AND BOX ELDERS THEY HAD DECIDED THAT IT WAS A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE THERE WAS A SMALL STREAM TOO WHICH WAS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF SWIFT RIVER
32-21625-0005 AND BY DAMMING IT THOSE OLD SETTLERS MADE A POND IN WHICH THEY COULD BUILD THEIR HOUSES THEY HAD IDEAS OF THEIR OWN AS TO WHAT A HOUSE SHOULD BE LIKE
32-21625-0007 SHOULD BE FAR BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FOR THEY BELIEVED THAT THAT MADE A HOUSE SAFER TOO TO YOU SUCH AN IDEA MAY SEEM VERY STRANGE BUT IF YOU WERE CHASED BY AN ENEMY YOU MIGHT BE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SWIM UNDER WATER
32-21625-0008 DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF A POND AND SLIP INSIDE A DOOR WHICH LED TO A WINDING HALL
32-21625-0010 WITH WHICH YOU COULD GNAW RIGHT THROUGH A TREE HE WOULD NOT CARE TO HAVE YOU SEIZE HIM AS HE POKED HIS HEAD AROUND A CORNER IN A DARK PASSAGE OF A STRANGE HOUSE IT WAS IN A HOUSE OF THAT KIND THAT BROWNIE BEAVER LIVED
32-21625-0011 AND HE BUILT IT HIMSELF BECAUSE HE SAID HE WOULD RATHER HAVE A NEAT NEW HOUSE THAN ONE OF THE BIG OLD DWELLINGS THAT HAD BEEN BUILT MANY YEARS BEFORE WHEN HIS GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER HAD HELPED THROW THE DAM ACROSS THE STREAM THE DAM WAS THERE STILL
32-21625-0013 YOU SEE THE VILLAGERS KEPT MAKING THE DAM WIDER AND SINCE IT WAS BUILT OF STICKS AND MUD THE WATER SOMETIMES WASHED BITS OF IT AWAY SO IT HAD TO BE KEPT IN REPAIR IF BROWNIE BEAVER AND HIS FRIENDS HAD NEGLECTED THEIR DAM
32-21625-0014 AND WITHOUT ANY WATER TO HIDE THEIR DOORWAYS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE NO LONGER THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NO PLACE EITHER TO STORE THEIR WINTER'S FOOD FOR THEY WERE IN THE HABIT OF CUTTING DOWN TREES AND SAVING THE BARK AND BRANCHES TOO
32-21625-0016 AND SOME OF THE BRANCHES THEY FASTENED UNDER WATER NEAR THE DAM IT WAS JUST LIKE PUTTING GREEN THINGS INTO A REFRIGERATOR SO THEY WILL KEEP NOW YOU SEE WHY BROWNIE BEAVER WOULD NO MORE HAVE THOUGHT OF BUILDING HIS HOUSE ON DRY LAND
32-21625-0017 THAN YOU WOULD THINK OF BUILDING ONE IN A POND EVERYBODY LIKES HIS OWN WAY BEST AND IT NEVER ONCE OCCURRED TO BROWNIE BEAVER THAT HIS WAY WAS THE LEAST BIT STRANGE
32-21631-0001 BROWNIE WAS IN A GREAT HURRY FOR SATURDAY TO ARRIVE IN ORDER TO MAKE NO MISTAKE HE PUT ASIDE A STICK IN WHICH HE GNAWED A NOTCH EACH DAY AND IN THAT WAY HE KNEW EXACTLY WHEN SATURDAY CAME
32-21631-0002 THAT WAS PROBABLY THE LONGEST DAY IN BROWNIE BEAVER'S LIFE AT LEAST IT SEEMED SO TO HIM WHENEVER HE SAW A BIRD SOARING ABOVE THE TREE TOPS HE COULDN'T HELP HOPING IT WAS MISTER CROW
32-21631-0004 HE LIGHTED RIGHT ON TOP OF BROWNIE BEAVER'S HOUSE AND CALLED PAPER DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT BROWNIE HAPPENED TO BE INSIDE HIS HOUSE AND IN A WONDERFULLY SHORT TIME HIS HEAD APPEARED

32-21631-0019 SO I SHALL NOT TELL YOU THE REST UNTIL NEXT SATURDAY YOU SEE YOU HAVE A FEW THINGS TO LEARN ABOUT TAKING A NEWSPAPER
32-21634-0000 THERE WAS GREAT REJOICING IN THE LITTLE VILLAGE IN THE POND WHEN BROWNIE BEAVER RETURNED WITH THE GOOD NEWS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO MORE HUNTING AND FISHING AND WHEN OLD GRANDADDY BEAVER SAID THAT EVERYBODY OUGHT TO TAKE A HOLIDAY TO CELEBRATE THE OCCASION
32-21634-0002 AND BROWNIE BEAVER SAID THAT AFTER THE HOLIDAY WAS OVER HE WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOMEONE BE CHOSEN TO GO DOWN AND THANK FARMER GREEN FOR PUTTING THE NOTICE ON THE TREE THE WHOLE VILLAGE AGREED TO BROWNIE'S PROPOSAL
32-21634-0003 BROWNIE BEAVER HIMSELF PASSED HIS HAT AROUND TO TAKE UP THE VOTES AND IT WAS QUICKLY FOUND THAT EVERY VOTE WAS FOR BROWNIE BEAVER HE HAD EVEN VOTED FOR HIMSELF BUT NO ONE SEEMED TO CARE ABOUT THAT
32-21634-0005 WHERE HE COULD GET AIR WITHOUT BEING SEEN BUT NO ONE COULD PROVE IT SO HE WON THE RACE JUST THE SAME NEXT CAME THE TREE FELLING CONTEST THERE WERE SIX INCLUDING BROWNIE BEAVER THAT TOOK PART IN IT
32-21634-0006 GRANDADDY BEAVER HAD PICKED OUT SIX TREES OF EXACTLY THE SAME SIZE EACH PERSON IN THE CONTEST HAD TO TRY TO BRING HIS TREE TO THE GROUND FIRST AND THAT CAUSED SOME TROUBLE TOO BECAUSE SOME CLAIMED THAT THEIR TREES WERE OF HARDER WOOD THAN OTHERS
32-21634-0008 THAT OLD MISTER CROW HEARD THE NOISE MILES AWAY AND FLEW OVER TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AFTER EVERYBODY CREPT OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE SOME TIME AFTERWARD EVERYONE HAD TO HIDE FOR A WHILE YOU KNOW

32-21634-0017 AND INSTEAD OF HUNTING AND FISHING BEING STOPPED

39-121914-0000 EMMA WOODHOUSE HANDSOME CLEVER AND RICH WITH A COMFORTABLE HOME AND HAPPY DISPOSITION SEEMED TO UNITE SOME OF THE BEST BLESSINGS OF EXISTENCE
39-121914-0001 VERY FOND OF BOTH DAUGHTERS BUT PARTICULARLY OF EMMA
39-121914-0003 THESE WERE THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH THREATENED ALLOY TO HER MANY ENJOYMENTS THE DANGER HOWEVER WAS AT PRESENT SO UNPERCEIVED
39-121914-0004 SORROW CAME A GENTLE SORROW BUT NOT AT ALL IN THE SHAPE OF ANY DISAGREEABLE CONSCIOUSNESS MISS TAYLOR MARRIED IT WAS MISS TAYLOR'S LOSS WHICH FIRST BROUGHT GRIEF
39-121914-0006 THE EVENT HAD EVERY PROMISE OF HAPPINESS FOR HER FRIEND MISTER WESTON WAS A MAN OF UNEXCEPTIONABLE CHARACTER EASY FORTUNE SUITABLE AGE AND PLEASANT MANNERS
39-121914-0007 AND THERE WAS SOME SATISFACTION IN CONSIDERING WITH WHAT SELF DENYING GENEROUS FRIENDSHIP SHE HAD ALWAYS WISHED AND PROMOTED THE MATCH BUT IT WAS A BLACK MORNING'S WORK FOR HER
39-121914-0009 HOW SHE HAD DEVOTED ALL HER POWERS
39-121914-0010 AND HOW NURSED HER THROUGH THE VARIOUS ILLNESSES OF CHILDHOOD A LARGE DEBT OF GRATITUDE WAS OWING HERE BUT THE INTERCOURSE OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE EQUAL FOOTING AND PERFECT UNRESERVE
39-121914-0012 WELL INFORMED USEFUL GENTLE KNOWING ALL THE WAYS OF THE FAMILY INTERESTED IN ALL ITS CONCERNS AND PECULIARLY INTERESTED IN HERSELF IN EVERY PLEASURE EVERY SCHEME OF HERS
39-121914-0013 ONLY HALF A MILE FROM THEM AND A MISS TAYLOR IN THE HOUSE AND WITH ALL HER ADVANTAGES NATURAL AND DOMESTIC SHE WAS NOW IN GREAT DANGER OF SUFFERING FROM INTELLECTUAL SOLITUDE SHE DEARLY LOVED HER FATHER BUT HE WAS NO COMPANION FOR HER
39-121914-0015 FOR HAVING BEEN A VALETUDINARIAN ALL HIS LIFE WITHOUT ACTIVITY OF MIND OR BODY
39-121914-0016 AND THOUGH EVERYWHERE BELOVED FOR THE FRIENDLINESS OF HIS HEART AND HIS AMIABLE TEMPER HIS TALENTS COULD NOT HAVE RECOMMENDED HIM AT ANY TIME HER SISTER THOUGH COMPARATIVELY BUT LITTLE REMOVED BY MATRIMONY
39-121914-0018 THROUGH AT HARTFIELD BEFORE CHRISTMAS BROUGHT THE NEXT VISIT FROM ISABELLA AND HER HUSBAND
39-121914-0019 BUT NOT ONE AMONG THEM WHO COULD BE ACCEPTED IN LIEU OF MISS TAYLOR FOR EVEN HALF A DAY IT WAS A MELANCHOLY CHANGE AND EMMA COULD NOT BUT SIGH OVER IT AND WISH FOR IMPOSSIBLE THINGS TILL HER FATHER AWOKE
39-121914-0021 WHEN HE WAS NOW OBLIGED TO PART WITH MISS TAYLOR TOO AND FROM HIS HABITS OF GENTLE SELFISHNESS AND OF BEING NEVER ABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD FEEL DIFFERENTLY FROM HIMSELF HE WAS VERY MUCH DISPOSED TO THINK MISS TAYLOR HAD DONE
39-121914-0022 AS SAD A THING FOR HERSELF AS FOR THEM AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DEAL HAPPIER IF SHE HAD SPENT ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE AT HARTFIELD EMMA SMILED AND CHATTED AS CHEERFULLY AS SHE COULD TO KEEP HIM FROM SUCH THOUGHTS
39-121914-0024 AND BEAR ALL MY ODD HUMOURS WHEN SHE MIGHT HAVE A HOUSE OF HER OWN A HOUSE OF HER OWN BUT WHERE IS THE ADVANTAGE OF A HOUSE OF HER OWN THIS IS THREE TIMES AS LARGE AND YOU HAVE NEVER ANY ODD HUMOURS MY DEAR
39-121914-0025 YOU KNOW WE HAVE SETTLED ALL THAT ALREADY
39-121914-0027 I AM SURE SHE WILL BE AN EXCELLENT SERVANT
39-121914-0028 HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL HER HOW WE ALL ARE EMMA SPARED NO EXERTIONS TO MAINTAIN THIS HAPPIER FLOW OF IDEAS AND HOPED BY THE HELP OF BACKGAMMON TO GET HER FATHER TOLERABLY THROUGH THE EVENING
39-121914-0030 WAS NOT ONLY A VERY OLD AND INTIMATE FRIEND OF THE FAMILY BUT PARTICULARLY CONNECTED WITH IT AS THE ELDER BROTHER OF ISABELLA'S HUSBAND HE LIVED ABOUT A MILE FROM HIGHBURY
39-121914-0031 WAS A FREQUENT VISITOR AND ALWAYS WELCOME AND AT THIS TIME MORE WELCOME THAN USUAL AS COMING DIRECTLY FROM THEIR MUTUAL CONNEXIONS IN LONDON HE HAD RETURNED TO A LATE DINNER
39-121914-0033 I WISH YOU MAY NOT CATCH COLD DIRTY SIR LOOK AT MY SHOES NOT A SPECK ON THEM
39-121914-0034 I HAVE BEEN IN NO HURRY WITH MY CONGRATULATIONS BUT I HOPE IT ALL WENT OFF TOLERABLY WELL HOW DID YOU ALL BEHAVE WHO CRIED MOST AH POOR MISS TAYLOR TIS A SAD BUSINESS
39-121914-0036 IT MUST BE BETTER TO HAVE ONLY ONE TO PLEASE THAN TWO ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE OF THOSE TWO IS SUCH A FANCIFUL TROUBLESOME CREATURE
39-121914-0037 I AM AFRAID I AM SOMETIMES VERY FANCIFUL AND TROUBLESOME MY DEAREST PAPA
39-121914-0039 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT EMMA SHOULD NOT MISS SUCH A COMPANION SAID MISTER KNIGHTLEY WE SHOULD NOT LIKE HER SO WELL AS WE DO SIR IF WE COULD SUPPOSE IT BUT SHE KNOWS HOW MUCH THE MARRIAGE IS TO MISS TAYLOR'S ADVANTAGE
39-121914-0040 SHE KNOWS HOW VERY ACCEPTABLE IT MUST BE AT MISS TAYLOR'S TIME OF LIFE TO BE SETTLED IN A HOME OF HER OWN AND HOW IMPORTANT TO HER TO BE SECURE OF A COMFORTABLE PROVISION
39-121914-0042 MAY COMFORT ME FOR ANY THING MISTER KNIGHTLEY SHOOK HIS HEAD AT HER HER FATHER FONDLY REPLIED AH MY DEAR I WISH YOU WOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES AND FORETELL THINGS FOR WHATEVER YOU SAY ALWAYS COMES TO PASS
39-121914-0043 AND WHO SEEMED SO PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE WITHOUT A WIFE SO CONSTANTLY OCCUPIED EITHER IN HIS BUSINESS IN TOWN OR AMONG HIS FRIENDS HERE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE WHEREVER HE WENT ALWAYS CHEERFUL
39-121914-0045 AND OTHERS OF THE SON AND THE UNCLE NOT LETTING HIM ALL MANNER OF SOLEMN NONSENSE WAS TALKED ON THE SUBJECT BUT I BELIEVED NONE OF IT EVER SINCE THE DAY ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO
39-121914-0046 AND BORROWED TWO UMBRELLAS FOR US FROM FARMER MITCHELL'S I MADE UP MY MIND ON THE SUBJECT I PLANNED THE MATCH FROM THAT HOUR AND WHEN SUCH SUCCESS HAS BLESSED ME IN THIS INSTANCE DEAR PAPA
39-121914-0048 YOUR MAKING THE MATCH AS YOU CALL IT MEANS ONLY YOUR PLANNING IT YOUR SAYING TO YOURSELF ONE IDLE DAY I THINK IT WOULD BE A VERY GOOD THING FOR MISS TAYLOR IF MISTER WESTON WERE TO MARRY HER
39-121914-0049 AND HAVE YOU NEVER KNOWN THE PLEASURE AND TRIUMPH OF A LUCKY GUESS I PITY YOU I THOUGHT YOU CLEVERER FOR DEPEND UPON IT A LUCKY GUESS IS NEVER MERELY LUCK THERE IS ALWAYS SOME TALENT IN IT
39-121914-0051 UNDERSTANDING BUT IN PART BUT MY DEAR PRAY DO NOT MAKE ANY MORE MATCHES THEY ARE SILLY THINGS AND BREAK UP ONE'S FAMILY CIRCLE GRIEVOUSLY
39-121914-0052 POOR MISTER ELTON YOU LIKE MISTER ELTON PAPA I MUST LOOK ABOUT FOR A WIFE FOR HIM THERE IS NOBODY IN HIGHBURY WHO DESERVES HIM AND HE HAS BEEN HERE A WHOLE YEAR AND HAS FITTED UP HIS HOUSE SO COMFORTABLY
39-121914-0054 AND THIS IS THE ONLY WAY I HAVE OF DOING HIM A SERVICE MISTER ELTON IS A VERY PRETTY YOUNG MAN TO BE SURE AND A VERY GOOD YOUNG MAN AND I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM BUT IF YOU WANT TO SHEW HIM ANY ATTENTION MY DEAR
39-121914-0055 ASK HIM TO COME AND DINE WITH US SOME DAY
39-121915-0000 BUT ON SUCCEEDING EARLY IN LIFE TO A SMALL INDEPENDENCE HAD BECOME INDISPOSED FOR ANY OF THE MORE HOMELY PURSUITS IN WHICH HIS BROTHERS WERE ENGAGED AND HAD SATISFIED AN ACTIVE CHEERFUL MIND
39-121915-0001 AND SOCIAL TEMPER BY ENTERING INTO THE MILITIA OF HIS COUNTY THEN EMBODIED CAPTAIN WESTON WAS A GENERAL FAVOURITE AND WHEN THE CHANCES OF HIS MILITARY LIFE HAD INTRODUCED HIM TO MISS CHURCHILL OF A GREAT YORKSHIRE FAMILY
39-121915-0003 MISS CHURCHILL HOWEVER BEING OF AGE AND WITH THE FULL COMMAND OF HER FORTUNE THOUGH HER FORTUNE BORE NO PROPORTION TO THE FAMILY ESTATE
39-121915-0004 AND IT TOOK PLACE TO THE INFINITE MORTIFICATION OF MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL
39-121915-0006 SHE HAD NOT THE BEST SHE HAD RESOLUTION ENOUGH TO PURSUE HER OWN WILL IN SPITE OF HER BROTHER BUT NOT ENOUGH TO REFRAIN FROM UNREASONABLE REGRETS AT THAT BROTHER'S UNREASONABLE ANGER
39-121915-0007 NOR FROM MISSING THE LUXURIES OF HER FORMER HOME
39-121915-0009 AND MISTER AND MISSUS CHURCHILL HAVING NO CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN NOR ANY OTHER YOUNG CREATURE OF EQUAL KINDRED TO CARE FOR OFFERED TO TAKE THE WHOLE CHARGE OF THE LITTLE FRANK SOON AFTER HER DECEASE
39-121915-0010 AND HE HAD ONLY HIS OWN COMFORT TO SEEK AND HIS OWN SITUATION TO IMPROVE AS HE COULD A COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE BECAME DESIRABLE HE QUITTED THE MILITIA AND ENGAGED IN TRADE
39-121915-0012 WHERE MOST OF HIS LEISURE DAYS WERE SPENT AND BETWEEN USEFUL OCCUPATION AND THE PLEASURES OF SOCIETY THE NEXT EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE PASSED CHEERFULLY AWAY HE HAD BY THAT TIME REALISED AN EASY COMPETENCE
39-121915-0013 ENOUGH TO SECURE THE PURCHASE OF A LITTLE ESTATE ADJOINING HIGHBURY WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS LONGED FOR ENOUGH TO MARRY A WOMAN AS PORTIONLESS EVEN AS MISS TAYLOR
39-121915-0015 TILL THEY WERE ACCOMPLISHED HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BOUGHT HIS HOUSE AND OBTAINED HIS WIFE AND WAS BEGINNING A NEW PERIOD OF EXISTENCE WITH EVERY PROBABILITY OF GREATER HAPPINESS THAN IN ANY YET PASSED THROUGH
39-121915-0016 HE HAD NEVER BEEN AN UNHAPPY MAN HIS OWN TEMPER HAD SECURED HIM FROM THAT EVEN IN HIS FIRST MARRIAGE BUT HIS SECOND MUST SHEW HIM HOW DELIGHTFUL A WELL JUDGING AND TRULY AMIABLE WOMAN COULD BE
39-121915-0018 BUT IT WAS NOT IN MISTER WESTON'S NATURE TO IMAGINE THAT ANY CAPRICE COULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO AFFECT ONE SO DEAR AND AS HE BELIEVED SO DESERVEDLY DEAR HE SAW HIS SON EVERY YEAR IN LONDON AND WAS PROUD OF HIM
39-121915-0019 MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL WAS ONE OF THE BOASTS OF HIGHBURY AND A LIVELY CURIOSITY TO SEE HIM PREVAILED
39-121915-0021 EITHER WHEN MISSUS PERRY DRANK TEA WITH MISSUS AND MISS BATES OR WHEN MISSUS AND MISS BATES RETURNED THE VISIT NOW WAS THE TIME FOR MISTER FRANK CHURCHILL TO COME AMONG THEM AND THE HOPE STRENGTHENED
39-121915-0022 WHEN IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD WRITTEN TO HIS NEW MOTHER ON THE OCCASION FOR A FEW DAYS EVERY MORNING VISIT IN HIGHBURY INCLUDED SOME MENTION OF THE HANDSOME LETTER MISSUS WESTON HAD RECEIVED
39-121915-0024 MISSUS WESTON HAD OF COURSE FORMED A VERY FAVOURABLE IDEA OF THE YOUNG MAN AND SUCH A PLEASING ATTENTION WAS AN IRRESISTIBLE PROOF OF HIS GREAT GOOD SENSE
39-121915-0025 AND EVERY EXPRESSION OF CONGRATULATION WHICH HER MARRIAGE HAD ALREADY SECURED SHE FELT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE WOMAN AND SHE HAD LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW HOW FORTUNATE SHE MIGHT WELL BE THOUGHT
39-121915-0027 AND HAD SENSE AND ENERGY AND SPIRITS THAT MIGHT BE HOPED WOULD BEAR HER WELL AND HAPPILY THROUGH ITS LITTLE DIFFICULTIES AND PRIVATIONS AND THEN THERE WAS SUCH COMFORT IN THE VERY EASY DISTANCE OF RANDALLS FROM HARTFIELD
39-121915-0028 HER SITUATION WAS ALTOGETHER THE SUBJECT OF HOURS OF GRATITUDE TO MISSUS WESTON AND OF MOMENTS ONLY OF REGRET AND HER SATISFACTION HER MORE THAN SATISFACTION HER CHEERFUL ENJOYMENT WAS SO JUST
39-121915-0030 TAYLOR WHEN THEY LEFT HER AT RANDALLS IN THE CENTRE OF EVERY DOMESTIC COMFORT OR SAW HER GO AWAY IN THE EVENING ATTENDED BY HER PLEASANT HUSBAND TO A CARRIAGE OF HER OWN
39-121915-0031 BUT NEVER DID SHE GO WITHOUT MISTER WOODHOUSE'S GIVING A GENTLE SIGH AND SAYING AH POOR MISS TAYLOR SHE WOULD BE VERY GLAD TO STAY
39-121915-0033 BUT STILL THE CAKE WAS EATEN AND THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIS BENEVOLENT NERVES TILL IT WAS ALL GONE
39-121916-0000 MISTER WOODHOUSE WAS FOND OF SOCIETY IN HIS OWN WAY HE LIKED VERY MUCH TO HAVE HIS FRIENDS COME AND SEE HIM AND FROM VARIOUS UNITED CAUSES FROM HIS LONG RESIDENCE AT HARTFIELD AND HIS GOOD NATURE FROM HIS FORTUNE HIS HOUSE AND HIS DAUGHTER
39-121916-0002 AND UNLESS HE FANCIED HIMSELF AT ANY TIME UNEQUAL TO COMPANY THERE WAS SCARCELY AN EVENING IN THE WEEK IN WHICH EMMA COULD NOT MAKE UP A CARD TABLE FOR HIM REAL LONG STANDING REGARD BROUGHT THE WESTONS AND MISTER KNIGHTLEY
39-121916-0003 AND BY MISTER ELTON A YOUNG MAN LIVING ALONE WITHOUT LIKING IT THE PRIVILEGE OF EXCHANGING ANY VACANT EVENING OF HIS OWN BLANK SOLITUDE FOR THE ELEGANCIES AND SOCIETY OF MISTER WOODHOUSE'S DRAWING ROOM
39-121916-0005 FOR A WOMAN NEITHER YOUNG HANDSOME RICH NOR MARRIED MISS BATES STOOD IN THE VERY WORST PREDICAMENT IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING MUCH OF THE PUBLIC FAVOUR AND SHE HAD NO INTELLECTUAL SUPERIORITY TO MAKE ATONEMENT TO HERSELF
39-121916-0006 SHE LOVED EVERY BODY WAS INTERESTED IN EVERY BODY'S HAPPINESS QUICKSIGHTED TO EVERY BODY'S MERITS THOUGHT HERSELF A MOST FORTUNATE CREATURE AND SURROUNDED WITH BLESSINGS IN SUCH AN EXCELLENT MOTHER
39-121916-0008 AND A MINE OF FELICITY TO HERSELF SHE WAS A GREAT TALKER UPON LITTLE MATTERS WHICH EXACTLY SUITED MISTER WOODHOUSE FULL OF TRIVIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND HARMLESS GOSSIP MISSUS GODDARD WAS THE MISTRESS OF A SCHOOL
39-121916-0009 AND WHERE YOUNG LADIES FOR ENORMOUS PAY MIGHT BE SCREWED OUT OF HEALTH AND INTO VANITY BUT A REAL HONEST OLD FASHIONED BOARDING SCHOOL WHERE A REASONABLE QUANTITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE SOLD AT A REASONABLE PRICE
39-121916-0011 HUNG ROUND WITH FANCY WORK WHENEVER SHE COULD AND WIN OR LOSE A FEW SIXPENCES BY HIS FIRESIDE THESE WERE THE LADIES WHOM EMMA FOUND HERSELF VERY FREQUENTLY ABLE TO COLLECT
39-121916-0012 IT WAS NO REMEDY FOR THE ABSENCE OF MISSUS WESTON SHE WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HER FATHER LOOK COMFORTABLE AND VERY MUCH PLEASED WITH HERSELF FOR CONTRIVING THINGS SO WELL
39-121916-0014 TO BE ALLOWED TO BRING MISS SMITH WITH HER A MOST WELCOME REQUEST FOR MISS SMITH WAS A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN WHOM EMMA KNEW VERY WELL BY SIGHT AND HAD LONG FELT AN INTEREST IN ON ACCOUNT OF HER BEAUTY
39-121916-0015 A VERY GRACIOUS INVITATION WAS RETURNED AND THE EVENING NO LONGER DREADED BY THE FAIR MISTRESS OF THE MANSION HARRIET SMITH WAS THE NATURAL DAUGHTER OF SOMEBODY SOMEBODY HAD PLACED HER SEVERAL YEARS BACK AT MISSUS GODDARD'S SCHOOL
39-121916-0017 AND QUITE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE WAS NOT STRUCK BY ANY THING REMARKABLY CLEVER IN MISS SMITH'S CONVERSATION BUT SHE FOUND HER ALTOGETHER VERY ENGAGING NOT INCONVENIENTLY SHY
39-121916-0018 NOT UNWILLING TO TALK AND YET SO FAR FROM PUSHING SHEWING SO PROPER AND BECOMING A DEFERENCE SEEMING SO PLEASANTLY GRATEFUL FOR BEING ADMITTED TO HARTFIELD
39-121916-0020 THOSE SOFT BLUE EYES AND ALL THOSE NATURAL GRACES SHOULD NOT BE WASTED ON THE INFERIOR SOCIETY OF HIGHBURY AND ITS CONNEXIONS THE ACQUAINTANCE SHE HAD ALREADY FORMED WERE UNWORTHY OF HER
39-121916-0021 SHE WOULD FORM HER OPINIONS AND HER MANNERS IT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING AND CERTAINLY A VERY KIND UNDERTAKING HIGHLY BECOMING HER OWN SITUATION IN LIFE HER LEISURE AND POWERS
39-121916-0023 ALWAYS CLOSED SUCH PARTIES AND FOR WHICH SHE HAD BEEN USED TO SIT AND WATCH THE DUE TIME WAS ALL SET OUT AND READY AND MOVED FORWARDS TO THE FIRE BEFORE SHE WAS AWARE WITH AN ALACRITY BEYOND THE COMMON IMPULSE OF A SPIRIT
39-121916-0024 WHICH YET WAS NEVER INDIFFERENT TO THE CREDIT OF DOING EVERY THING WELL AND ATTENTIVELY WITH THE REAL GOOD WILL OF A MIND DELIGHTED WITH ITS OWN IDEAS DID SHE THEN DO ALL THE HONOURS OF THE MEAL
39-121916-0026 AND WHILE HIS HOSPITALITY WOULD HAVE WELCOMED HIS VISITORS TO EVERY THING
39-121916-0027 SUCH ANOTHER SMALL BASIN OF THIN GRUEL AS HIS OWN WAS ALL THAT HE COULD WITH THOROUGH SELF APPROBATION RECOMMEND THOUGH HE MIGHT CONSTRAIN HIMSELF WHILE THE LADIES WERE COMFORTABLY CLEARING THE NICER THINGS TO SAY
39-121916-0029 I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND AN EGG BOILED BY ANY BODY ELSE BUT YOU NEED NOT BE AFRAID THEY ARE VERY SMALL YOU SEE ONE OF OUR SMALL EGGS WILL NOT HURT YOU
39-121916-0030 WHAT SAY YOU TO HALF A GLASS OF WINE A SMALL HALF GLASS PUT INTO A TUMBLER OF WATER I DO NOT THINK IT COULD DISAGREE WITH YOU EMMA ALLOWED HER FATHER TO TALK BUT SUPPLIED HER VISITORS IN A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY STYLE
40-222-0000 CATHERINE WAS COMPLETELY AWAKENED HENRY'S ADDRESS SHORT AS IT HAD BEEN HAD MORE THOROUGHLY OPENED HER EYES TO THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF HER LATE FANCIES THAN ALL THEIR SEVERAL DISAPPOINTMENTS HAD DONE
40-222-0001 MOST BITTERLY DID SHE CRY IT WAS NOT ONLY WITH HERSELF THAT SHE WAS SUNK BUT WITH HENRY HER FOLLY WHICH NOW SEEMED EVEN CRIMINAL WAS ALL EXPOSED TO HIM AND HE MUST DESPISE HER FOREVER
40-222-0003 SHE HATED HERSELF MORE THAN SHE COULD EXPRESS HE HAD SHE THOUGHT HE HAD ONCE OR TWICE BEFORE THIS FATAL MORNING SHOWN SOMETHING LIKE AFFECTION FOR HER BUT NOW
40-222-0004 IN SHORT SHE MADE HERSELF AS MISERABLE AS POSSIBLE FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR WENT DOWN WHEN THE CLOCK STRUCK FIVE WITH A BROKEN HEART AND COULD SCARCELY GIVE AN INTELLIGIBLE ANSWER TO ELEANOR'S INQUIRY IF SHE WAS WELL
40-222-0006 THE EVENING WORE AWAY WITH NO ABATEMENT OF THIS SOOTHING POLITENESS AND HER SPIRITS WERE GRADUALLY RAISED TO A MODEST TRANQUILLITY SHE DID NOT LEARN EITHER TO FORGET OR DEFEND THE PAST
40-222-0007 BUT SHE LEARNED TO HOPE THAT IT WOULD NEVER TRANSPIRE FARTHER AND THAT IT MIGHT NOT COST HER HENRY'S ENTIRE REGARD HER THOUGHTS BEING STILL CHIEFLY FIXED ON WHAT SHE HAD WITH SUCH CAUSELESS TERROR FELT AND DONE NOTHING COULD SHORTLY BE CLEARER
40-222-0009 LONG BEFORE HER QUITTING BATH AND IT SEEMED AS IF THE WHOLE MIGHT BE TRACED TO THE INFLUENCE OF THAT SORT OF READING WHICH SHE HAD THERE INDULGED
40-222-0010 CHARMING AS WERE ALL MISSUS RADCLIFFE'S WORKS AND CHARMING EVEN AS WERE THE WORKS OF ALL HER IMITATORS IT WAS NOT IN THEM PERHAPS THAT HUMAN NATURE AT LEAST IN THE MIDLAND COUNTIES OF ENGLAND WAS TO BE LOOKED FOR
40-222-0012 MURDER WAS NOT TOLERATED SERVANTS WERE NOT SLAVES AND NEITHER POISON NOR SLEEPING POTIONS TO BE PROCURED LIKE RHUBARB FROM EVERY DRUGGIST AMONG THE ALPS AND PYRENEES PERHAPS THERE WERE NO MIXED CHARACTERS
40-222-0013 THERE SUCH AS WERE NOT AS SPOTLESS AS AN ANGEL MIGHT HAVE THE DISPOSITIONS OF A FIEND BUT IN ENGLAND IT WAS NOT SO AMONG THE ENGLISH SHE BELIEVED IN THEIR HEARTS AND HABITS
40-222-0015 AND UPON THIS CONVICTION SHE NEED NOT FEAR TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME ACTUAL SPECKS IN THE CHARACTER OF THEIR FATHER WHO THOUGH CLEARED FROM THE GROSSLY INJURIOUS SUSPICIONS WHICH SHE MUST EVER BLUSH TO HAVE ENTERTAINED SHE DID BELIEVE
40-222-0016 UPON SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO BE NOT PERFECTLY AMIABLE HER MIND MADE UP ON THESE SEVERAL POINTS AND HER RESOLUTION FORMED OF ALWAYS JUDGING AND ACTING IN FUTURE WITH THE GREATEST GOOD SENSE
40-222-0018 AND NOBLENESS OF CONDUCT IN NEVER ALLUDING IN THE SLIGHTEST WAY TO WHAT HAD PASSED WAS OF THE GREATEST ASSISTANCE TO HER AND SOONER THAN SHE COULD HAVE SUPPOSED IT POSSIBLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HER DISTRESS HER SPIRITS BECAME ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE
40-222-0019 AND CAPABLE AS HERETOFORE OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT BY ANYTHING HE SAID THERE WERE STILL SOME SUBJECTS INDEED UNDER WHICH SHE BELIEVED THEY MUST ALWAYS TREMBLE THE MENTION OF A CHEST OR A CABINET FOR INSTANCE
40-222-0021 THE ANXIETIES OF COMMON LIFE BEGAN SOON TO SUCCEED TO THE ALARMS OF ROMANCE HER DESIRE OF HEARING FROM ISABELLA GREW EVERY DAY GREATER SHE WAS QUITE IMPATIENT TO KNOW HOW THE BATH WORLD WENT ON AND HOW THE ROOMS WERE ATTENDED
40-222-0022 AND ESPECIALLY WAS SHE ANXIOUS TO BE ASSURED OF ISABELLA'S HAVING MATCHED SOME FINE NETTING COTTON ON WHICH SHE HAD LEFT HER INTENT AND OF HER CONTINUING ON THE BEST TERMS WITH JAMES
40-222-0024 SHE THANKED HIM AS HEARTILY AS IF HE HAD WRITTEN IT HIMSELF TIS ONLY FROM JAMES HOWEVER AS SHE LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION SHE OPENED IT IT WAS FROM OXFORD AND TO THIS PURPOSE DEAR CATHERINE
40-222-0025 THOUGH GOD KNOWS WITH LITTLE INCLINATION FOR WRITING I THINK IT MY DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING IS AT AN END BETWEEN MISS THORPE AND ME I LEFT HER AND BATH YESTERDAY NEVER TO SEE EITHER AGAIN
40-222-0027 THANK GOD I AM UNDECEIVED IN TIME BUT IT IS A HEAVY BLOW AFTER MY FATHER'S CONSENT HAD BEEN SO KINDLY GIVEN BUT NO MORE OF THIS SHE HAS MADE ME MISERABLE FOREVER
40-222-0028 LET ME SOON HEAR FROM YOU DEAR CATHERINE YOU ARE MY ONLY FRIEND YOUR LOVE I DO BUILD UPON I WISH YOUR VISIT AT NORTHANGER MAY BE OVER BEFORE CAPTAIN TILNEY MAKES HIS ENGAGEMENT KNOWN
40-222-0030 TILL THE VERY LAST IF I REASONED WITH HER SHE DECLARED HERSELF AS MUCH ATTACHED TO ME AS EVER
40-222-0031 I AM ASHAMED TO THINK HOW LONG I BORE WITH IT BUT IF EVER MAN HAD REASON TO BELIEVE HIMSELF LOVED I WAS THAT MAN I CANNOT UNDERSTAND EVEN NOW
40-222-0033 DEAREST CATHERINE BEWARE HOW YOU GIVE YOUR HEART
40-222-0034 AND SHORT EXCLAMATIONS OF SORROWING WONDER DECLARED HER TO BE RECEIVING UNPLEASANT NEWS AND HENRY EARNESTLY WATCHING HER THROUGH THE WHOLE LETTER SAW PLAINLY THAT IT ENDED NO BETTER THAN IT BEGAN HE WAS PREVENTED HOWEVER
40-222-0036 THEN IN HER LAP AND THEN IN HER POCKET AND SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE KNEW NOT WHAT SHE DID THE GENERAL BETWEEN HIS COCOA AND HIS NEWSPAPER HAD LUCKILY NO LEISURE FOR NOTICING HER BUT TO THE OTHER TWO HER DISTRESS WAS EQUALLY VISIBLE
40-222-0037 AS SOON AS SHE DARED LEAVE THE TABLE SHE HURRIED AWAY TO HER OWN ROOM BUT THE HOUSEMAIDS WERE BUSY IN IT AND SHE WAS OBLIGED TO COME DOWN AGAIN SHE TURNED INTO THE DRAWING ROOM FOR PRIVACY BUT HENRY AND ELEANOR HAD LIKEWISE RETREATED THITHER
40-222-0039 AFTER ELEANOR HAD AFFECTIONATELY EXPRESSED A WISH OF BEING OF USE OR COMFORT TO HER AFTER HALF AN HOUR'S FREE INDULGENCE OF GRIEF AND REFLECTION CATHERINE FELT EQUAL TO ENCOUNTERING HER FRIENDS
40-222-0040 SUCH A FRIEND AS ISABELLA HAD BEEN TO HER AND THEN THEIR OWN BROTHER SO CLOSELY CONCERNED IN IT SHE BELIEVED SHE MUST WAIVE THE SUBJECT ALTOGETHER HENRY AND ELEANOR WERE BY THEMSELVES IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM AND EACH AS SHE ENTERED IT
40-222-0042 NO I THANK YOU SIGHING AS SHE SPOKE THEY ARE ALL VERY WELL MY LETTER WAS FROM MY BROTHER AT OXFORD NOTHING FURTHER WAS SAID FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN SPEAKING THROUGH HER TEARS SHE ADDED
40-222-0043 I DO NOT THINK I SHALL EVER WISH FOR A LETTER AGAIN I AM SORRY SAID HENRY CLOSING THE BOOK HE HAD JUST OPENED IF I HAD SUSPECTED THE LETTER OF CONTAINING ANYTHING UNWELCOME I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS
40-222-0045 I HAVE ONE FAVOUR TO BEG SAID CATHERINE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS IN AN AGITATED MANNER THAT IF YOUR BROTHER SHOULD BE COMING HERE YOU WILL GIVE ME NOTICE OF IT THAT I MAY GO AWAY OUR BROTHER FREDERICK YES

40-121026-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE ABBE'S CHAMBER AFTER HAVING PASSED WITH TOLERABLE EASE THROUGH THE SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGE WHICH HOWEVER DID NOT ADMIT OF THEIR HOLDING THEMSELVES ERECT THE TWO FRIENDS REACHED THE FURTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR
40-121026-0001 INTO WHICH THE ABBE'S CELL OPENED FROM THAT POINT THE PASSAGE BECAME MUCH NARROWER AND BARELY PERMITTED ONE TO CREEP THROUGH ON HANDS AND KNEES THE FLOOR OF THE ABBE'S CELL WAS PAVED AND IT HAD BEEN BY RAISING ONE OF THE STONES IN THE MOST OBSCURE CORNER
40-121026-0003 SAID THE ABBE WE HAVE SOME HOURS BEFORE US IT IS NOW JUST A QUARTER PAST TWELVE O'CLOCK INSTINCTIVELY DANTES TURNED ROUND TO OBSERVE BY WHAT WATCH OR CLOCK THE ABBE HAD BEEN ABLE SO ACCURATELY TO SPECIFY THE HOUR
40-121026-0004 LOOK AT THIS RAY OF LIGHT WHICH ENTERS BY MY WINDOW SAID THE ABBE AND THEN OBSERVE THE LINES TRACED ON THE WALL WELL BY MEANS OF THESE LINES WHICH ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOUBLE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE ELLIPSE IT DESCRIBES ROUND THE SUN
40-121026-0006 APPEARED TO HIM PERFECTLY IMPOSSIBLE EACH WORD THAT FELL FROM HIS COMPANION'S LIPS SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH THE MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE AS WORTHY OF DIGGING OUT AS THE GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE MINES OF GUZERAT AND GOLCONDA
40-121026-0007 WHICH HE COULD JUST RECOLLECT HAVING VISITED DURING A VOYAGE MADE IN HIS EARLIEST YOUTH
40-121026-0009 SERVING AS A SAFE DEPOSITORY OF THE ARTICLES MENTIONED TO DANTES
40-121026-0010 ASKED THE ABBE OH YOUR GREAT WORK ON THE MONARCHY OF ITALY

40-121026-0015 NOW LET ME BEHOLD THE CURIOUS PENS WITH WHICH YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR WORK LOOK
40-121026-0016 SHOWING TO THE YOUNG MAN A SLENDER STICK ABOUT SIX INCHES LONG AND MUCH RESEMBLING THE SIZE OF THE HANDLE OF A FINE PAINTING BRUSH TO THE END OF WHICH WAS TIED BY A PIECE OF THREAD
40-121026-0018 ONE COULD CUT AND THRUST DANTES EXAMINED THE VARIOUS ARTICLES SHOWN TO HIM WITH THE SAME ATTENTION THAT HE HAD BESTOWED ON THE CURIOSITIES AND STRANGE TOOLS EXHIBITED IN THE SHOPS AT MARSEILLES
40-121026-0019 AS THE WORKS OF THE SAVAGES IN THE SOUTH SEAS FROM WHENCE THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT BY THE DIFFERENT TRADING VESSELS AS FOR THE INK
40-121026-0021 NIGHT WHY FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE ARE YOUR EYES LIKE CATS THAT YOU CAN SEE TO WORK IN THE DARK INDEED THEY ARE NOT BUT GOD HAS SUPPLIED MAN WITH THE INTELLIGENCE THAT ENABLES HIM TO OVERCOME THE LIMITATIONS OF NATURAL CONDITIONS
40-121026-0022 I FURNISHED MYSELF WITH A LIGHT
40-121026-0024 AND MATCHES I PRETENDED THAT I HAD A DISORDER OF THE SKIN AND ASKED FOR A LITTLE SULPHUR WHICH WAS READILY SUPPLIED DANTES LAID THE DIFFERENT THINGS HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AT ON THE TABLE AND STOOD WITH HIS HEAD DROOPING ON HIS BREAST
40-121026-0025 AS THOUGH OVERWHELMED BY THE PERSEVERANCE AND STRENGTH OF FARIA'S MIND YOU HAVE NOT SEEN ALL YET CONTINUED FARIA FOR I DID NOT THINK IT WISE TO TRUST ALL MY TREASURES IN THE SAME HIDING PLACE LET US SHUT THIS ONE UP
40-121026-0027 WHO SUPPLIED YOU WITH THE MATERIALS FOR MAKING THIS WONDERFUL WORK I TORE UP SEVERAL OF MY SHIRTS AND RIPPED OUT THE SEAMS IN THE SHEETS OF MY BED DURING MY THREE YEARS IMPRISONMENT AT FENESTRELLE
40-121026-0028 SO THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FINISH MY WORK HERE AND WAS IT NOT DISCOVERED THAT YOUR SHEETS WERE UNHEMMED
40-121026-0030 I ONCE THOUGHT CONTINUED FARIA OF REMOVING THESE IRON BARS AND LETTING MYSELF DOWN FROM THE WINDOW WHICH AS YOU SEE IS SOMEWHAT WIDER THAN YOURS ALTHOUGH I SHOULD HAVE ENLARGED IT STILL MORE PREPARATORY TO MY FLIGHT
40-121026-0031 HOWEVER I DISCOVERED THAT I SHOULD MERELY HAVE DROPPED INTO A SORT OF INNER COURT AND I THEREFORE RENOUNCED THE PROJECT ALTOGETHER AS TOO FULL OF RISK AND DANGER NEVERTHELESS I CAREFULLY PRESERVED MY LADDER
40-121026-0033 THAT A PERSON SO INTELLIGENT INGENIOUS AND CLEAR SIGHTED AS THE ABBE MIGHT PROBABLY BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE DARK MYSTERY OF HIS OWN MISFORTUNES WHERE HE HIMSELF COULD SEE NOTHING
40-121026-0034 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF ASKED THE ABBE SMILINGLY IMPUTING THE DEEP ABSTRACTION IN WHICH HIS VISITOR WAS PLUNGED TO THE EXCESS OF HIS AWE AND WONDER I WAS REFLECTING IN THE FIRST PLACE REPLIED DANTES

40-121026-0039 AS YET BUT ONE OF THEM LET ME HEAR THE OTHER IT WAS THIS THAT WHILE YOU HAD RELATED TO ME ALL THE PARTICULARS OF YOUR PAST LIFE YOU WERE PERFECTLY UNACQUAINTED WITH MINE YOUR LIFE MY YOUNG FRIEND HAS NOT BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH
40-121026-0040 I WOULD FAIN FIX THE SOURCE OF IT ON MAN THAT I MAY NO LONGER VENT REPROACHES UPON HEAVEN
40-121026-0042 BUT WHICH CONSISTED ONLY OF THE ACCOUNT OF A VOYAGE TO INDIA AND TWO OR THREE VOYAGES TO THE LEVANT UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE RECITAL OF HIS LAST CRUISE WITH THE DEATH OF CAPTAIN LECLERE AND THE RECEIPT OF A PACKET TO BE DELIVERED BY HIMSELF TO THE GRAND MARSHAL
40-121026-0043 HIS INTERVIEW WITH THAT PERSONAGE AND HIS RECEIVING IN PLACE OF THE PACKET BROUGHT A LETTER ADDRESSED TO A MONSIEUR NOIRTIER HIS ARRIVAL AT MARSEILLES AND INTERVIEW WITH HIS FATHER HIS AFFECTION FOR MERCEDES AND THEIR NUPTUAL FEAST
60-121082-0000 THE EVENING PASSED ON MADAME DE VILLEFORT EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO RETURN TO PARIS WHICH MADAME DANGLARS HAD NOT DARED TO DO NOTWITHSTANDING THE UNEASINESS SHE EXPERIENCED ON HIS WIFE'S REQUEST M DE VILLEFORT
60-121082-0001 WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE THE SIGNAL OF DEPARTURE HE OFFERED A SEAT IN HIS LANDAU TO MADAME DANGLARS THAT SHE MIGHT BE UNDER THE CARE OF HIS WIFE
60-121082-0003 HE HAD NOTICED THE APPROACH OF VILLEFORT TO MADAME DANGLARS AND HE SOON GUESSED ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THOUGH THE WORDS HAD BEEN UTTERED IN SO LOW A VOICE
60-121082-0004 WITHOUT OPPOSING THEIR ARRANGEMENTS HE ALLOWED MORREL CHATEAU RENAUD AND DEBRAY TO LEAVE ON HORSEBACK AND THE LADIES IN M DE VILLEFORT'S CARRIAGE DANGLARS MORE AND MORE DELIGHTED WITH MAJOR CAVALCANTI
60-121082-0006 WAS STANDING ON TIPTOE TO HOLD A LARGE IRON GRAY HORSE ANDREA HAD SPOKEN VERY LITTLE DURING DINNER HE WAS AN INTELLIGENT LAD AND HE FEARED TO UTTER SOME ABSURDITY BEFORE SO MANY GRAND PEOPLE
60-121082-0007 AMONGST WHOM WITH DILATING EYES HE SAW THE KING'S ATTORNEY THEN HE HAD BEEN SEIZED UPON BY DANGLARS WHO WITH A RAPID GLANCE AT THE STIFF NECKED OLD MAJOR AND HIS MODEST SON
60-121082-0009 HE CONTEMPLATED WITH UNSPEAKABLE DELIGHT THE LARGE DIAMOND WHICH SHONE ON THE MAJOR'S LITTLE FINGER FOR THE MAJOR LIKE A PRUDENT MAN IN CASE OF ANY ACCIDENT HAPPENING TO HIS BANK NOTES HAD IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED THEM INTO AN AVAILABLE ASSET
60-121082-0010 THEN AFTER DINNER ON THE PRETEXT OF BUSINESS HE QUESTIONED THE FATHER AND SON UPON THEIR MODE OF LIVING AND THE FATHER AND SON PREVIOUSLY INFORMED THAT IT WAS THROUGH DANGLARS THE ONE WAS TO RECEIVE HIS FORTY EIGHT THOUSAND FRANCS
60-121082-0012 NAY ALMOST THE VENERATION OF DANGLARS FOR CAVALCANTI THE LATTER FAITHFUL TO THE PRINCIPLE OF HORACE NIL ADMIRARI HAD CONTENTED HIMSELF WITH SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE
60-121082-0013 BY DECLARING IN WHAT LAKE THE BEST LAMPREYS WERE CAUGHT THEN HE HAD EATEN SOME WITHOUT SAYING A WORD MORE
60-121082-0015 BY THE SAME MEANS USED BY THE COUNT TO BRING THE LAMPREYS FROM LAKE FUSARO AND THE STERLET FROM THE VOLGA THUS IT WAS WITH MUCH POLITENESS OF MANNER THAT HE HEARD CAVALCANTI PRONOUNCE THESE WORDS
60-121082-0016 TO MORROW SIR I SHALL HAVE THE HONOR OF WAITING UPON YOU ON BUSINESS AND I SIR SAID DANGLARS SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOU
60-121082-0018 AND THAT NOT HAVING COME TOGETHER IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO LEAVE SEPARATELY THE MAJOR SEATED HIMSELF THEREFORE BY THE SIDE OF DANGLARS
60-121082-0019 WHO WAS MORE AND MORE CHARMED WITH THE IDEAS OF ORDER AND ECONOMY WHICH RULED THIS MAN AND YET WHO BEING ABLE TO ALLOW HIS SON SIXTY THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR

60-121082-0024 AND A SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WHICH DISPLAYED A PERFECT SET OF WHITE TEETH POINTED AND SHARP AS THE WOLF'S OR JACKAL'S A RED HANDKERCHIEF ENCIRCLED HIS GRAY HEAD
60-121082-0025 TORN AND FILTHY GARMENTS COVERED HIS LARGE BONY LIMBS WHICH SEEMED AS THOUGH LIKE THOSE OF A SKELETON THEY WOULD RATTLE AS HE WALKED AND THE HAND WITH WHICH HE LEANED UPON THE YOUNG MAN'S SHOULDER
60-121082-0027 OR WAS HE MERELY STRUCK WITH THE HORRIBLE APPEARANCE OF HIS INTERROGATOR WE CANNOT SAY BUT ONLY RELATE THE FACT THAT HE SHUDDERED AND STEPPED BACK SUDDENLY
60-121082-0028 HE ASKED PARDON ME MY FRIEND IF I DISTURB YOU SAID THE MAN WITH THE RED HANDKERCHIEF BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BEG AT NIGHT

60-121082-0084 AS HE HAD HIMSELF OWNED THE REPUTED SON OF MAJOR CAVALCANTI WAS A WILFUL FELLOW HE DREW UP FOR A MINUTE THREW A RAPID GLANCE AROUND HIM AND THEN HIS HAND FELL INSTANTLY INTO HIS POCKET
60-121082-0085 WHERE IT BEGAN PLAYING WITH A PISTOL BUT MEANWHILE
60-121082-0087 THE TWO FRIENDS AS WE SEE WERE WORTHY OF AND UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER ANDREA'S HAND LEFT HIS POCKET INOFFENSIVELY AND WAS CARRIED UP TO THE RED MUSTACHE WHICH IT PLAYED WITH FOR SOME TIME

60-121082-0093 I HOPE I AM NOT THE CAUSE HUSH SAID ANDREA THEY PASSED THE BARRIER WITHOUT ACCIDENT AT THE FIRST CROSS STREET
60-121082-0094 WELL SAID ANDREA
60-121082-0096 AND RUNNING INTO A COURT HE DISAPPEARED ALAS SAID ANDREA SIGHING
78-368-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0002 THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
78-368-0003 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0005 WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
78-368-0006 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0008 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0009 FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
78-368-0011 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0012 BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
78-368-0014 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0017 AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
78-368-0018 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0020 AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
78-368-0021 SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
78-368-0023 MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
78-368-0024 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0026 BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
78-368-0027 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0032 MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
78-368-0033 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0035 REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
78-368-0036 AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
78-368-0038 MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
78-368-0039 AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
78-368-0041 WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
78-368-0042 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0044 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0045 SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
78-368-0047 AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
78-368-0048 I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-368-0053 HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0059 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP
78-369-0060 BUT YOUR DIRECTION WAS NORTHWARDS YOU TOOK ME ON BOARD WHEN MY VIGOUR WAS EXHAUSTED AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK UNDER MY MULTIPLIED HARDSHIPS INTO A DEATH WHICH I STILL DREAD FOR MY TASK IS UNFULFILLED
78-369-0062 SWEAR TO ME WALTON THAT HE SHALL NOT ESCAPE THAT YOU WILL SEEK HIM AND SATISFY MY VENGEANCE IN HIS DEATH AND DO I DARE TO ASK OF YOU TO UNDERTAKE MY PILGRIMAGE TO ENDURE THE HARDSHIPS THAT I HAVE UNDERGONE NO
78-369-0063 SOMETIMES SEIZED WITH SUDDEN AGONY HE COULD NOT CONTINUE HIS TALE AT OTHERS HIS VOICE BROKEN YET PIERCING UTTERED WITH DIFFICULTY THE WORDS SO REPLETE WITH ANGUISH
83-3054-0001 I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
83-3054-0002 I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
83-3054-0004 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0005 FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
83-3054-0007 AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
83-3054-0008 AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
83-3054-0010 BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
83-3054-0011 THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
83-3054-0013 AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
83-3054-0014 WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
83-3054-0016 FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
83-3054-0017 AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
83-3054-0019 HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
83-9960-0000 THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
83-9960-0002 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0003 AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
83-9960-0005 THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
83-9960-0006 THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
83-9960-0008 AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
83-9960-0009 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0011 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0014 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0017 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
83-9960-0020 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0023 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0024 WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0027 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
83-9960-0029 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0032 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0033 THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
83-9960-0035 IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
83-9960-0036 HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
83-9960-0038 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0039 THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
83-9960-0041 THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
83-9960-0042 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0044 READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
83-9960-0045 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0048 MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
83-9960-0050 SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
83-9960-0051 SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
83-9960-0053 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
83-9960-0056 WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
83-11691-0000 THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
83-11691-0002 ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
83-11691-0003 CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
83-11691-0005 THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
83-11691-0006 HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
83-11691-0008 I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
83-11691-0009 I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
83-11691-0011 CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
83-11691-0012 WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
83-11691-0014 SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
83-11691-0015 I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
83-11691-0017 I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
83-11691-0018 AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
83-11691-0020 RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
83-11691-0021 HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
83-11691-0023 I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
83-11691-0024 SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
83-11691-0026 IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
83-11691-0027 AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
83-11691-0029 THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0030 HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
83-11691-0032 CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
83-11691-0033 THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
83-11691-0035 HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
83-11691-0036 THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
83-11691-0038 SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
83-11691-0039 WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
83-11691-0041 SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
83-11691-0042 SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
83-11691-0044 THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
83-11691-0045 BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
87-121553-0001 WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
87-121553-0002 AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
87-121553-0004 TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
87-121553-0005 WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0008 AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
87-121553-0010 DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
87-121553-0011 SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
87-121553-0013 NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
87-121553-0014 HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
87-121553-0016 IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
87-121553-0017 BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
87-121553-0019 WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
87-121553-0020 AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
87-121553-0022 LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
87-121553-0023 THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
87-121553-0025 AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
87-121553-0026 THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
87-121553-0028 WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
87-121553-0029 AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
87-121553-0031 WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
87-121553-0032 AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
87-121553-0034 NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
87-121553-0035 THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
87-121553-0037 AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
87-121553-0038 BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
87-121553-0040 THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
87-121553-0041 FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
87-121553-0043 THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
87-121553-0044 AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
87-121553-0046 THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
87-121553-0047 ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
87-121553-0049 NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
87-121553-0050 NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
87-121553-0052 BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
87-121553-0053 WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
87-121553-0055 EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
87-121553-0056 HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
87-121553-0058 SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
87-121553-0059 BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
87-121553-0061 THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
87-121553-0062 WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
87-121553-0064 SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
87-121553-0065 THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
87-121553-0067 WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
87-121553-0068 BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
87-121553-0070 BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
87-121553-0071 OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
87-121553-0073 THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
87-121553-0074 AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
87-121553-0076 NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
87-121553-0077 WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
87-121553-0079 ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
87-121553-0080 AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
87-121553-0082 I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
87-121553-0083 O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
87-121553-0085 WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
87-121553-0086 AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
87-121553-0088 AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
87-121553-0089 FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
87-121553-0091 BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
87-121553-0092 AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
87-121553-0094 THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
87-121553-0095 IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
87-121553-0097 IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
87-121553-0098 EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
87-121553-0100 AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
87-121553-0101 THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
87-121553-0103 ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
87-121553-0104 I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
87-121553-0106 MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
87-121553-0107 WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
89-218-0001 THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0002 HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
89-218-0004 AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
89-218-0005 PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0007 BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0008 BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
89-218-0010 BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
89-218-0011 AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0013 AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0014 ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0016 CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0017 FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
89-218-0019 WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020 TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0022 ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0023 THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
89-218-0025 MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
89-218-0026 IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
89-218-0028 YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0029 AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-218-0031 SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
89-218-0032 AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0034 A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
89-218-0035 AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0037 IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
89-218-0038 BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
89-218-0040 ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
89-218-0041 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0043 AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044 AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0046 HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0047 AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
89-218-0049 SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
89-218-0050 AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0052 A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0053 STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
89-218-0055 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0056 BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
89-219-0000 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001 SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0003 IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0006 FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010 AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0012 BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013 MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0015 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016 HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0018 SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019 OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0021 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0024 HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0030 CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0033 AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0036 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037 THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0042 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043 HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0045 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046 SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0048 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049 AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0051 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052 ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0054 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0057 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058 HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0063 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064 THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
103-1240-0001 THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
103-1240-0002 FOR NOT EVEN A BROOK COULD RUN PAST MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE'S DOOR WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR DECENCY AND DECORUM IT PROBABLY WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MISSUS RACHEL WAS SITTING AT HER WINDOW KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON EVERYTHING THAT PASSED FROM BROOKS AND CHILDREN UP
103-1240-0004 BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
103-1240-0005 HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
103-1240-0007 ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
103-1240-0008 THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
103-1240-0010 PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
103-1240-0011 AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
103-1240-0013 HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
103-1240-0014 AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
103-1240-0016 YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
103-1240-0017 THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
103-1240-0019 BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
103-1240-0020 BORDERED WITH WILD ROSE BUSHES IT'S NO WONDER MATTHEW AND MARILLA ARE BOTH A LITTLE ODD LIVING AWAY BACK HERE BY THEMSELVES TREES AREN'T MUCH COMPANY THOUGH DEAR KNOWS IF THEY WERE THERE'D BE ENOUGH OF THEM I'D RUTHER LOOK AT PEOPLE TO BE SURE
103-1240-0022 SET ABOUT ON ONE SIDE WITH GREAT PATRIARCHAL WILLOWS AND THE OTHER WITH PRIM LOMBARDIES NOT A STRAY STICK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN FOR MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF THERE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY SHE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT MARILLA CUTHBERT SWEPT THAT YARD OVER AS OFTEN AS SHE SWEPT HER HOUSE
103-1240-0023 ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
103-1240-0025 WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
103-1240-0026 AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
103-1240-0028 YET WHAT OF MATTHEW'S WHITE COLLAR AND THE SORREL MARE MISSUS RACHEL WAS GETTING FAIRLY DIZZY WITH THIS UNUSUAL MYSTERY ABOUT QUIET UNMYSTERIOUS GREEN GABLES GOOD EVENING RACHEL MARILLA SAID BRISKLY THIS IS A REAL FINE EVENING ISN'T IT WON'T YOU SIT DOWN
103-1240-0029 HOW ARE ALL YOUR FOLKS SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT BE CALLED FRIENDSHIP EXISTED AND ALWAYS HAD EXISTED BETWEEN MARILLA CUTHBERT AND MISSUS RACHEL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISSIMILARITY MARILLA WAS A TALL
103-1240-0031 BUT THERE WAS A SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOUTH WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY DEVELOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR WE'RE ALL PRETTY WELL SAID MISSUS RACHEL I WAS KIND OF AFRAID YOU WEREN'T THOUGH WHEN I SAW MATTHEW STARTING OFF TODAY I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S
103-1240-0032 MARILLA'S LIPS TWITCHED UNDERSTANDINGLY SHE HAD EXPECTED MISSUS RACHEL UP SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THE SIGHT OF MATTHEW JAUNTING OFF SO UNACCOUNTABLY WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER NEIGHBOR'S CURIOSITY OH NO I'M QUITE WELL ALTHOUGH I HAD A BAD HEADACHE YESTERDAY SHE SAID
103-1240-0034 SHE WAS ACTUALLY STRICKEN DUMB FOR FIVE SECONDS IT WAS UNSUPPOSABLE THAT MARILLA WAS MAKING FUN OF HER BUT MISSUS RACHEL WAS ALMOST FORCED TO SUPPOSE IT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MARILLA SHE DEMANDED WHEN VOICE RETURNED TO HER YES OF COURSE
103-1240-0035 SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
103-1240-0037 WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
103-1240-0038 MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
103-1240-0040 THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
103-1240-0041 THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
103-1240-0043 OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF SOME USE IN DOING CHORES RIGHT OFF AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE TRAINED UP PROPER WE MEAN TO GIVE HIM A GOOD HOME AND SCHOOLING WE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER TODAY THE MAIL MAN BROUGHT IT FROM THE STATION SAYING THEY WERE COMING ON THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN TONIGHT
103-1240-0044 SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
103-1240-0046 NOR HOW HE'S LIKELY TO TURN OUT WHY IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK I READ IN THE PAPER HOW A MAN AND HIS WIFE UP WEST OF THE ISLAND TOOK A BOY OUT OF AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND HE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SET IT ON PURPOSE MARILLA AND NEARLY BURNT THEM TO A CRISP IN THEIR BEDS
103-1240-0047 AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
103-1240-0049 IT'S SO SELDOM MATTHEW SETS HIS MIND ON ANYTHING THAT WHEN HE DOES I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO GIVE IN AND AS FOR THE RISK THERE'S RISKS IN PRETTY NEAR EVERYTHING A BODY DOES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S RISKS IN PEOPLE'S HAVING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN IF IT COMES TO THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT WELL
103-1240-0050 AND THEN NOVA SCOTIA IS RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ISLAND IT ISN'T AS IF WE WERE GETTING HIM FROM ENGLAND OR THE STATES HE CAN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES WELL I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN A TONE THAT PLAINLY INDICATED HER PAINFUL DOUBTS
103-1240-0052 AS IF POISONING WELLS WERE A PURELY FEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND NOT TO BE DREADED IN THE CASE OF A BOY I'D NEVER DREAM OF TAKING A GIRL TO BRING UP I WONDER AT MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER FOR DOING IT BUT THERE SHE WOULDN'T SHRINK FROM ADOPTING A WHOLE ORPHAN ASYLUM IF SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD
103-1240-0053 MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
103-1240-0055 IT DOES REALLY SEEM AS IF I MUST BE DREAMING WELL I'M SORRY FOR THAT POOR YOUNG ONE AND NO MISTAKE MATTHEW AND MARILLA DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHILDREN AND THEY'LL EXPECT HIM TO BE WISER AND STEADIER THAT HIS OWN GRANDFATHER
103-1240-0056 IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
103-1241-0000 CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
103-1241-0001 OR A HOLLOW WHERE WILD PLUMS HUNG OUT THEIR FILMY BLOOM THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE BREATH OF MANY APPLE ORCHARDS AND THE MEADOWS SLOPED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO HORIZON MISTS OF PEARL AND PURPLE WHILE THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG AS IF IT WERE THE ONE DAY OF SUMMER IN ALL THE YEAR
103-1241-0003 HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES WERE SECRETLY LAUGHING AT HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THINKING SO FOR HE WAS AN ODD LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH AN UNGAINLY FIGURE AND LONG IRON GRAY HAIR THAT TOUCHED HIS STOOPING SHOULDERS
103-1241-0004 AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
103-1241-0006 MATTHEW BARELY NOTING THAT IT WAS A GIRL SIDLED PAST HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER HAD HE LOOKED HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE TENSE RIGIDITY AND EXPECTATION OF HER ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION SHE WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY
103-1241-0007 AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
103-1241-0009 SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
103-1241-0010 GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0012 MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
103-1241-0013 AND DEMAND OF HER WHY SHE WASN'T A BOY MATTHEW GROANED IN SPIRIT AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SHUFFLED GENTLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS HER SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD PASSED HER AND SHE HAD HER EYES ON HIM NOW MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
103-1241-0015 HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
103-1241-0016 MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
103-1241-0018 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MISTER MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF GREEN GABLES SHE SAID IN A PECULIARLY CLEAR SWEET VOICE I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING FOR ME
103-1241-0019 I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
103-1241-0021 MATTHEW HAD TAKEN THE SCRAWNY LITTLE HAND AWKWARDLY IN HIS THEN AND THERE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO HE COULD NOT TELL THIS CHILD WITH THE GLOWING EYES THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HE WOULD TAKE HER HOME AND LET MARILLA DO THAT SHE COULDN'T BE LEFT AT BRIGHT RIVER ANYHOW
103-1241-0022 NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE SO ALL QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS MIGHT AS WELL BE DEFERRED UNTIL HE WAS SAFELY BACK AT GREEN GABLES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE HE SAID SHYLY COME ALONG THE HORSE IS OVER IN THE YARD GIVE ME YOUR BAG OH I CAN CARRY IT THE CHILD RESPONDED CHEERFULLY
103-1241-0024 WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0025 IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
103-1241-0027 WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
103-1241-0028 I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
103-1241-0030 ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
103-1241-0031 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
103-1241-0033 I CAN IMAGINE THAT I'M DRESSED GORGEOUSLY THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE ASYLUM I FELT SO ASHAMED BECAUSE I HAD TO WEAR THIS HORRID OLD WINCEY DRESS ALL THE ORPHANS HAD TO WEAR THEM YOU KNOW A MERCHANT IN HOPETON LAST WINTER DONATED THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF WINCEY TO THE ASYLUM SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SELL IT
103-1241-0034 BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
103-1241-0036 SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
103-1241-0037 OH THERE ARE A LOT MORE CHERRY TREES ALL IN BLOOM THIS ISLAND IS THE BLOOMIEST PLACE I JUST LOVE IT ALREADY AND I'M SO GLAD I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND WAS THE PRETTIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
103-1241-0039 AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND FOR PITY'S SAKE NOT TO ASK HER ANY MORE QUESTIONS SHE SAID I MUST HAVE ASKED HER A THOUSAND ALREADY I SUPPOSE I HAD TOO BUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WHAT DOES MAKE THE ROADS RED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW
103-1241-0040 THERE'D BE NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION THEN WOULD THERE BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME I DO WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T TALK IF YOU SAY SO I'LL STOP I CAN STOP WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND TO IT ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT MATTHEW
103-1241-0042 HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
103-1241-0043 AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS

118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS

118-124588-0000 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0003 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0006 PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
118-124588-0007 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0009 FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
118-124588-0010 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0012 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0016 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0018 WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
118-124588-0019 FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH

125-121124-0002 HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
125-121124-0003 AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY

125-121124-0009 A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT IN OUR STORY AS IN THE WORLD HE OCCUPIED ONE OF THOSE BEINGS DESIGNED FROM THEIR BIRTH TO MAKE THEMSELVES USEFUL TO OTHERS HE WAS PUNCTUAL DRESSED IN BLACK WITH CRAPE AROUND HIS HAT
125-121124-0011 EQUALLY PLEASED TO WITNESS THE FESTIVITIES OR THE MOURNING OF THE RICH AND WHO RUSH WITH THE SAME AVIDITY TO A FUNERAL PROCESSION AS TO THE MARRIAGE OF A DUCHESS GRADUALLY THE RECEPTION ROOM FILLED
125-121124-0012 AND SOME OF OUR OLD FRIENDS MADE THEIR APPEARANCE WE MEAN DEBRAY
125-121124-0014 LESS OWING TO HIS SOCIAL POSITION THAN TO HIS PERSONAL MERIT THE COUSIN STANDING AT THE DOOR USHERED IN THE GUESTS AND IT WAS RATHER A RELIEF TO THE INDIFFERENT TO SEE A PERSON AS UNMOVED AS THEMSELVES
125-121124-0015 AND WHO DID NOT EXACT A MOURNFUL FACE OR FORCE TEARS AS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE CASE WITH A FATHER A BROTHER OR A LOVER

125-121342-0004 THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
125-121342-0006 CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
125-121342-0007 THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
125-121342-0009 A GREAT SWARM OF TIRED MAGPIE GIRLS FROM A DEPARTMENT STORE CROWDED ALONG WITH SHRIEKS OF STRIDENT LAUGHTER THREE TO AN UMBRELLA A SQUAD OF MARCHING POLICEMEN PASSED ALREADY MIRACULOUSLY PROTECTED BY OILSKIN CAPES THE RAIN GAVE AMORY A FEELING OF DETACHMENT
125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0012 AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
125-121342-0013 AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
125-121342-0015 IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
125-121342-0016 AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
125-121342-0018 AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
125-121342-0019 HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
125-121342-0021 MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS
125-121342-0022 SOMEWHERE IN HIS MIND A CONVERSATION BEGAN RATHER RESUMED ITS PLACE IN HIS ATTENTION IT WAS COMPOSED NOT OF TWO VOICES BUT OF ONE WHICH ACTED ALIKE AS QUESTIONER AND ANSWERER QUESTION WELL WHAT'S THE SITUATION ANSWER
125-121342-0024 I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT BEING ABLE TO
125-121342-0025 REALLY THEY ARE THE ONLY THINGS I CAN DO QUESTION BE DEFINITE
125-121342-0027 NO I AM MERELY AFRAID OF BEING POOR QUESTION VERY AFRAID
125-121342-0028 JUST PASSIVELY AFRAID QUESTION
125-121342-0030 RATHER I DON'T WANT TO COMMIT MORAL SUICIDE QUESTION HAVE YOU NO INTERESTS LEFT
125-121342-0031 NONE I'VE NO MORE VIRTUE TO LOSE JUST AS A COOLING POT GIVES OFF HEAT SO ALL THROUGH YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE WE GIVE OFF CALORIES OF VIRTUE THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED INGENUOUSNESS QUESTION AN INTERESTING IDEA
125-121342-0033 THEY'RE WARMING THEMSELVES AT HER VIRTUE BUT SARAH SEES THE SIMPER AND NEVER MAKES THAT REMARK AGAIN ONLY SHE FEELS A LITTLE COLDER AFTER THAT QUESTION ALL YOUR CALORIES GONE
125-121342-0034 ALL OF THEM I'M BEGINNING TO WARM MYSELF AT OTHER PEOPLE'S VIRTUE QUESTION ARE YOU CORRUPT
125-121342-0036 NOT NECESSARILY QUESTION WHAT WOULD BE THE TEST OF CORRUPTION
125-121342-0037 BECOMING REALLY INSINCERE CALLING MYSELF NOT SUCH A BAD FELLOW THINKING I REGRETTED MY LOST YOUTH WHEN I ONLY ENVY THE DELIGHTS OF LOSING IT
125-121342-0039 THIS DIALOGUE MERGED GROTESQUELY INTO HIS MIND'S MOST FAMILIAR STATE A GROTESQUE BLENDING OF DESIRES WORRIES EXTERIOR IMPRESSIONS AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVENTH STREET OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SEVENTH STREET
125-121342-0040 TWO AND THREE LOOK ALIKE NO NOT MUCH SEAT DAMP ARE CLOTHES ABSORBING WETNESS FROM SEAT OR SEAT ABSORBING DRYNESS FROM CLOTHES SITTING ON WET SUBSTANCE GAVE APPENDICITIS SO FROGGY PARKER'S MOTHER SAID WELL HE'D HAD IT
125-121342-0042 IF IT WASN'T APPENDICITIS INFLUENZA MAYBE WHAT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTIETH STREET
125-121342-0043 ONE O TWO INSTEAD OF ONE TWO SEVEN ROSALIND NOT LIKE BEATRICE ELEANOR LIKE BEATRICE ONLY WILDER AND BRAINIER APARTMENTS ALONG HERE EXPENSIVE PROBABLY HUNDRED AND FIFTY A MONTH MAYBE TWO HUNDRED
125-121342-0045 WANT TO GO DOWN THERE AND SEE IF IT'S DIRTY FRENCH RIVERS ALL BROWN OR BLACK SO WERE SOUTHERN RIVERS TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS MEANT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOUGHNUTS HE COULD LIVE ON IT THREE MONTHS AND SLEEP IN THE PARK WONDER WHERE JILL WAS JILL BAYNE FAYNE
125-121342-0046 SAYNE WHAT THE DEVIL NECK HURTS DARNED UNCOMFORTABLE SEAT NO DESIRE TO SLEEP WITH JILL WHAT COULD ALEC SEE IN HER
125-121342-0048 WONDER WHAT HUMBIRD'S BODY LOOKED LIKE NOW IF HE HIMSELF HADN'T BEEN BAYONET INSTRUCTOR HE'D HAVE GONE UP TO LINE THREE MONTHS SOONER PROBABLY BEEN KILLED WHERE'S THE DARNED BELL
150-126107-0000 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0002 BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
150-126107-0003 HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
150-126107-0005 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0008 AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
150-126107-0009 SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
150-126107-0011 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0017 WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
150-126107-0018 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0020 FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
150-126107-0021 NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
150-126107-0023 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0024 VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
150-126107-0027 DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
150-126107-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
150-126107-0030 AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126107-0032 THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
150-126107-0033 AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0038 AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
150-126107-0039 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126112-0000 THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0003 IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
150-126112-0004 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0006 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0009 AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
150-126112-0010 THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
150-126112-0012 AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
150-126112-0013 REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0018 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0021 I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0024 YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
150-126112-0025 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0027 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0030 LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
150-126112-0031 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0033 BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
150-126112-0034 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0036 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
150-132655-0000 BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
150-132655-0002 THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
150-132655-0003 IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
150-132655-0005 HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0008 IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
150-132655-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
150-132655-0011 THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
150-132655-0012 THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
150-132655-0014 AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
150-132655-0015 MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
150-132655-0017 WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
150-132655-0018 AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0021 I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
150-132655-0023 YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
150-132655-0024 MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
150-132655-0026 KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
150-132655-0027 ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
150-132655-0029 THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
150-132655-0030 LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
150-132655-0032 THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
150-132655-0033 FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
150-132655-0035 IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
163-121908-0000 SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
163-121908-0002 WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
163-121908-0003 ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
163-121908-0005 FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
163-121908-0006 EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
163-121908-0008 NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
163-121908-0009 BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
163-121908-0011 SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
163-121908-0012 DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
163-122947-0001 OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
163-122947-0002 AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
163-122947-0004 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0005 IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
163-122947-0007 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0010 IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
163-122947-0011 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0013 LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
163-122947-0014 FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
163-122947-0016 I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
163-122947-0017 SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0022 IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
163-122947-0023 GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
163-122947-0025 THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0028 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0031 AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
163-122947-0032 SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0034 MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
163-122947-0035 THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
163-122947-0037 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0043 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0046 AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0049 THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
163-122947-0050 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0052 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0053 AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
163-122947-0055 WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
163-122947-0056 ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
163-122947-0058 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0061 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0065 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0067 OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0070 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0073 THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
163-122947-0074 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0076 APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
163-122947-0077 SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
163-122947-0079 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0080 AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0083 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0085 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0086 THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
163-122947-0088 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0089 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
163-122947-0091 INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
163-122947-0092 JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
163-122947-0094 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
163-122947-0097 OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
163-122947-0098 I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
196-122150-0001 HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
196-122150-0002 THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
196-122150-0004 THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
196-122150-0005 THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
196-122150-0007 AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
196-122150-0008 HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
196-122150-0010 HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
196-122150-0011 AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
196-122150-0013 BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
196-122150-0014 JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
196-122150-0016 HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
196-122150-0017 HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
196-122150-0019 HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
196-122150-0020 THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
196-122150-0022 SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
196-122150-0023 BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
196-122150-0025 AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
196-122150-0026 LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
196-122150-0028 MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
196-122150-0029 THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
196-122150-0031 THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
196-122150-0032 SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
196-122150-0034 ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
196-122150-0035 ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
196-122150-0037 GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
196-122150-0038 THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
196-122150-0040 HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0002 THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
196-122152-0003 AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
196-122152-0005 OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0006 CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
196-122152-0008 LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0009 I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
196-122152-0011 I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
196-122152-0012 TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
196-122152-0014 STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
196-122152-0015 WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
196-122152-0017 THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
196-122152-0018 PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
196-122152-0020 HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0023 HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
196-122152-0024 AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
196-122159-0002 LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
196-122159-0004 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
196-122159-0005 THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
196-122159-0007 GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
196-122159-0008 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
196-122159-0010 HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
196-122159-0011 HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
196-122159-0013 AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
196-122159-0014 HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
196-122159-0016 BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
196-122159-0017 HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
196-122159-0019 I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
196-122159-0020 HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
196-122159-0022 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
196-122159-0023 MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
196-122159-0025 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0026 KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
196-122159-0028 NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
196-122159-0029 I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
196-122159-0031 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
196-122159-0032 NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
198-209-0001 CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
198-209-0002 AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
198-209-0004 AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
198-209-0005 AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
198-209-0007 CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
198-209-0008 TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
198-209-0010 TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
198-209-0011 ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
198-209-0013 HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
198-209-0014 AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
198-209-0016 OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
198-209-0017 AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
198-209-0019 MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
198-209-0020 AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
198-209-0022 I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
198-209-0023 AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
198-209-0025 AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
198-209-0026 AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
198-209-0028 NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
198-209-0029 AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
198-209-0031 WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
198-209-0032 WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
198-209-0034 WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
198-209-0035 IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
198-209-0037 THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
198-209-0038 LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
198-126831-0001 SHE WAS IN TURN AN ORIENTAL PRINCESS BEHIND A SILKEN VEIL THE BRIDE WHO FOLLOWED HER BRIDEGROOM TO THE WARS OF PALESTINE DISGUISED AS A PAGE THE GALLANT LADY WHO RANSOMED HER DIAMOND NECKLACE BY DANCING A CORANTO
198-126831-0002 WITH A HIGHWAYMAN ON A MOONLIT HEATH AND BUSKIRK'S GIRL WHO JOINED THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF TEMPERANCE JUST TO SEE WHAT WAS INTO IT AND IN EACH IMPERSONATION SHE WAS SO THOROUGHLY THE THING IMPERSONATED
198-126831-0004 CHANCING ACCIDENTALLY I VOW TO OVERHEAR CERTAIN OF THESE SECRETS I LEARNED THAT SARA RAY HAD NAMED AN APPLE FOR JOHNNY PRICE AND CECILY TRUE'S YOU LIVE THERE WAS EIGHT SEEDS IN IT AND YOU KNOW EIGHT MEANS THEY BOTH LOVE
198-126831-0005 WHILE CECILY ADMITTED THAT WILLY FRASER HAD WRITTEN ON HIS SLATE AND SHOWED IT TO HER IF YOU LOVE ME AS I LOVE YOU NO KNIFE CAN CUT OUR LOVE IN TWO BUT SARA RAY NEVER YOU BREATHE THIS TO A LIVING SOUL
198-126831-0007 AND BEING INTOLERABLY CONCEITED ABOUT IT UNTIL SARA RAY CURED HIM BY CALLING HIM A DEAR SWEET CAT AND KISSING HIM BETWEEN THE EARS THEN PAT SNEAKED ABJECTLY OFF HIS TAIL DROOPING
198-126831-0008 VERY FEW CATS HAVE AND MOST OF THEM HAVE SUCH AN INORDINATE APPETITE FOR FLATTERY THAT THEY WILL SWALLOW ANY AMOUNT OF IT AND THRIVE THEREON PADDY HAD A FINER TASTE THE STORY GIRL AND I WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO COULD PAY HIM COMPLIMENTS TO HIS LIKING
198-126831-0010 PAT YOU'VE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN ANY HUMAN BEING EVER KNEW AND I VOW PADDY WOULD LICK HIS CHOPS WITH DELIGHT BUT TO BE CALLED A SWEET CAT OH SARA SARA
198-126831-0011 FELICITY TRIED AND HAD THE MOST GRATIFYING LUCK WITH A NEW AND COMPLICATED CAKE RECIPE A GORGEOUS COMPOUND
198-126831-0013 THE POOR MAN MEANT IT AS A COMPLIMENT BUT FELICITY WHO KNEW UNCLE BLAIR WAS AN ARTIST AND HAD A POOR OPINION OF SUCH FRY LOOKED INDIGNANT AND RETORTED INDEED SHE WASN'T
198-126831-0014 I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
198-126831-0016 A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
198-126831-0017 THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
198-126831-0019 I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
198-126831-0020 ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
198-126831-0022 THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
198-126831-0023 AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
198-126831-0025 YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0026 IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
198-126831-0028 AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
198-126831-0029 AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
198-126831-0031 WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
198-126831-0032 SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
198-126831-0034 THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
198-126831-0035 THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
198-126831-0037 DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
198-126831-0038 ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
198-126831-0040 HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
198-126831-0041 WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0043 WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
198-126831-0044 THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
198-126831-0046 WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
198-126831-0047 AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
198-126831-0049 I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
198-126831-0050 IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
198-126831-0052 I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
198-126831-0053 BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0004 AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0007 WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
198-129977-0008 THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0013 BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
198-129977-0014 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0019 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0020 THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
198-129977-0022 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0025 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-129977-0028 WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
198-129977-0029 AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
198-129977-0031 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-129977-0032 HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
200-124139-0001 THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
200-124139-0002 AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
200-124139-0004 WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
200-124139-0005 SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
200-124139-0007 CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
200-124139-0008 SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
200-124139-0010 AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
200-124139-0011 YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
200-124139-0013 BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
200-124139-0014 AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
200-124139-0016 AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
200-124139-0017 MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
200-124139-0019 I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
200-124139-0020 IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
200-124139-0022 I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL THERE IS NOT A FINER COUNTY IN ENGLAND THAN DERBYSHIRE WITH ALL MY HEART
200-124139-0023 I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
200-124139-0025 WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
200-124139-0026 THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
200-124139-0028 OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
200-124139-0029 NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
200-124139-0031 ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
200-124139-0032 MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
200-124139-0034 A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
200-124139-0035 WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
200-124139-0037 RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
200-124139-0038 IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
200-124140-0001 THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
200-124140-0002 SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
200-124140-0004 INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
200-124140-0005 REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
200-124140-0007 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-124140-0008 OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
200-124140-0010 I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
200-124140-0011 THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
200-124140-0013 OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
200-124140-0014 TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
200-124140-0016 INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
200-124140-0017 WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
200-124140-0019 ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
200-124140-0020 SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
200-124140-0022 FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
200-124140-0023 NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
200-124140-0025 BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
200-124140-0026 THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
200-124140-0028 DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
200-124140-0029 AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
200-124140-0031 LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
200-124140-0032 AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
200-124140-0034 HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
200-124140-0035 BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
200-124140-0037 MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
200-124140-0038 COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON
200-126784-0001 IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
200-126784-0002 WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
200-126784-0004 COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
200-126784-0005 THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
200-126784-0007 THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
200-126784-0008 TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
200-126784-0010 HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
200-126784-0011 RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
200-126784-0013 WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
200-126784-0014 HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
200-126784-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
200-126784-0017 AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
200-126784-0019 NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
200-126784-0020 WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
200-126784-0022 HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
200-126784-0023 STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
200-126784-0025 MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
200-126784-0026 RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
200-126784-0028 HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
200-126784-0029 I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
200-126784-0031 AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
200-126784-0032 MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
200-126784-0034 HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
200-126784-0037 THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
201-122255-0000 THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
201-122255-0002 AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
201-122255-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0005 FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
201-122255-0006 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0008 BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
201-122255-0009 SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
201-122255-0011 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0012 MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
201-122255-0014 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
201-122255-0017 BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
201-122255-0018 LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
201-122255-0020 I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
201-122255-0021 FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
201-122255-0023 NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
201-122255-0024 NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
201-122255-0026 AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
201-122255-0027 AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
201-122255-0029 AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
201-122255-0030 HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
201-122255-0032 EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
201-122255-0033 NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
201-122255-0035 HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
201-122255-0036 SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
201-122255-0038 HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
201-122255-0039 MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
201-122255-0041 THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
201-122255-0042 NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
201-122255-0044 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
201-127786-0077 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
211-122425-0001 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0004 AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0005 THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
211-122425-0007 AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
211-122425-0008 YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
211-122425-0010 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0013 THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
211-122425-0014 ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
211-122425-0016 YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
211-122425-0017 AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
211-122425-0019 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0022 THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0023 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0025 IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
211-122425-0026 IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
211-122425-0028 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0029 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122425-0031 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0032 ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
211-122425-0034 PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0037 LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
211-122425-0038 YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
211-122425-0040 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0041 WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
211-122425-0043 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0044 HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
211-122425-0046 IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
211-122425-0047 AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
211-122425-0049 AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
211-122425-0050 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0052 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0055 DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
211-122425-0056 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0058 AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0059 AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
211-122425-0061 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0062 THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0064 EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
211-122425-0065 WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0067 BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
211-122425-0068 HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
211-122425-0070 AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0071 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0073 OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
211-122425-0074 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0076 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122425-0079 THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
211-122425-0080 NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY

226-122538-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
226-122538-0001 EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
226-122538-0003 AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
226-122538-0004 AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
226-122538-0006 THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
226-122538-0007 AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
226-122538-0009 BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
226-122538-0010 THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
226-122538-0012 WHO KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS ASKING THAT HE MIGHT CATCH THE EYE OF A GENEROUS TRAVELLER HE FELT HE HAD INDEED BEEN LED TO THIS PLAIN BROWN FACED BROAD SHOULDERED LADY WHEN HE REMEMBERED HOW NEARLY
226-122538-0013 AFTER HER CURT NOD FROM A DISTANCE HAD ENGAGED HIM HE HAD RESPONDED TO THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A FUSSY LITTLE WOMAN WITH MANY MORE BAGS AND RUGS AND A PARROT CAGE WHO WAS NOW DOLING FRENCH COPPERS OUT OF THE WINDOW OF THE NEXT COMPARTMENT

226-122538-0018 OVER THE FIRST HALF CROWN HE HAD SAID TO HIMSELF MILK AND NEW LAID EGGS NOW AS HE POCKETED THE SECOND HE ADDED THE OTHER TWO THINGS MENTIONED BY THE PARISH DOCTOR SOUP AND JELLY AND HIS HEART GLOWED
226-122538-0019 YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
226-122538-0021 SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
226-122538-0022 A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
226-122538-0024 MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
226-122538-0025 YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
226-122538-0027 AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
226-122538-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
226-122538-0030 PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
226-122538-0031 WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
226-122538-0033 HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
226-122538-0034 BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
226-131532-0001 AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0004 NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005 WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0007 THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0010 MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011 HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0013 WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
226-131532-0014 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
226-131532-0016 AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017 BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020 NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
226-131532-0025 PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
226-131532-0026 BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0028 YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
226-131532-0029 IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
226-131532-0031 AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032 WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0034 WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
226-131533-0000 YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003 YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006 YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0008 BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0011 FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012 UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0014 AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
226-131533-0015 MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0017 BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018 AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0020 AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021 AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024 IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0026 WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027 REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0032 NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033 BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0035 THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036 I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
229-130880-0001 THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0004 IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
229-130880-0005 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0007 AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
229-130880-0008 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0010 TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
229-130880-0011 THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
229-130880-0013 DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
229-130880-0014 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0019 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0020 THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
229-130880-0022 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0025 AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
229-130880-0026 THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
229-130880-0028 BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
229-130880-0029 IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
229-130880-0031 HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
229-130880-0032 THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
229-130880-0034 AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
229-130880-0035 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
229-130880-0037 DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
229-130880-0038 JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO THE DEVIL TAKE HIM
229-130880-0040 FOR A VISIT TOMORROW TO CEYLON'S MAGNIFICENT PEARL FISHERIES HE DID SO IN THE MOST CORDIAL TERMS AND CONDUCTED HIMSELF LIKE A TRUE GENTLEMAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
229-130880-0041 HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MISTER NATURALIST YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
229-130880-0043 DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY
229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
229-130880-0046 ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
229-130880-0047 NED AND CONSEIL TOOK SEATS ON A COUCH AND RIGHT OFF THE CANADIAN SAID TO ME SIR JUST WHAT IS A PEARL EXACTLY MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED FOR POETS A PEARL IS A TEAR FROM THE SEA
229-130880-0049 NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
229-130880-0050 AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
229-130880-0052 TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
229-130880-0053 LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
229-130880-0055 THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0059 NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
229-130880-0061 THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
229-130880-0062 FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK
229-130880-0064 BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
229-130880-0065 THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
229-130880-0067 THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
229-130880-0068 THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
229-130880-0070 HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
229-130880-0071 THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
229-130880-0073 BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
229-130880-0074 HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
229-130880-0076 CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
229-130880-0077 NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0080 MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
229-130880-0082 MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
229-130880-0083 THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
229-130880-0085 CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
229-130880-0088 WHAT RISKS WOULD YOU RUN IN A JOB LIKE THAT NED LAND SAID SWALLOWING A FEW GULPS OF SALT WATER WHATEVER YOU SAY NED THEN TRYING TO IMITATE CAPTAIN NEMO'S CAREFREE TONE I ASKED
229-130880-0089 BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS
229-130880-0091 OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
229-130880-0092 YOU SEE SIR THESE SHARKS ARE BADLY DESIGNED THEY HAVE TO ROLL THEIR BELLIES OVER TO SNAP YOU UP AND IN THE MEANTIME NED LAND HAD A WAY OF PRONOUNCING THE WORD SNAP
233-134440-0000 IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
233-134440-0001 A HUGE GROTESQUE KIND OF MONKEY A CREATURE WITH UGLY SAGGING HAIRLESS SKIN BELOW HIS EYES AND A BRIGHT PURPLE UNDERBODY THIS MONKEY IS A TRUE MONSTER
233-134440-0003 TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
233-134440-0004 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU NO MYSTERY IN REGARD TO THE BEAST IN HIS CAGE IT IS LIKE WASH WILLIAMS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS HE SITS IN THE CORNER THERE THE BEAST IS EXACTLY LIKE OLD WASH
233-134440-0006 HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
233-134440-0007 HE TOOK CARE OF HIS HANDS HIS FINGERS WERE FAT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND SHAPELY IN THE HAND THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BY THE INSTRUMENT IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN HIS YOUTH
233-134440-0009 WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
233-134440-0010 PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
233-134440-0012 BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
233-134440-0013 IN WINESBURG NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO WASH WILLIAMS AND HIS HATRED OF HIS FELLOWS ONCE MISSUS WHITE THE BANKER'S WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY
233-134440-0015 WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
233-134440-0016 ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
233-134440-0018 THE WOMAN WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND HAD BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR WASH WAS HIMSELF A COMELY YOUTH HE LOVED THE WOMAN WITH A LOVE AS ABSORBING AS THE HATRED HE LATER FELT FOR ALL WOMEN
233-134440-0019 IN ALL OF WINESBURG THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THE STORY OF THE THING THAT HAD MADE UGLY THE PERSON AND THE CHARACTER OF WASH WILLIAMS
233-134440-0021 WHO WORKED IN A MILLINERY SHOP KEPT BY MISSUS KATE MC HUGH THE YOUNG MAN WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN
233-134440-0022 IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
233-134440-0024 AND SAT ON A PILE OF DECAYING RAILROAD TIES BESIDE THE TRACKS IT WAS THEN THAT THE OPERATOR TOLD THE YOUNG REPORTER HIS STORY OF HATE PERHAPS A DOZEN TIMES
233-134440-0025 GEORGE WILLARD AND THE STRANGE SHAPELESS MAN WHO LIVED AT HIS FATHER'S HOTEL HAD BEEN ON THE POINT OF TALKING THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED AT THE HIDEOUS LEERING FACE
233-134440-0027 HE WAITED EXPECTANTLY WHEN THE OPERATOR REMAINED SILENT AND SEEMED TO HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT TALKING HE TRIED TO MAKE CONVERSATION WERE YOU EVER MARRIED MISTER WILLIAMS HE BEGAN
233-134440-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU WERE AND YOUR WIFE IS DEAD IS THAT IT WASH WILLIAMS SPAT FORTH A SUCCESSION OF VILE OATHS YES SHE IS DEAD HE AGREED SHE IS DEAD AS ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD
233-134440-0030 HE COMMANDED MY WIFE SHE IS DEAD YES SURELY I TELL YOU ALL WOMEN ARE DEAD MY MOTHER YOUR MOTHER
233-134440-0031 AND WITH WHOM I SAW YOU WALKING ABOUT YESTERDAY ALL OF THEM THEY ARE ALL DEAD I TELL YOU THERE IS SOMETHING ROTTEN ABOUT THEM I WAS MARRIED SURE MY WIFE WAS DEAD BEFORE SHE MARRIED ME
233-134440-0033 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MEN A LITTLE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WOMEN THEY ARE SENT TO PREVENT MEN MAKING THE WORLD WORTH WHILE IT IS A TRICK IN NATURE UGH THEY ARE CREEPING CRAWLING SQUIRMING THINGS
233-134440-0034 THEY WITH THEIR SOFT HANDS AND THEIR BLUE EYES THE SIGHT OF A WOMAN SICKENS ME WHY I DON'T KILL EVERY WOMAN I SEE I DON'T KNOW
233-134440-0036 WHEN IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS HE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE PURPLE BLOATED FACE AND THE BURNING EYES A CURIOUS FANCY CAME TO HIM WASH WILLIAMS TALKED IN LOW EVEN TONES
233-134440-0037 THAT MADE HIS WORDS SEEM THE MORE TERRIBLE IN THE DARKNESS THE YOUNG REPORTER FOUND HIMSELF IMAGINING THAT HE SAT ON THE RAILROAD TIES BESIDE A COMELY YOUNG MAN WITH BLACK HAIR AND BLACK SHINING EYES
233-134440-0039 HATRED HAD RAISED HIM TO THAT ELEVATION IT IS BECAUSE I SAW YOU KISSING THE LIPS OF THAT BELLE CARPENTER THAT I TELL YOU MY STORY HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO ME MAY NEXT HAPPEN TO YOU
233-134440-0040 ALREADY YOU MAY BE HAVING DREAMS IN YOUR HEAD
233-134440-0042 INTERMINGLED WITH STRINGS OF VILE CURSES THE OPERATOR HAD MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A DENTIST WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THREE SISTERS ON HIS MARRIAGE DAY BECAUSE OF HIS ABILITY HE WAS PROMOTED TO A POSITION AS DISPATCHER
233-134440-0043 AT AN INCREASED SALARY AND SENT TO AN OFFICE AT COLUMBUS OHIO THERE HE SETTLED DOWN WITH HIS YOUNG WIFE AND BEGAN BUYING A HOUSE ON THE INSTALLMENT PLAN THE YOUNG TELEGRAPH OPERATOR WAS MADLY IN LOVE
233-134440-0045 IN THE GARDEN BACK OF OUR HOUSE WE PLANTED VEGETABLES HE SAID YOU KNOW PEAS AND CORN AND SUCH THINGS WE WENT TO COLUMBUS IN EARLY MARCH AND AS SOON AS THE DAYS BECAME WARM I WENT TO WORK IN THE GARDEN
233-134440-0046 WITH A SPADE I TURNED UP THE BLACK GROUND WHILE SHE RAN ABOUT
233-134440-0048 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS A CATCH IN THE VOICE OF THE MAN TALKING IN THE DARKNESS I LOVED HER HE SAID I DON'T CLAIM NOT TO BE A FOOL I LOVE HER YET THERE IN THE DUSK IN THE SPRING EVENING
233-134440-0049 I KISSED HER SHOES AND THE ANKLES ABOVE HER SHOES WHEN THE HEM OF HER GARMENT TOUCHED MY FACE I TREMBLED WHEN AFTER TWO YEARS OF THAT LIFE
233-134440-0051 I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING WHEN SHE HAD GONE I CRIED LIKE A SILLY BOY PRETTY SOON I HAD A CHANCE TO SELL THE HOUSE AND I SENT THAT MONEY TO HER WASH WILLIAMS AND GEORGE WILLARD
233-134440-0052 AROSE FROM THE PILE OF RAILROAD TIES AND WALKED ALONG THE TRACKS TOWARD TOWN THE OPERATOR FINISHED HIS TALE QUICKLY BREATHLESSLY HER MOTHER SENT FOR ME HE SAID
233-134440-0054 I SAT IN THE PARLOR OF THAT HOUSE TWO HOURS HER MOTHER TOOK ME IN THERE AND LEFT ME THEIR HOUSE WAS STYLISH THEY WERE WHAT IS CALLED RESPECTABLE PEOPLE THERE WERE PLUSH CHAIRS AND A COUCH IN THE ROOM
233-134440-0055 I WAS TREMBLING ALL OVER I HATED THE MEN I THOUGHT HAD WRONGED HER I WAS SICK OF LIVING ALONE AND WANTED HER BACK THE LONGER I WAITED THE MORE RAW AND TENDER I BECAME I THOUGHT THAT IF SHE CAME IN AND JUST
233-134440-0057 AGAIN THE MAN'S VOICE BECAME SOFT AND LOW SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM NAKED HE WENT ON HER MOTHER DID THAT WHILE I SAT THERE SHE WAS TAKING THE GIRL'S CLOTHES OFF PERHAPS COAXING HER TO DO IT
233-134440-0058 FIRST I HEARD VOICES AT THE DOOR THAT LED INTO A LITTLE HALLWAY
233-134440-0060 YOU SEE WAITING GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR CAME INTO THE MAIN STREET OF WINESBURG THE LIGHTS FROM THE STORE WINDOWS LAY BRIGHT AND SHINING ON THE SIDEWALKS PEOPLE MOVED ABOUT LAUGHING AND TALKING
233-134440-0061 THE YOUNG REPORTER FELT ILL AND WEAK IN IMAGINATION HE ALSO BECAME OLD AND SHAPELESS I DIDN'T GET THE MOTHER KILLED SAID WASH WILLIAMS STARING UP AND DOWN THE STREET I STRUCK HER ONCE WITH A CHAIR
233-155990-0000 THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0001 THERE CAN BE NO NOBLER CAUSE FOR WHICH TO WORK THAN THE PEACE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HIGH HONOR IS DUE THOSE SERENE AND LOFTY SOULS WHO WITH WISDOM AND COURAGE
233-155990-0003 BETWEEN MAN AND MAN SHALL END THROUGHOUT THE WORLD BECAUSE ALL THIS IS TRUE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THERE ARE NO MEN MORE IGNOBLE OR MORE FOOLISH NO MEN WHOSE ACTIONS ARE FRAUGHT WITH GREATER POSSIBILITY OF MISCHIEF
233-155990-0004 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0006 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0009 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0010 AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0013 BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
233-155990-0015 AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0016 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0018 AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
233-155990-0019 THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
233-155990-0021 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
233-155990-0022 YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
233-155990-0024 BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
233-155990-0025 SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0030 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0031 OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0036 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0039 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0042 IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
233-155990-0043 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0045 IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
233-155990-0046 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
250-140277-0001 NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
250-140277-0002 AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
250-140277-0004 AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
250-140277-0005 NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
250-140277-0007 FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
250-140277-0008 WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
250-140277-0010 AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL
250-140277-0011 THE RELATION IN WHICH INSTITUTIONAL RELIGION DOES OR SHOULD STAND TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE IS ALSO IN PART A MATTER FOR PSYCHOLOGY WHICH IS HERE CALLED UPON TO DEAL WITH THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
250-140277-0013 AND A FURTHER SECTION SUGGESTS SOME WAYS IN WHICH EDUCATIONISTS MIGHT PROMOTE THE UP SPRINGING OF THIS LIFE IN THE YOUNG FINALLY THE LAST CHAPTER ATTEMPTS TO PLACE THE FACT OF THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT IN ITS RELATION TO THE SOCIAL ORDER
250-140277-0014 AND TO INDICATE SOME OF THE RESULTS WHICH MIGHT FOLLOW UPON ITS HEALTHY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT IT IS SUPERFLUOUS TO POINT OUT THAT EACH OF THESE SUBJECTS NEEDS AT LEAST A VOLUME TO ITSELF
250-140277-0016 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE LIFE OF THE SPIRIT TWO CONTEMPLATION AND SUGGESTION
250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0001 MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
250-142286-0002 BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
250-142286-0004 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0007 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0010 BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
250-142286-0011 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0013 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0016 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0017 BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
250-142286-0019 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0022 WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
250-142286-0023 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0025 TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
250-142286-0026 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0029 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
250-142286-0031 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
250-142286-0032 SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
254-12312-0001 IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
254-12312-0002 THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
254-12312-0004 SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
254-12312-0005 THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
254-12312-0007 THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
254-12312-0008 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
254-12312-0010 BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
254-12312-0011 SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
254-12312-0013 AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
254-12312-0014 O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
254-12312-0016 WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
254-12312-0017 SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
254-12312-0019 IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
254-12312-0020 AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
254-27760-0000 WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
254-27760-0001 HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD

254-27760-0010 NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
254-27760-0012 MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
254-27760-0013 I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING
254-27760-0015 FOOD THERE IS NONE IN THE MORNING IT'S BREAD AT DINNER GRUEL AND IN THE EVENING BREAD AGAIN AS FOR TEA OR SOUR CABBAGE SOUP THE MASTER AND THE MISTRESS THEMSELVES GUZZLE THAT

254-27760-0018 THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
254-27760-0019 AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK
254-27760-0021 BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
254-27760-0022 THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
254-27760-0024 TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
254-27760-0025 HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
254-27760-0027 THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
254-27760-0028 SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND

254-27760-0033 FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
254-27760-0034 AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
254-127705-0001 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0002 INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
254-127705-0004 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-127705-0005 MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
254-127705-0007 AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
254-127705-0008 TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
254-127705-0010 IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
254-127705-0011 THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
254-127705-0013 AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
254-127705-0014 SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
254-127705-0016 MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
254-127705-0017 BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
254-127705-0019 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
254-127705-0020 POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
254-127705-0022 MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
254-127705-0023 A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
254-127705-0025 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
254-127705-0026 THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
254-127705-0028 AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
254-127705-0029 BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
254-127705-0031 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
254-127705-0032 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-127705-0034 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
254-127705-0035 BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
254-127705-0037 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
254-127705-0038 CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
254-127705-0040 BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
254-127705-0041 AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
254-145458-0000 IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
254-145458-0001 INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
254-145458-0003 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0004 MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
254-145458-0006 SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
254-145458-0007 WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
254-145458-0009 IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
254-145458-0010 OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
254-145458-0012 IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
254-145458-0013 WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
254-145458-0015 TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
254-145458-0016 HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
254-145458-0018 LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
254-145458-0019 IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
254-145458-0021 AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
289-121652-0000 NONE OF US WHETHER CHILDREN OR ADULTS NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION TO MOTHER GOOSE THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE EARLIEST IMPRESSED UPON OUR MINDS CLING TO THEM MOST TENACIOUSLY THE SNATCHES SUNG IN THE NURSERY ARE NEVER FORGOTTEN
289-121652-0002 AND SEE THE KINDLY WRINKLED FACE OF THE GRANDMOTHER AS SHE CROONS THE OLD DITTIES TO QUIET OUR RESTLESS SPIRITS ONE GENERATION IS LINKED TO ANOTHER BY THE EVERLASTING SPIRIT OF SONG
289-121652-0003 THE BALLADS OF THE NURSERY FOLLOW US FROM CHILDHOOD TO OLD AGE AND THEY ARE READILY BROUGHT FROM MEMORY'S RECESSES AT ANY TIME TO AMUSE OUR CHILDREN OR OUR GRANDCHILDREN THE COLLECTION OF JINGLES WE KNOW AND LOVE AS THE MELODIES OF MOTHER GOOSE
289-121652-0005 THE RESEARCH AFTER THE AUTHOR OF EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE WOULD INDEED BE HOPELESS IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO SUPPOSE THEM ALL THE COMPOSITION OF UNEDUCATED OLD NURSES FOR MANY OF THEM CONTAIN MUCH REFLECTION WIT AND MELODY
289-121652-0006 IT IS SAID THAT SHELLEY WROTE PUSSY CAT MEW AND DEAN SWIFT LITTLE BO PEEP AND THESE ASSERTIONS ARE AS DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE AS TO PROVE SOME OF THE OLDER VERSES HOWEVER
289-121652-0008 FRANCE ENGLAND AND AMERICA ABOUT THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY THERE APPEARED IN CIRCULATION IN LONDON A SMALL BOOK NAMED RHYMES OF THE NURSERY OR LULLA BYES FOR CHILDREN
289-121652-0009 WHICH CONTAINED MANY OF THE IDENTICAL PIECES THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED DOWN TO US BUT THE NAME OF MOTHER GOOSE WAS EVIDENTLY NOT THEN KNOWN IN THIS EDITION WERE THE RHYMES OF LITTLE JACK HOMER OLD KING COLE MISTRESS MARY SING A SONG O SIXPENCE
289-121652-0011 ALTHOUGH PERRAULT'S TALES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE WE NOW KNOW UNDER THIS TITLE THEY COMPRISED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY THE FAIRY LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BLUE BEARD PUSS IN BOOTS
289-121652-0012 RIQUET WITH THE TUFT CINDERELLA AND LITTLE THUMB EIGHT STORIES IN ALL ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK WAS DEPICTED AN OLD LADY HOLDING IN HER HAND A DISTAFF
289-121652-0014 WRITTEN ALSO VERGOOSE AND VERTIGOOSE WHO BELONGED TO A WEALTHY FAMILY HER ELDEST DAUGHTER ELIZABETH GOOSE OR VERTIGOOSE
289-121652-0015 AND IN DUE TIME GAVE BIRTH TO A SON LIKE MOST MOTHERS IN LAW IN OUR DAY THE IMPORTANCE OF MISSUS GOOSE INCREASED WITH THE APPEARANCE OF HER GRANDCHILD AND POOR MISTER FLEET HALF DISTRACTED WITH HER ENDLESS NURSERY DITTIES FINDING ALL OTHER MEANS FAIL
289-121652-0017 PRINTED BY T FLEET AT HIS PRINTING HOUSE IN PUDDING LANE SEVENTEEN NINETEEN PRICE TWO COPPERS MISTER WM A WHEELER THE EDITOR OF HURD AND HOUGHTON'S ELABORATE EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE EIGHTEEN SEVENTY REITERATED THIS ASSERTION
289-121652-0018 AND A WRITER IN THE BOSTON TRANSCRIPT OF JUNE SEVENTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR SAYS FLEET'S BOOK WAS PARTLY A REPRINT OF AN ENGLISH COLLECTION OF SONGS BARCLAY'S AND THE NEW TITLE WAS DOUBTLESS A COMPLIMENT BY THE PRINTER TO HIS MOTHER IN LAW GOOSE FOR HER CONTRIBUTIONS
289-121652-0020 BUT THE REST OF THE STORY IS UNSUPPORTED BY ANY EVIDENCE WHATEVER IN FACT ALL THAT MISTER ELIOT KNEW OF IT WAS THE STATEMENT OF THE LATE EDWARD A CROWNINSHIELD OF BOSTON THAT HE HAD SEEN FLEET'S EDITION IN THE LIBRARY OF THE AMERICAN ANTIQUARIAN SOCIETY
289-121652-0021 REPEATED RESEARCHES AT WORCESTER HAVING FAILED TO BRING TO LIGHT THIS SUPPOSED COPY AND NO RECORD OF IT APPEARING ON ANY CATALOGUE THERE WE MAY DISMISS THE ENTIRE STORY WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT MISTER ELIOT MISUNDERSTOOD THE REMARKS MADE TO HIM
289-121652-0023 BOSTON CHILDREN AT THAT DATE SAYS MISTER WHITMORE WERE FED UPON GOSPEL FOOD AND IT SEEMS EXTREMELY IMPROBABLE THAT AN EDITION COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD
289-121652-0024 IS OF ABOUT THE SAME DATE AS BOSTON'S THERE LIVED IN A TOWN IN SUSSEX ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN O FOUR AN OLD WOMAN NAMED MARTHA GOOCH SHE WAS A CAPITAL NURSE AND IN GREAT DEMAND TO CARE FOR NEWLY BORN BABIES THEREFORE
289-121652-0026 SEEMED SO SENSELESS AND SILLY TO THE PEOPLE WHO OVERHEARD THEM THAT THEY BEGAN TO CALL HER MOTHER GOOSE IN DERISION THE TERM BEING DERIVED FROM QUEEN GOOSEFOOT THE MOTHER OF CHARLEMAGNE THE OLD NURSE PAID NO ATTENTION TO HER CRITICS
289-121652-0027 BUT CONTINUED TO SING HER RHYMES AS BEFORE FOR HOWEVER MUCH GROWN PEOPLE MIGHT LAUGH AT HER THE CHILDREN SEEMED TO ENJOY THEM VERY MUCH AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS TOO PEEVISH TO BE QUIETED AND SOOTHED BY HER VERSES
289-121652-0029 WHICH IT IS SAID WAS PRINTED BY JOHN WORTHINGTON AND SON IN THE STRAND LONDON IN SEVENTEEN TWELVE UNDER THE NAME OF YE MELODIOUS RHYMES OF MOTHER GOOSE BUT EVEN THIS STORY OF MARTHA GOOCH
289-121652-0030 IS BASED UPON VERY MEAGER AND UNSATISFACTORY EVIDENCE THE EARLIEST ENGLISH EDITION OF MOTHER GOOSE'S MELODIES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC WAS ISSUED BY JOHN NEWBURY OF LONDON ABOUT THE YEAR SEVENTEEN SIXTY AND THE FIRST AUTHENTIC AMERICAN EDITION
289-121652-0032 SOME OF THE EARLIER VERSES HAVE BECOME ENTIRELY OBSOLETE AND IT IS WELL THEY HAVE FOR MANY WERE CRUDE AND SILLY AND OTHERS WERE COARSE IT IS SIMPLY A RESULT OF THE GREATER REFINEMENT OF MODERN CIVILIZATION
289-121652-0033 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO OBLIVION WHILE THE REAL GEMS OF THE COLLECTION WILL DOUBTLESS LIVE AND GROW IN POPULAR FAVOR FOR MANY AGES
289-121652-0035 AND EACH INDIVIDUAL VERSE APPEALS MORE TO THE CHILDISH MIND THAN DOES MOTHER GOOSE HERSELF MANY OF THESE NURSERY RHYMES ARE COMPLETE TALES IN THEMSELVES TELLING THEIR STORY TERSELY BUT COMPLETELY THERE ARE OTHERS WHICH ARE BUT BARE SUGGESTIONS
289-121652-0036 LEAVING THE IMAGINATION TO WEAVE IN THE DETAILS OF THE STORY PERHAPS THEREIN MAY LIE PART OF THEIR CHARM BUT HOWEVER THAT MAY BE I HAVE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN MIGHT LIKE THE STORIES TOLD AT GREATER LENGTH THAT THEY MAY DWELL THE LONGER UPON THEIR FAVORITE HEROES AND HEROINES
289-121652-0038 L FRANK BAUM CHICAGO ILLINOIS
289-121665-0000 AND ONE OF THESE FLOCKS USED TO BE CARED FOR BY A POOR WOMAN WHO SUPPORTED HERSELF AND HER LITTLE GIRL BY THIS MEANS THEY LIVED IN A SMALL COTTAGE NESTLED AT THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE HILLS AND EACH MORNING THE MOTHER TOOK HER CROOK
289-121665-0002 UPON THE GRASSY MOUNDS AND WATCHED HER CARE FOR THE EWES AND LAMBS SO THAT IN TIME SHE HERSELF GREW TO BE A VERY PROFICIENT SHEPHERDESS SO WHEN THE MOTHER BECAME TOO OLD AND FEEBLE TO LEAVE HER COTTAGE LITTLE BO PEEP AS SHE WAS CALLED
289-121665-0003 DECIDED THAT SHE WAS FULLY ABLE TO MANAGE THE FLOCKS HERSELF SHE WAS A LITTLE MITE OF A CHILD WITH FLOWING NUT BROWN LOCKS AND BIG GRAY EYES THAT CHARMED ALL WHO GAZED INTO THEIR INNOCENT DEPTHS SHE WORE A LIGHT GRAY FROCK
289-121665-0005 AND THERE WERE MANY WILLING HANDS TO AID HER IF WHICH WAS NOT OFTEN SHE NEEDED THEIR ASSISTANCE BO PEEP USUALLY TOOK HER SHEEP TO THE SIDE OF A HIGH HILL ABOVE THE COTTAGE AND ALLOWED THEM TO EAT THE RICH GRASS WHILE SHE HERSELF SAT UPON A MOUND AND
289-121665-0006 LAYING ASIDE HER CROOK AND HER BROAD STRAW HAT WITH ITS PINK RIBBONS DEVOTED HER TIME TO SEWING AND MENDING STOCKINGS FOR HER AGED MOTHER ONE DAY WHILE THUS OCCUPIED
289-121665-0008 DEEP WRINKLES SEAMED HER FACE AND HANDS WHILE HER NOSE AND CHIN WERE SO POINTED THAT THEY NEARLY MET SHE WAS NOT PLEASANT TO LOOK UPON BUT BO PEEP HAD LEARNED TO BE POLITE TO THE AGED SO SHE ANSWERED SWEETLY
289-121665-0009 GOOD MORNING MOTHER CAN I DO ANYTHING FOR YOU NO DEARIE RETURNED THE WOMAN IN A CRACKED VOICE BUT I WILL SIT BY YOUR SIDE AND REST FOR A TIME THE GIRL MADE ROOM ON THE MOUND BESIDE HER
289-121665-0011 BUT WHERE IS YOUR CROOK ON THE GRASS BESIDE ME AND WHERE ARE YOUR SHEEP BO PEEP LOOKED UP AND COULD NOT SEE THEM THEY MUST HAVE STRAYED OVER THE TOP OF THE HILL SHE SAID AND I WILL GO AND SEEK THEM
289-121665-0012 DO NOT BE IN A HURRY CROAKED THE OLD WOMAN THEY WILL RETURN PRESENTLY WITHOUT YOUR TROUBLING TO FIND THEM DO YOU THINK SO ASKED BO PEEP OF COURSE DO NOT THE SHEEP KNOW YOU
289-121665-0014 THE OLD WOMAN CHUCKLED SOFTLY AS IF THE ANSWER AMUSED HER AND REPLIED NO ONE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ANYTHING MY DEAR BUT I KNOW ALL ABOUT MY SHEEP PROTESTED LITTLE BO PEEP DO YOU INDEED
289-121665-0015 THEN YOU ARE WISER THAT MOST PEOPLE AND IF YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM YOU ALSO KNOW THEY WILL COME HOME OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL ALL BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AS USUAL
289-121665-0017 PERHAPS YOU HAVE NEVER NOTICED THEIR TAILS AT ALL NO ANSWERED BO PEEP THOUGHTFULLY I DO N'T KNOW THAT I EVER HAVE THE WOMAN LAUGHED SO HARD AT THIS REPLY
289-121665-0018 THAT SHE BEGAN TO COUGH AND THIS MADE THE GIRL REMEMBER THAT HER FLOCK HAD STRAYED AWAY I REALLY MUST GO AND FIND MY SHEEP SHE SAID RISING TO HER FEET AND THEN I SHALL BE SURE TO NOTICE THEIR TAILS AND SEE IF THEY WAG THEM SIT STILL MY CHILD
289-121665-0020 AND DOES N'T KNOW WHERE TO FIND EM BUT LEAVE EM ALONE AND THEY LL COME HOME ALL WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND EM LITTLE BO PEEP SAT STILL AND WATCHED THE OLD WOMAN TOIL SLOWLY UP THE HILL SIDE AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE TOP BY AND BY SHE THOUGHT
289-121665-0021 VERY SOON I SHALL SEE THE SHEEP COMING BACK BUT TIME PASSED AWAY AND STILL THE ERRANT FLOCK FAILED TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE SOON THE HEAD OF THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS BEGAN TO NOD
289-121665-0023 BUT AS IT WAS NOW TIME FOR LUNCHEON SHE OPENED HER LITTLE BASKET AND ATE OF THE BREAD AND CHEESE AND COOKIES SHE HAD BROUGHT WITH HER AFTER SHE HAD FINISHED HER MEAL AND TAKEN A DRINK OF COOL WATER FROM A SPRING NEAR BY
289-121665-0024 SHE DECIDED SHE WOULD NOT WAIT ANY LONGER SO UP SHE TOOK HER LITTLE CROOK DETERMINED FOR TO FIND THEM AND BEGAN CLIMBING THE HILL WHEN SHE GOT TO THE TOP THERE WAS NEVER A SIGHT OF SHEEP ABOUT
289-121665-0026 GAZED BELOW HER QUIETLY FEEDING UPON THE RICH GRASS WAS HER TRUANT FLOCK LOOKING AS PEACEFUL AND INNOCENT AS IF IT HAD NEVER STRAYED AWAY FROM ITS GENTLE SHEPHERDESS BO PEEP UTTERED A CRY OF JOY AND HURRIED TOWARD THEM
289-121665-0027 BUT WHEN SHE CAME NEAR SHE STOPPED IN AMAZEMENT AND HELD UP HER LITTLE HANDS WITH A PRETTY EXPRESSION OF DISMAY SHE HAD FOUND THEM INDEED BUT IT MADE HER HEART BLEED
289-121665-0029 BUT AFTER AWHILE THE TINY MAID REALIZED THAT ALL HER TEARS WOULD NOT BRING BACK THE TAILS TO HER LAMBKINS SO SHE PLUCKED UP COURAGE AND DRIED HER EYES AND AROSE FROM THE GROUND JUST AS THE OLD WOMAN HOBBLED UP TO HER
289-121665-0030 SO YOU HAVE FOUND YOUR SHEEP DEARIE SHE SAID IN HER CRACKED VOICE YES REPLIED LITTLE BO PEEP WITH DIFFICULTY REPRESSING A SOB BUT LOOK MOTHER THEY VE ALL LEFT THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM WHY SO THEY HAVE EXCLAIMED THE OLD WOMAN
289-121665-0032 AND THEN SHE PATTED THE CHILD UPON HER HEAD AND WALKED AWAY DOWN THE VALLEY BO PEEP WAS MUCH GRIEVED OVER THE LOSS THAT HAD BEFALLEN HER DEAR SHEEP AND SO DRIVING THEM BEFORE HER SHE WANDERED AROUND TO SEE IF BY ANY CHANCE SHE COULD FIND THE LOST TAILS
289-121665-0033 BUT SOON THE SUN BEGAN TO SINK OVER THE HILL TOPS AND SHE KNEW SHE MUST TAKE HER SHEEP HOME BEFORE NIGHT OVERTOOK THEM SHE DID NOT TELL HER MOTHER OF HER MISFORTUNE FOR SHE FEARED THE OLD SHEPHERDESS WOULD SCOLD HER
289-121665-0035 AND THOSE WHO MET HER WONDERED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SWEET LITTLE MAID SO ANXIOUS BUT THERE IS AN END TO ALL TROUBLES NO MATTER HOW SEVERE THEY MAY SEEM TO BE AND IT HAPPENED ONE DAY AS BO PEEP DID STRAY UNTO A MEADOW HARD BY
289-121665-0036 THE LITTLE SHEPHERDESS WAS OVERJOYED AT THIS DISCOVERY AND REACHING UP HER CROOK SHE KNOCKED THE ROW OF PRETTY WHITE TAILS OFF THE TREE AND GATHERED THEM UP IN HER FROCK BUT HOW TO FASTEN THEM ONTO HER SHEEP AGAIN WAS THE QUESTION
289-121665-0038 WHY SHE EXCLAIMED SMILING AGAIN I CAN SEW THEM ON OF COURSE THEN SHE HEAVED A SIGH AND WIPED HER EYE AND RAN O'ER HILL AND DALE OH AND TRIED WHAT SHE COULD AS A SHEPHERDESS SHOULD TO TACK TO EACH SHEEP ITS TAIL OH
289-121665-0039 BUT THE VERY FIRST SHEEP SHE CAME TO REFUSED TO ALLOW HER TO SEW ON THE TAIL AND RAN AWAY FROM HER AND THE OTHERS DID THE SAME SO THAT FINALLY SHE WAS UTTERLY DISCOURAGED SHE WAS BEGINNING TO CRY AGAIN WHEN THE SAME OLD WOMAN SHE HAD BEFORE MET
289-121665-0041 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THEM I THOUGHT THEY BELONGED TO MY SHEEP ANSWERED BO PEEP SORROWFULLY
289-121665-0042 I MUST HUNT UNTIL I FIND THOSE THAT BELONG TO MY SHEEP MY DEAR SAID THE OLD WOMAN I HAVE BEEN DECEIVING YOU YOU SAID YOU KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR SHEEP AND I WANTED TO TEACH YOU A LESSON FOR HOWEVER WISE WE MAY BE
289-121665-0044 AND IF YOU HAD BEEN OBSERVING YOU WOULD HAVE KNOWN ALL THIS WHEN I SAID THE SHEEP WOULD BE WAGGING THEIR TAILS BEHIND THEM AND THEN YOU WOULD NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THOSE DAYS IN SEARCHING FOR WHAT IS NOT TO BE FOUND
289-121665-0045 SO NOW LITTLE ONE RUN AWAY HOME AND TRY TO BE MORE THOUGHTFUL IN THE FUTURE YOUR SHEEP WILL NEVER MISS THE TAILS
298-126790-0000 THE FAMILY AT THE LOCUSTS HAD SLEPT OR WATCHED THROUGH ALL THE DISTURBANCES AT THE COTTAGE OF BIRCH IN PERFECT IGNORANCE OF THEIR OCCURRENCE THE ATTACKS OF THE SKINNERS WERE ALWAYS MADE WITH SO MUCH PRIVACY AS TO EXCLUDE THE SUFFERERS
298-126790-0001 BUT FREQUENTLY THROUGH A DREAD OF FUTURE DEPREDATIONS FROM THE COMMISERATION OF THEIR NEIGHBORS ALSO ADDITIONAL DUTIES HAD DRAWN THE LADIES FROM THEIR PILLOWS AT AN HOUR SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL AND CAPTAIN LAWTON
298-126790-0003 THE DOCTOR HAD WATCHED DURING THE NIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE BED OF CAPTAIN SINGLETON WITHOUT ONCE CLOSING HIS EYES OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD PAY A VISIT TO THE WOUNDED ENGLISHMAN WHO BEING MORE HURT IN THE SPIRIT THAN IN THE FLESH
298-126790-0004 TOLERATED THE INTERRUPTIONS WITH A VERY ILL GRACE AND ONCE FOR AN INSTANT HE VENTURED TO STEAL SOFTLY TO THE BED OF HIS OBSTINATE COMRADE AND WAS NEAR SUCCEEDING IN OBTAINING A TOUCH OF HIS PULSE WHEN A TERRIBLE OATH SWORN BY THE TROOPER IN A DREAM
298-126790-0006 MISS PEYTON WAS LOOKING FROM A WINDOW IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TENEMENT OF THE PEDDLER AND WAS EXPRESSING A KIND ANXIETY AFTER THE WELFARE OF THE SICK MAN WHEN THE PERSON OF KATY SUDDENLY EMERGED FROM THE DENSE COVERING OF AN EARTHLY CLOUD WHOSE MISTS WERE SCATTERING BEFORE THE CHEERING RAYS OF THE SUN
298-126790-0007 AND WAS SEEN MAKING HASTY STEPS TOWARDS THE LOCUSTS THERE WAS THAT IN THE AIR OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WHICH BESPOKE DISTRESS OF AN UNUSUAL NATURE AND THE KIND HEARTED MISTRESS OF THE LOCUSTS OPENED THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WITH THE BENEVOLENT INTENTION OF SOOTHING A GRIEF
298-126790-0009 KATY IS HE GONE NO MA'AM REPLIED THE DISTURBED DAMSEL WITH GREAT BITTERNESS HE IS NOT YET GONE BUT HE MAY GO AS SOON AS HE PLEASES NOW FOR THE WORST IS DONE
298-126790-0010 AND THOSE HE HAS ON ARE NONE OF THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU HOW EXCLAIMED THE OTHER ASTONISHED COULD ANYONE HAVE THE HEART TO PLUNDER A MAN IN SUCH DISTRESS HEARTS REPEATED KATY CATCHING HER BREATH MEN LIKE THEM HAVE NO BOWELS AT ALL PLUNDER AND DISTRESS INDEED
298-126790-0012 BESIDES WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE DEERSKIN PURSE BUT HARVEY IS LITTLE BETTER NOW THAN A BEGGAR AND A BEGGAR MISS JEANETTE IS THE MOST AWFULLY DESPISABLE OF ALL EARTHLY CREATURES
298-126790-0013 THE COUNTENANCE OF KATY CHANGED FROM THE NATURAL EXPRESSION OF CONCERN TO THE SET FORM OF MELANCHOLY AS SHE ANSWERED HE IS HAPPILY REMOVED FROM THE CARES OF THE WORLD THE CHINKING OF THE MONEY MADE HIM GET OUT OF HIS BED AND THE POOR SOUL FOUND THE SHOCK TOO GREAT FOR HIM
298-126790-0015 REPLIED TWAS THE TROUBLES OF THE TIMES AND THE LOSS OF PROPERTY THAT BROUGHT HIM DOWN HE WASTED FROM DAY TO DAY AND ALL MY CARE AND ANXIETY WERE LOST FOR NOW HARVEY IS NO BETTER THAN A BEGGAR AND WHO IS THERE TO PAY ME FOR WHAT I HAVE DONE
298-126790-0016 GOD WILL REWARD YOU FOR ALL THE GOOD YOU HAVE DONE SAID MISS PEYTON MILDLY YES INTERRUPTED THE SPINSTER HASTILY AND WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE THAT WAS INSTANTLY SUCCEEDED BY AN EXPRESSION THAT DENOTED MORE OF WORLDLY CARE
298-126790-0018 WHY RETURNED THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATING A LITTLE I THOUGHT WE WERE AS GOOD AS SO I WONDER IF I HAVE NO CLAIM ON THE HOUSE AND GARDEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOW IT IS HARVEY'S IT WILL SURELY BE CONFISCATED TURNING TO LAWTON WHO HAD BEEN SITTING IN ONE POSTURE WITH HIS
298-126790-0019 PIERCING EYES LOWERING AT HER THROUGH HIS THICK BROWS IN SILENCE PERHAPS THIS GENTLEMAN KNOWS HE SEEMS TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN MY STORY MADAM SAID THE TROOPER BOWING VERY LOW BOTH YOU AND THE TALE ARE EXTREMELY INTERESTING KATY SMILED INVOLUNTARILY
298-126790-0021 THE SURGEON DREW UP AND EMPLOYED HIMSELF IN WHISTLING A LOW AIR AS HE LOOKED OVER SOME PHIALS ON A TABLE BUT THE HOUSEKEEPER TURNING TO HIM WITH AN INCLINATION OF THE HEAD CONTINUED I SUPPOSE SIR A WOMAN HAS NO DOWER IN HER HUSBAND'S PROPERTY UNLESS THEY BE ACTUALLY MARRIED
298-126790-0022 IT WAS A MAXIM WITH DOCTOR SITGREAVES THAT NO SPECIES OF KNOWLEDGE WAS TO BE DESPISED AND CONSEQUENTLY HE WAS AN EMPIRIC IN EVERYTHING BUT HIS PROFESSION AT FIRST INDIGNATION AT THE IRONY OF HIS COMRADE KEPT HIM SILENT BUT SUDDENLY CHANGING HIS PURPOSE
298-126790-0024 TO THIS PART OF HIS SPEECH THEN SHE DIRECTED HER REPLY I DID THINK HE ONLY WAITED THE DEATH OF THE OLD GENTLEMAN BEFORE HE MARRIED SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER LOOKING ON THE CARPET BUT NOW HE IS NOTHING MORE THAN DESPISABLE OR WHAT'S THE SAME THING A PEDDLER WITHOUT HOUSE PACK OR MONEY
298-126790-0025 IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR A MAN TO GET A WIFE AT ALL IN SUCH A PREDICARY DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD MISS PEYTON I SELDOM TROUBLE MYSELF WITH SUCH THINGS SAID THE LADY GRAVELY DURING THIS DIALOGUE CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN STUDYING THE COUNTENANCE AND MANNER OF THE HOUSEKEEPER WITH A MOST LUDICROUS GRAVITY
298-126790-0027 BUT I SUPPOSE HIS TIME HAD COME AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS IT MATTERS BUT LITTLE WHAT DOCTOR'S STUFF WE TAKE LET ME SET YOU RIGHT IN THAT PARTICULAR INTERRUPTED THE SURGEON WE MUST ALL DIE IT IS TRUE BUT IT IS PERMITTED US TO USE THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE IN ARRESTING DANGERS AS THEY OCCUR UNTIL
298-126790-0028 WE CAN DIE SECUNDEM ARTEM CRIED THE TROOPER TO THIS OBSERVATION THE PHYSICIAN DID NOT DEIGN TO REPLY BUT DEEMING IT NECESSARY TO HIS PROFESSIONAL DIGNITY THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD CONTINUE HE ADDED PERHAPS IN THIS INSTANCE JUDICIOUS TREATMENT MIGHT HAVE PROLONGED THE LIFE OF THE PATIENT
298-126790-0030 UNDER MINE ANSWERED KATY WITH AN AIR OF A LITTLE IMPORTANCE AND CARE THROWN AWAY I MAY WELL CALL IT FOR HARVEY IS QUITE TOO DESPISABLE TO BE ANY SORT OF COMPENSATION AT PRESENT THE MUTUAL IGNORANCE OF EACH OTHER'S MEANING MADE VERY LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO THE DIALOGUE
298-126790-0031 I DOCTORED HIM MOSTLY WITH YARBS SAID THE HOUSEKEEPER SMILING AS IF CONSCIOUS OF ERROR WITH SIMPLES RETURNED THE SURGEON THEY ARE SAFER IN THE HANDS OF THE UNLETTERED THAN MORE POWERFUL REMEDIES BUT WHY HAD YOU NO REGULAR ATTENDANT
298-126790-0033 DOCTOR SITGREAVES DOES NOT MEAN A RIG'LAR SOLDIER BUT A REGULAR PHYSICIAN MADAM SAID THE TROOPER OH CRIED THE MAIDEN AGAIN CORRECTING HERSELF FOR THE BEST OF ALL REASONS THERE WAS NONE TO BE HAD SO I TOOK CARE OF HIM MYSELF
298-126790-0034 FOR MY PART I AM CLEAR FOR DOCTORING THOUGH HARVEY SAYS I AM KILLING MYSELF WITH MEDICINES
298-126790-0036 YOU APPEAR TO BE A SENSIBLE DISCREET WOMAN AND SOME WHO HAVE HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF ACQUIRING MORE CORRECT VIEWS MIGHT ENVY YOU YOUR RESPECT FOR KNOWLEDGE AND THE LIGHTS OF SCIENCE ALTHOUGH THE HOUSEKEEPER DID NOT ALTOGETHER COMPREHEND THE OTHER'S MEANING SHE KNEW HE USED A COMPLIMENT
298-126790-0037 AND AS SUCH WAS HIGHLY PLEASED WITH WHAT HE SAID
298-126790-0039 IN THE ABSENCE OF MORE ENLIGHTENED COUNSELORS THE EXPERIENCE OF A DISCREET MATRON IS FREQUENTLY OF GREAT EFFICACY IN CHECKING THE PROGRESS OF DISEASE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MADAM IT IS DREADFUL TO HAVE TO CONTEND WITH IGNORANCE AND OBSTINACY
298-126790-0040 HARVEY IS AS OBSTINATE ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS A DUMB BEAST ONE WOULD THINK THE CARE I TOOK OF HIS BEDRIDDEN FATHER MIGHT LEARN HIM BETTER THAN TO DESPISE GOOD NURSING BUT SOME DAY HE MAY KNOW WHAT IT IS TO WANT A CAREFUL WOMAN IN HIS HOUSE THOUGH NOW I AM SURE HE IS TOO DESPISABLE HIMSELF TO HAVE A HOUSE
298-126790-0042 THE HOUSEKEEPER HESITATED A MOMENT AT A LOSS TO COMPREHEND ALL THAT THE SURGEON EXPRESSED YET SHE FELT IT WAS BOTH COMPLIMENTARY AND KIND THEREFORE SUPPRESSING HER NATURAL FLOW OF LANGUAGE A LITTLE SHE REPLIED
298-126790-0043 I TELL HARVEY HIS CONDUCT IS OFTEN CONDEMNABLE AND LAST NIGHT HE MADE MY WORDS GOOD BUT THE OPINIONS OF SUCH UNBELIEVERS IS NOT VERY CONSEQUENTIAL YET IT IS DREADFUL TO THINK HOW HE BEHAVES AT TIMES NOW WHEN HE THREW AWAY THE NEEDLE
298-126791-0000 THE MORNING FOUND THEM ALL RESTORED IN SOME MEASURE TO THEIR FORMER EASE OF BODY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS WHO HAD BEEN SO DEEPLY REGRETTED BY DUNWOODIE THE WOUND OF THIS OFFICER WAS SEVERE THOUGH THE SURGEON PERSEVERED IN SAYING THAT IT WAS WITHOUT DANGER
298-126791-0001 AND DOCTOR SITGREAVES REMOVED ALL FURTHER APPREHENSIONS BY CONFIDENTLY PRONOUNCING THAT HE WOULD BE A WELL MAN WITHIN A FORTNIGHT
298-126791-0003 AND THE LATTER ADVANCED PROMPTLY AND LAID HIS FINGERS ON THE PULSE OF THE YOUTH BECKONING TO HIM TO BE SILENT WHILE HE MUTTERED GROWING SYMPTOMS OF A FEBRILE PULSE NO NO MY DEAR GEORGE YOU MUST REMAIN QUIET AND DUMB THOUGH YOUR EYES LOOK BETTER AND YOUR SKIN HAS EVEN A MOISTURE
298-126791-0004 NAY MY DEAR SITGREAVES SAID THE YOUTH TAKING HIS HAND YOU SEE THERE IS NO FEVER ABOUT ME LOOK IS THERE ANY OF JACK LAWTON'S HOARFROST ON MY TONGUE NO INDEED SAID THE SURGEON CLAPPING A SPOON IN THE MOUTH OF THE OTHER FORCING IT OPEN AND LOOKING DOWN HIS THROAT AS IF DISPOSED TO VISIT THE INTERIOR IN PERSON
298-126791-0006 WHY GEORGE YOUR CASE IS BECOMING SINGULAR CONTINUED THE DOCTOR INSTINCTIVELY THROWING ASIDE HIS WIG YOUR PULSE EVEN AND SOFT YOUR SKIN MOIST BUT YOUR EYE FIERY AND CHEEK FLUSHED OH I MUST EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY INTO THESE SYMPTOMS
298-126791-0007 SOFTLY MY GOOD FRIEND SOFTLY SAID THE YOUTH FALLING BACK ON HIS PILLOW AND LOSING SOME OF THAT COLOR WHICH ALARMED HIS COMPANION I BELIEVE IN EXTRACTING THE BALL YOU DID FOR ME ALL THAT IS REQUIRED I AM FREE FROM PAIN AND ONLY WEAK I DO ASSURE YOU CAPTAIN SINGLETON SAID THE SURGEON WITH HEAT
298-126791-0009 HIS PATIENT SMILED AS HE GENTLY REPULSED HIS PHYSICIAN IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNDO THE BANDAGES AND WITH A RETURNING GLOW TO HIS CHEEKS INQUIRED
298-126791-0010 IF ANYONE INTERFERES WITH MY PATIENTS CRIED THE DOCTOR HASTILY I WILL TEACH THEM SPIRIT OR NO SPIRIT WHAT IT IS TO MEDDLE WITH ANOTHER MAN'S CONCERNS TUT MY DEAR FELLOW THERE WAS NO INTERFERENCE MADE NOR ANY INTENDED SEE EXHIBITING THE BANDAGES
298-126791-0012 AS HE INQUIRED WITH A BREVITY THAT WOULD HAVE HONORED LIEUTENANT MASON HAD IT PETTICOATS GEORGE I SAW NOTHING BUT ITS HEAVENLY EYES ITS BLOOM ITS MAJESTIC STEP ITS GRACE REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN WITH RATHER MORE ARDOR THAN HIS SURGEON THOUGHT CONSISTENT WITH HIS DEBILITATED CONDITION
298-126791-0013 HEM WITH SOMETHING OF THE KIND OF STEP YOU SPEAK OF A VERY COMPLACENT EYE AND AS TO THE BLOOM I DARE SAY OFFICES OF CHARITY CAN SUMMON AS FINE A COLOR TO HER CHEEKS AS GLOWS IN THE FACES OF HER MORE YOUTHFUL NIECES NIECES HAS SHE NIECES THEN
298-126791-0015 THE MAJOR CONSIDERATE DUNWOODIE MURMURED THE EXHAUSTED YOUTH SINKING AGAIN ON HIS PILLOW WHERE THE COMMANDS OF HIS ATTENDANT COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN SILENT EVEN CAPTAIN LAWTON HAD BEEN RECEIVED WITH MANY AND COURTEOUS INQUIRIES AFTER THE STATE OF HIS HEALTH
298-126791-0016 FROM ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY WHEN HE MADE HIS MORNING ENTRANCE BUT AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT PRESIDED OVER THE COMFORTS OF THE ENGLISH COLONEL SARAH HAD SHRUNK WITH CONSCIOUSNESS FROM ENTERING THE ROOM YET SHE KNEW THE POSITION OF EVERY GLASS AND HAD WITH HER OWN HANDS SUPPLIED THE CONTENTS OF EVERY BOWL THAT STOOD ON HIS TABLE
298-126791-0018 IT IS TRUE HE WANTED THE PERSONAL EXCELLENCE OF PEYTON DUNWOODIE BUT HIS PRETENSIONS WERE FAR FROM CONTEMPTIBLE SARAH HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE MORNING CASTING FREQUENT AND LONGING GLANCES AT THE DOOR OF WELLMERE'S APARTMENT ANXIOUS TO LEARN THE CONDITION OF HIS WOUNDS AND YET ASHAMED TO INQUIRE
298-126791-0019 CONSCIOUS INTEREST KEPT HER TONGUE TIED UNTIL HER SISTER WITH THE FRANKNESS OF INNOCENCE HAD PUT THE DESIRED QUESTION TO DOCTOR SITGREAVES COLONEL WELLMERE SAID THE OPERATOR GRAVELY IS IN WHAT I CALL A STATE OF FREE WILL MADAM HE IS ILL OR HE IS WELL AS HE PLEASES
298-126791-0021 HER OWN ROOM HOWEVER AFFORDED HER BUT LITTLE RELIEF AND IN PASSING THROUGH THE LONG GALLERY THAT COMMUNICATED WITH EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF THE BUILDING SHE NOTICED THE DOOR OF SINGLETON'S ROOM TO BE OPEN THE WOUNDED YOUTH SEEMED SLEEPING AND WAS ALONE
298-126791-0022 AND POSSIBLY DREAMING THAT THESE LITTLE FEMININE OFFICES WERE PERFORMED FOR ANOTHER HER NATURAL BLOOM WAS HEIGHTENED BY THE INSINUATION OF THE SURGEON NOR WAS THE LUSTER OF HER EYE IN ANY DEGREE DIMINISHED THE SOUND OF THE APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS OF SITGREAVES HASTENED HER RETREAT DOWN A PRIVATE STAIRWAY TO THE SIDE OF HER SISTER
298-126791-0024 FRANCES FIXED HER LAUGHING EYES ON HER SISTER BUT FORBEARING TO SPEAK THE OTHER READILY CONSTRUED THEIR EXPRESSION AND HASTILY ADDED BUT I FORGET HE IS ONE OF YOUR RENOWNED CORPS OF VIRGINIANS AND MUST BE SPOKEN OF REVERENTLY AS RESPECTFULLY AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR SISTER
298-126791-0025 THERE IS BUT LITTLE DANGER OF EXCEEDING THE TRUTH
298-126791-0027 BUT HE LEAVES HIS ROOM AND THINKS HIS WOUND LIGHTLY PURCHASED BY THE PLEASURE OF BEING WITH HIS FRIENDS IF SHE ADDED WITH A TREMULOUS LIP THIS DREADFUL SUSPICION THAT IS AFFIXED TO HIS VISIT WERE REMOVED I COULD CONSIDER HIS WOUND OF LITTLE MOMENT YOU NOW HAVE THE FRUITS OF REBELLION BROUGHT HOME TO YOU
298-126791-0028 A BROTHER WOUNDED AND A PRISONER AND PERHAPS A VICTIM YOUR FATHER DISTRESSED HIS PRIVACY INTERRUPTED AND NOT IMPROBABLY HIS ESTATES TORN FROM HIM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LOYALTY TO HIS KING FRANCES CONTINUED HER WALK IN SILENCE WHILE FACING THE NORTHERN ENTRANCE TO THE VALE
298-126791-0030 AT LENGTH A SINGLE HORSE CHAISE WAS SEEN MAKING ITS WAY CAREFULLY AMONG THE STONES WHICH LAY SCATTERED OVER THE COUNTRY ROAD THAT WOUND THROUGH THE VALLEY AND APPROACHED THE COTTAGE
298-126791-0031 THE COLOR OF FRANCES CHANGED AS THE VEHICLE GRADUALLY DREW NEARER AND WHEN SHE WAS ENABLED TO SEE A FEMALE FORM IN IT BY THE SIDE OF A BLACK IN LIVERY HER LIMBS SHOOK WITH AN AGITATION THAT COMPELLED HER TO LEAN ON SARAH FOR SUPPORT IN A FEW MINUTES THE TRAVELERS APPROACHED THE GATE
298-126791-0033 STILL FRANCES COULD WITH DIFFICULTY WITHDRAW HER TRUANT EYES FROM THE COUNTENANCE OF THEIR VISITOR SHE WAS YOUNG AND OF A LIGHT AND FRAGILE FORM BUT OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS HER EYES WERE LARGE FULL BLACK PIERCING AND AT TIMES A LITTLE WILD HER HAIR WAS LUXURIANT
298-126791-0034 AND AS IT WAS WITHOUT THE POWDER IT WAS THEN THE FASHION TO WEAR IT FELL IN RAVEN BLACKNESS A FEW OF ITS LOCKS HAD FALLEN ON HER CHEEK GIVING ITS CHILLING WHITENESS BY THE CONTRAST A MORE DEADLY CHARACTER
298-126791-0036 FRANCES HAD STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE ACTION AND FACE OF ISABELLA WITH A KIND OF UNEASY ADMIRATION BUT SHE NOW SPRANG TO HER SIDE WITH THE ARDOR OF A SISTER AND KINDLY DRAWING HER ARM WITHIN HER OWN LED THE WAY TO A RETIRED ROOM
298-126791-0037 THE FEELING WAS COMMUNICATED TO ALL THE SPECTATORS AND THEY DISPERSED IN PURSUIT OF THEIR USUAL AVOCATIONS ISABELLA YIELDED TO THE GENTLE INFLUENCE OF FRANCES WITHOUT RESISTANCE
298-126791-0039 THE SOBS OF MISS SINGLETON FOR A TIME WERE VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE UNTIL WITH AN EVIDENT EXERTION SHE YIELDED TO A KIND OBSERVATION OF HER COMPANION AND SUCCEEDED IN SUPPRESSING HER TEARS RAISING HER FACE TO THE EYES OF FRANCES SHE ROSE
298-126791-0040 MORE COMPOSED THAN HER PREVIOUS AGITATION HAD GIVEN REASON TO EXPECT ISABELLA FOUND HER BROTHER LOOKING BETTER AND IN LESS DANGER THAN HER SENSITIVE IMAGINATION HAD LED HER TO SUPPOSE HER SPIRITS ROSE IN PROPORTION FROM DESPONDENCY SHE PASSED TO SOMETHING LIKE GAYETY
298-126791-0042 IMPELLED BY A CHARM THAT WAS BEYOND HER CONTROL THE YOUTH HAD THROWN AN EARNEST LOOK AT FRANCES AS SOON AS HIS SISTER RAISED HERSELF FROM HIS ARMS AND PERHAPS IT WAS THE FIRST GLANCE AT THE LOVELY LINEAMENTS OF OUR HEROINE
298-126791-0043 WHEN THE GAZER TURNED HIS EYES FROM THE VIEW IN DISAPPOINTMENT HE SEEMED BEWILDERED RUBBED HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A MAN AWAKING FROM A DREAM AND MUSED WHERE IS DUNWOODIE ISABELLA HE SAID THE EXCELLENT FELLOW IS NEVER WEARY OF KIND ACTIONS AFTER A DAY OF SUCH SERVICE AS THAT OF YESTERDAY
298-126791-0045 BUT ISABELLA THE MEETING HAS BEEN TOO MUCH FOR YOU YOU TREMBLE ISABELLA MADE NO REPLY SHE STRETCHED HER HAND TOWARDS THE TABLE WHICH HELD THE NOURISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN AND THE ATTENTIVE FRANCES COMPREHENDED HER WISHES IN A MOMENT A GLASS OF WATER IN SOME MEASURE REVIVED THE SISTER WHO WAS ENABLED TO SAY
298-126791-0046 DOUBTLESS IT IS HIS DUTY TWAS SAID ABOVE A ROYAL PARTY WAS MOVING ON THE RIVER THOUGH I PASSED THE TROOPS BUT TWO MILES FROM THIS SPOT THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE AND IT WAS SPOKEN MORE IN THE MANNER OF A SOLILOQUY THAN AS IF FOR THE EARS OF HER COMPANIONS
298-126791-0048 HIS LOOK WAS CHANGED TO THE FACE OF FRANCES WHO STARTLED BY THE EARNESTNESS OF HIS EXPRESSION AROSE AND HASTILY INQUIRED IF HE WOULD HAVE ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU CAN PARDON THE RUDENESS SAID THE WOUNDED OFFICER MAKING A FEEBLE EFFORT TO RAISE HIS BODY I WOULD REQUEST TO HAVE CAPTAIN LAWTON'S COMPANY FOR A MOMENT
298-126791-0049 FRANCES HASTENED INSTANTLY TO COMMUNICATE HIS WISH TO THAT GENTLEMAN AND IMPELLED BY AN INTEREST SHE COULD NOT CONTROL SHE RETURNED AGAIN TO HER SEAT BY THE SIDE OF MISS SINGLETON LAWTON SAID THE YOUTH IMPATIENTLY AS THE TROOPER ENTERED HEAR YOU FROM THE MAJOR
298-126791-0051 THAT IS A QUESTION THE MAJOR CAN ANSWER BEST BUT YOU KNOW THE REDCOATS ARE ABROAD AND DUNWOODIE COMMANDS IN THE COUNTY THESE ENGLISH MUST BE LOOKED TO TRUE SAID SINGLETON SLOWLY AS IF STRUCK WITH THE OTHER'S REASONS BUT HOW IS IT THAT YOU ARE IDLE WHEN THERE IS WORK TO DO
298-126791-0052 MY SWORD ARM IS NOT IN THE BEST CONDITION AND ROANOKE HAS BUT A SHAMBLING GAIT THIS MORNING BESIDES THERE IS ANOTHER REASON I COULD MENTION IF IT WERE NOT THAT MISS WHARTON WOULD NEVER FORGIVE ME
298-126791-0054 OH AUNT JEANETTE IS EXERTING HERSELF TO DO CREDIT TO MY FATHER'S HOSPITALITY SAID THE LAUGHING GIRL AND I AM A TRUANT FROM HER LABORS AS I SHALL BE A STRANGER TO HER FAVOR UNLESS I PROFFER MY ASSISTANCE
298-126791-0055 FRANCES WITHDREW TO SEEK HER AUNT MUSING DEEPLY ON THE CHARACTER AND EXTREME SENSIBILITY OF THE NEW ACQUAINTANCE CHANCE HAD BROUGHT TO THE COTTAGE THE WOUNDED OFFICER FOLLOWED HER WITH HIS EYES AS SHE MOVED WITH INFANTILE GRACE THROUGH THE DOOR OF HIS APARTMENT AND AS SHE VANISHED FROM HIS VIEW HE OBSERVED
298-126791-0057 BUT IF YOU RECKON DOWNWARD AS IS MOST COMMON I THINK SHE IS NEARER FORTY YOU HAVE MISTAKEN AN ELDER SISTER FOR THE AUNT SAID ISABELLA LAYING HER FAIR HAND ON THE MOUTH OF THE INVALID YOU MUST BE SILENT YOUR FEELINGS ARE BEGINNING TO AFFECT YOUR FRAME
298-126791-0058 THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR SITGREAVES WHO IN SOME ALARM NOTICED THE INCREASE OF FEVERISH SYMPTOMS IN HIS PATIENT ENFORCED THIS MANDATE AND THE TROOPER WITHDREW TO PAY A VISIT OF CONDOLENCE TO ROANOKE WHO HAD BEEN AN EQUAL SUFFERER WITH HIMSELF IN THEIR LAST NIGHT'S SOMERSAULT
298-126791-0060 ORDERS WERE ACCORDINGLY GIVEN TO BE IN READINESS TO REJOIN THE TROOP AT THE FOUR CORNERS AS SOON AS HIS MASTER HAD SHARED IN THE BOUNTY OF THE APPROACHING BANQUET
298-126791-0061 AND BY HIS SYMPATHY SUCCEEDED IN RESTORING THE COLONEL TO HIS OWN GOOD GRACES
298-126791-0063 IN SHORT WHARTON SAID THE COLONEL PUTTING ONE LEG OUT OF BED IT MAY BE CALLED A COMBINATION OF UNTOWARD EVENTS YOUR OWN UNGOVERNABLE HORSE PREVENTED MY ORDERS FROM BEING CARRIED TO THE MAJOR IN SEASON TO FLANK THE REBELS VERY TRUE REPLIED THE CAPTAIN KICKING A SLIPPER TOWARDS THE BED
298-126791-0064 HAD WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING A FEW GOOD FIRES UPON THEM IN FLANK WE SHOULD HAVE SENT THESE BRAVE VIRGINIANS TO THE RIGHT ABOUT AYE AND THAT IN DOUBLE QUICK TIME CRIED THE COLONEL MAKING THE OTHER LEG FOLLOW ITS COMPANION THEN IT WAS NECESSARY TO ROUT THE GUIDES YOU KNOW AND THE MOVEMENT GAVE THEM THE BEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO CHARGE
298-126791-0066 THEY WERE REPULSED YOU SAW IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO DRIVE US FROM THE WOOD AT LEAST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN HAD THEY MADE AN ATTACK SAID THE CAPTAIN THROWING THE REST OF HIS CLOTHES WITHIN REACH OF THE COLONEL
298-126791-0067 TRUE TRUE CRIED THE COLONEL WITH ANIMATION HAD I BEEN THERE TO HAVE IMPROVED THAT ADVANTAGE WE MIGHT HAVE TURNED THE TABLE ON THE YANKEES SAYING WHICH HE DISPLAYED STILL GREATER ANIMATION IN COMPLETING HIS TOILET AND HE WAS SOON PREPARED TO MAKE HIS APPEARANCE FULLY RESTORED TO HIS OWN GOOD OPINION AND FAIRLY PERSUADED THAT HIS CAPTURE WAS OWING TO CASUALTIES ABSOLUTELY BEYOND THE CONTROL OF MAN
302-123504-0001 WHILE IT JABBERED AND GESTICULATED AT SOME ANSWERING CREATURE BEHIND ME THIS OTHER WHICH WAS EVIDENTLY ITS MATE SOON CAME TOWARD US BEARING A MIGHTY STONE CUDGEL
302-123504-0002 WITH WHICH IT EVIDENTLY INTENDED TO BRAIN ME THE CREATURES WERE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN FEET TALL STANDING ERECT AND HAD LIKE THE GREEN MARTIANS AN INTERMEDIARY SET OF ARMS OR LEGS
302-123504-0004 WHEN A BOLT OF MYRIAD LEGGED HORROR HURLED ITSELF THROUGH THE DOORWAY FULL UPON THE BREAST OF MY EXECUTIONER WITH A SHRIEK OF FEAR THE APE WHICH HELD ME LEAPED THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW BUT ITS MATE CLOSED IN A TERRIFIC
302-123504-0005 DEATH STRUGGLE WITH MY PRESERVER WHICH WAS NOTHING LESS THAN MY FAITHFUL WATCH THING I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO CALL SO HIDEOUS A CREATURE A DOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I GAINED MY FEET AND BACKING AGAINST THE WALL I WITNESSED SUCH A
302-123504-0007 MY BEAST HAD AN ADVANTAGE IN HIS FIRST HOLD HAVING SUNK HIS MIGHTY FANGS FAR INTO THE BREAST OF HIS ADVERSARY BUT THE GREAT ARMS AND PAWS OF THE APE
302-123504-0008 BACKED BY MUSCLES FAR TRANSCENDING THOSE OF THE MARTIAN MEN I HAD SEEN HAD LOCKED THE THROAT OF MY GUARDIAN AND SLOWLY WERE CHOKING OUT HIS LIFE AND BENDING BACK HIS HEAD AND NECK UPON HIS BODY
302-123504-0010 BACK AND FORTH UPON THE FLOOR THEY ROLLED NEITHER ONE EMITTING A SOUND OF FEAR OR PAIN PRESENTLY I SAW THE GREAT EYES OF MY BEAST BULGING COMPLETELY FROM THEIR SOCKETS AND BLOOD FLOWING FROM ITS NOSTRILS
302-123504-0011 BUT SO ALSO WAS THE APE WHOSE STRUGGLES WERE GROWING MOMENTARILY LESS SUDDENLY I CAME TO MYSELF
302-123504-0013 SCARCELY HAD THE BLOW DESCENDED WHEN I WAS CONFRONTED WITH A NEW DANGER THE APE'S MATE RECOVERED FROM ITS FIRST SHOCK OF TERROR HAD RETURNED TO THE SCENE OF THE ENCOUNTER BY WAY OF THE INTERIOR OF THE BUILDING
302-123504-0014 I GLIMPSED HIM JUST BEFORE HE REACHED THE DOORWAY AND THE SIGHT OF HIM NOW ROARING AS HE PERCEIVED HIS LIFELESS FELLOW STRETCHED UPON THE FLOOR AND FROTHING AT THE MOUTH IN THE EXTREMITY OF HIS RAGE FILLED ME I MUST CONFESS
302-123504-0016 AGAINST THE IRON MUSCLES AND BRUTAL FEROCITY OF THIS ENRAGED DENIZEN OF AN UNKNOWN WORLD IN FACT THE ONLY OUTCOME OF SUCH AN ENCOUNTER SO FAR AS I MIGHT BE CONCERNED SEEMED SUDDEN DEATH
302-123504-0017 I WAS STANDING NEAR THE WINDOW AND I KNEW THAT ONCE IN THE STREET I MIGHT GAIN THE PLAZA AND SAFETY BEFORE THE CREATURE COULD OVERTAKE ME AT LEAST THERE WAS A CHANCE FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
302-123504-0019 EVEN SHOULD I BREAK ONE OF THEM WITH MY FIRST BLOW FOR I FIGURED THAT HE WOULD ATTEMPT TO WARD OFF THE CUDGEL HE COULD REACH OUT AND ANNIHILATE ME WITH THE OTHERS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER FOR A SECOND ATTACK
302-123504-0020 IN THE INSTANT THAT THESE THOUGHTS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND I HAD TURNED TO MAKE FOR THE WINDOW BUT MY EYES ALIGHTING ON THE FORM OF MY ERSTWHILE GUARDIAN THREW ALL THOUGHTS OF FLIGHT TO THE FOUR WINDS HE LAY GASPING UPON THE FLOOR OF THE CHAMBER
302-123504-0022 AS HE HAD IN MINE WITHOUT MORE ADO THEREFORE I TURNED TO MEET THE CHARGE OF THE INFURIATED BULL APE HE WAS NOW TOO CLOSE UPON ME FOR THE CUDGEL TO PROVE OF ANY EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
302-123504-0023 SO I MERELY THREW IT AS HEAVILY AS I COULD AT HIS ADVANCING BULK IT STRUCK HIM JUST BELOW THE KNEES ELICITING A HOWL OF PAIN AND RAGE AND SO THROWING HIM OFF HIS BALANCE THAT HE LUNGED FULL UPON ME
302-123504-0025 I BEHELD TARS TARKAS SOLA AND THREE OR FOUR WARRIORS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY OF THE CHAMBER AS MY EYES MET THEIRS I WAS FOR THE SECOND TIME THE RECIPIENT OF THEIR ZEALOUSLY GUARDED APPLAUSE
302-123504-0026 MY ABSENCE HAD BEEN NOTED BY SOLA ON HER AWAKENING AND SHE HAD QUICKLY INFORMED TARS TARKAS WHO HAD SET OUT IMMEDIATELY WITH A HANDFUL OF WARRIORS TO SEARCH FOR ME AS THEY HAD APPROACHED THE LIMITS OF THE CITY
302-123504-0028 LOVE OR AFFECTION THESE PEOPLE FAIRLY WORSHIP PHYSICAL PROWESS AND BRAVERY AND NOTHING IS TOO GOOD FOR THE OBJECT OF THEIR ADORATION AS LONG AS HE MAINTAINS HIS POSITION BY REPEATED EXAMPLES OF HIS SKILL
302-123504-0029 STRENGTH AND COURAGE SOLA WHO HAD ACCOMPANIED THE SEARCHING PARTY OF HER OWN VOLITION WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE MARTIANS WHOSE FACE HAD NOT BEEN TWISTED IN LAUGHTER AS I BATTLED FOR MY LIFE SHE ON THE CONTRARY
302-123504-0031 AND TAKING MY HAND STARTED TOWARD THE DOOR OF THE CHAMBER TARS TARKAS AND THE OTHER WARRIORS HAD ENTERED AND WERE STANDING OVER THE NOW RAPIDLY REVIVING BRUTE WHICH HAD SAVED MY LIFE
302-123504-0032 THEY SEEMED TO BE DEEP IN ARGUMENT AND FINALLY ONE OF THEM ADDRESSED ME BUT REMEMBERING MY IGNORANCE OF HIS LANGUAGE TURNED BACK TO TARS TARKAS WHO WITH A WORD AND GESTURE GAVE SOME COMMAND TO THE FELLOW
302-123504-0034 EVIL LOOKING PISTOL FROM ITS HOLSTER AND WAS ON THE POINT OF PUTTING AN END TO THE CREATURE WHEN I SPRANG FORWARD AND STRUCK UP HIS ARM THE BULLET STRIKING THE WOODEN CASING OF THE WINDOW EXPLODED
302-123504-0035 BLOWING A HOLE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE WOOD AND MASONRY I THEN KNELT DOWN BESIDE THE FEARSOME LOOKING THING AND RAISING IT TO ITS FEET MOTIONED FOR IT TO FOLLOW ME
302-123504-0037 HELD IN ITS POOR UGLY CARCASS MORE LOVE MORE LOYALTY MORE GRATITUDE
302-123516-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN CHAINED IN WARHOON IT MUST HAVE BEEN SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE I REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS
302-123516-0002 RISING AND APPROACHING MY COUCH HE SHOULD RENDER RARE SPORT FOR THE GREAT GAMES AND NOW AS MY EYES FELL UPON HIM I SAW THAT HE WAS NO THARK FOR HIS ORNAMENTS AND METAL WERE NOT OF THAT HORDE
302-123516-0003 HE WAS A HUGE FELLOW TERRIBLY SCARRED ABOUT THE FACE AND CHEST AND WITH ONE BROKEN TUSK AND A MISSING EAR
302-123516-0005 AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS WITH THE FEMALE DURING WHICH SHE ASSURED HIM THAT I WAS NOW FULLY FIT TO TRAVEL THE JED ORDERED THAT WE MOUNT AND RIDE AFTER THE MAIN COLUMN
302-123516-0006 I WAS STRAPPED SECURELY TO AS WILD AND UNMANAGEABLE A THOAT AS I HAD EVER SEEN AND WITH A MOUNTED WARRIOR ON EITHER SIDE TO PREVENT THE BEAST FROM BOLTING
302-123516-0008 WHO PROVED TO BE THE JEDDAK OF THE HORDES OF WARHOON LIKE THE JED WHO HAD BROUGHT ME HE WAS FRIGHTFULLY SCARRED AND ALSO DECORATED WITH THE BREASTPLATE OF HUMAN SKULLS AND DRIED DEAD HANDS
302-123516-0009 WHICH SEEMED TO MARK ALL THE GREATER WARRIORS AMONG THE WARHOONS AS WELL AS TO INDICATE THEIR AWFUL FEROCITY WHICH GREATLY TRANSCENDS EVEN THAT OF THE THARKS THE JEDDAK BAR COMAS WHO WAS COMPARATIVELY YOUNG
302-123516-0011 HE ENTIRELY OMITTED THE USUAL FORMAL SALUTATION AS WE ENTERED THE PRESENCE OF THE JEDDAK AND AS HE PUSHED ME ROUGHLY BEFORE THE RULER HE EXCLAIMED IN A LOUD AND MENACING VOICE
302-123516-0012 I HAVE BROUGHT A STRANGE CREATURE WEARING THE METAL OF A THARK WHOM IT IS MY PLEASURE TO HAVE BATTLE WITH A WILD THOAT AT THE GREAT GAMES HE WILL DIE AS BAR COMAS YOUR JEDDAK SEES FIT IF AT ALL
302-123516-0014 RATHER THAN BY A WATER HEARTED WEAKLING FROM WHOM EVEN OLD DAK KOVA COULD TEAR THE METAL WITH HIS BARE HANDS BAR COMAS EYED THE DEFIANT AND INSUBORDINATE CHIEFTAIN FOR AN INSTANT HIS EXPRESSION ONE OF HAUGHTY
302-123516-0015 FEARLESS CONTEMPT AND HATE AND THEN WITHOUT DRAWING A WEAPON AND WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD HE HURLED HIMSELF AT THE THROAT OF HIS DEFAMER
302-123516-0017 BAR COMAS HAD MUCH THE BETTER OF THE BATTLE AS HE WAS STRONGER QUICKER AND MORE INTELLIGENT IT SOON SEEMED THAT THE ENCOUNTER WAS DONE SAVING ONLY THE FINAL DEATH THRUST WHEN BAR COMAS SLIPPED IN
302-123516-0018 BREAKING AWAY FROM A CLINCH IT WAS THE ONE LITTLE OPENING THAT DAK KOVA NEEDED AND HURLING HIMSELF AT THE BODY OF HIS ADVERSARY
302-123516-0020 VICTOR AND VANQUISHED ROLLED LIMP AND LIFELESS UPON THE MOSS A HUGE MASS OF TORN AND BLOODY FLESH
302-123516-0021 BAR COMAS WAS STONE DEAD AND ONLY THE MOST HERCULEAN EFFORTS ON THE PART OF DAK KOVA'S FEMALES SAVED HIM FROM THE FATE HE DESERVED THREE DAYS LATER HE WALKED WITHOUT ASSISTANCE TO THE BODY OF BAR COMAS WHICH
302-123516-0023 THE INJURIES TO DAK KOVA HAD DELAYED THE MARCH SO GREATLY THAT IT WAS DECIDED TO GIVE UP THE EXPEDITION WHICH WAS A RAID UPON A SMALL THARK COMMUNITY IN RETALIATION FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE INCUBATOR UNTIL AFTER THE GREAT GAMES
302-123516-0024 THEY ARE A SMALLER HORDE THAN THE THARKS BUT MUCH MORE FEROCIOUS
302-123516-0026 AND THAT MY MIND DID NOT GIVE WAY TO THE TERRORS OF THAT INKY BLACKNESS HAS BEEN A WONDER TO ME EVER SINCE THE PLACE WAS FILLED WITH CREEPING CRAWLING THINGS COLD SINUOUS BODIES PASSED OVER ME WHEN I LAY DOWN
302-123516-0027 AND IN THE DARKNESS I OCCASIONALLY CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF GLEAMING FIERY EYES FIXED IN HORRIBLE INTENTNESS UPON ME NO SOUND REACHED ME FROM THE WORLD ABOVE AND NO WORD WOULD MY JAILER VOUCHSAFE WHEN MY FOOD WAS BROUGHT TO ME
302-123516-0029 WHO REPRESENTED TO ME THE ENTIRE HORDE OF WARHOONS I HAD NOTICED THAT HE ALWAYS ADVANCED WITH HIS DIM TORCH TO WHERE HE COULD PLACE THE FOOD WITHIN MY REACH AND AS HE STOOPED TO PLACE IT UPON THE FLOOR
302-123516-0030 SO WITH THE CUNNING OF A MADMAN I BACKED INTO THE FAR CORNER OF MY CELL WHEN NEXT I HEARD HIM APPROACHING
302-123516-0032 HE SLIPPED TO THE FLOOR STONE DEAD LAUGHING AND CHATTERING LIKE THE IDIOT I WAS FAST BECOMING
302-123516-0033 NO LONGER WAS I A JIBBERING IDIOT BUT A SANE REASONING MAN WITH THE MEANS OF ESCAPE WITHIN MY VERY HANDS AS I WAS GROPING TO REMOVE THE CHAIN FROM ABOUT MY VICTIM'S NECK
302-123516-0035 AND STEALTHILY ON CAME THE AWFUL EYES UNTIL THEY REACHED THE DEAD BODY AT MY FEET THEN SLOWLY THEY RETREATED BUT THIS TIME WITH A STRANGE GRATING SOUND
302-123523-0000 THE LOOTING OF ZODANGA AS THE GREAT GATE WHERE I STOOD SWUNG OPEN MY FIFTY THARKS HEADED BY TARS TARKAS HIMSELF RODE IN UPON THEIR MIGHTY THOATS I LED THEM TO THE PALACE WALLS
302-123523-0002 AND SOON MY FIERCE ESCORT WAS RIDING ACROSS THE GARDENS OF THE JEDDAK OF ZODANGA AS WE APPROACHED THE PALACE I COULD SEE THROUGH THE GREAT WINDOWS OF THE FIRST FLOOR INTO THE BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED AUDIENCE CHAMBER OF THAN KOSIS
302-123523-0003 THE IMMENSE HALL WAS CROWDED WITH NOBLES AND THEIR WOMEN AS THOUGH SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTION WAS IN PROGRESS THERE WAS NOT A GUARD IN SIGHT WITHOUT THE PALACE DUE I PRESUME TO THE FACT THAT THE CITY AND PALACE WALLS WERE CONSIDERED IMPREGNABLE
302-123523-0005 SURROUNDED BY OFFICERS AND DIGNITARIES OF STATE BEFORE THEM STRETCHED A BROAD AISLE LINED ON EITHER SIDE WITH SOLDIERY AND AS I LOOKED THERE ENTERED THIS AISLE AT THE FAR END OF THE HALL
302-123523-0006 THE HEAD OF A PROCESSION WHICH ADVANCED TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FIRST THERE MARCHED FOUR OFFICERS OF THE JEDDAK'S GUARD BEARING A HUGE SALVER ON WHICH REPOSED UPON A CUSHION OF SCARLET SILK
302-123523-0008 TWO FIGURES ENTIRELY MUFFLED IN SCARLET SILK SO THAT NOT A FEATURE OF EITHER WAS DISCERNIBLE THESE TWO STOPPED AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE FACING THAN KOSIS WHEN THE BALANCE OF THE PROCESSION HAD ENTERED AND ASSUMED THEIR STATIONS
302-123523-0009 THAN KOSIS ADDRESSED THE COUPLE STANDING BEFORE HIM I COULD NOT HEAR HIS WORDS BUT PRESENTLY TWO OFFICERS ADVANCED AND REMOVED THE SCARLET ROBE FROM ONE OF THE FIGURES AND I SAW THAT KANTOS KAN HAD FAILED IN HIS MISSION
302-123523-0011 SPRINGING THE PADLOCK FAST AFTER A FEW MORE WORDS ADDRESSED TO SAB THAN HE TURNED TO THE OTHER FIGURE FROM WHICH THE OFFICERS NOW REMOVED THE ENSHROUDING SILKS DISCLOSING TO MY NOW COMPREHENDING VIEW
302-123523-0012 BUT TO ME IT SEEMED THE MOST FIENDISH SIGHT I HAD EVER WITNESSED AND AS THE ORNAMENTS WERE ADJUSTED UPON HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND HER COLLAR OF GOLD SWUNG OPEN IN THE HANDS OF THAN KOSIS I RAISED MY LONG SWORD ABOVE MY HEAD
302-123523-0014 RODE TARS TARKAS AND HIS FIFTY WARRIORS ON THEIR GREAT THOATS A CRY OF ALARM AND AMAZEMENT BROKE FROM THE ASSEMBLAGE BUT NO WORD OF FEAR AND IN A MOMENT THE SOLDIERS AND NOBLES OF ZODANGA
302-123523-0015 WITH DRAWN LONG SWORD IN AN INSTANT WE WERE ENGAGED AND I FOUND NO MEAN ANTAGONIST AS WE CIRCLED UPON THE BROAD PLATFORM I SAW SAB THAN RUSHING UP THE STEPS TO AID HIS FATHER
302-123523-0017 AND AGAIN WE FACED EACH OTHER HE WAS SOON JOINED BY A QUARTET OF OFFICERS AND WITH MY BACK AGAINST A GOLDEN THRONE I FOUGHT ONCE AGAIN FOR DEJAH THORIS I WAS HARD PRESSED TO DEFEND MYSELF
302-123523-0018 AND WITH HIM MY LAST CHANCE TO WIN THE WOMAN I LOVED MY BLADE WAS SWINGING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHTNING AS I SOUGHT TO PARRY THE THRUSTS AND CUTS OF MY OPPONENTS TWO I HAD DISARMED AND ONE WAS DOWN
302-123523-0020 CALLING TO DEJAH THORIS TO GET BEHIND ME I WORKED MY WAY TOWARD THE LITTLE DOORWAY BACK OF THE THRONE BUT THE OFFICERS REALIZED MY INTENTIONS AND THREE OF THEM SPRANG IN BEHIND ME AND BLOCKED MY CHANCES FOR GAINING A POSITION
302-123523-0021 THE THARKS WERE HAVING THEIR HANDS FULL IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM
302-123523-0023 NOT ONE ATTEMPTED TO ESCAPE AND WHEN THE FIGHTING CEASED IT WAS BECAUSE ONLY THARKS REMAINED ALIVE IN THE GREAT HALL OTHER THAN DEJAH THORIS AND MYSELF SAB THAN LAY DEAD BESIDE HIS FATHER
302-123523-0024 AND THE CORPSES OF THE FLOWER OF ZODANGAN NOBILITY AND CHIVALRY COVERED THE FLOOR OF THE BLOODY SHAMBLES MY FIRST THOUGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER WAS FOR KANTOS KAN
302-123523-0026 I CALLED KANTOS KAN'S NAME ALOUD IN EACH NEW CORRIDOR AND COMPARTMENT AND FINALLY I WAS REWARDED BY HEARING A FAINT RESPONSE GUIDED BY THE SOUND WE SOON FOUND HIM HELPLESS IN A DARK RECESS
302-123523-0027 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT SEEING ME AND TO KNOW THE MEANING OF THE FIGHT FAINT ECHOES OF WHICH HAD REACHED HIS PRISON CELL HE TOLD ME THAT THE AIR PATROL HAD CAPTURED HIM BEFORE HE REACHED THE HIGH TOWER OF THE PALACE
302-123523-0029 FORTUNATELY AMONG THE FIRST I EXAMINED I FOUND HIS JAILER AND SOON WE HAD KANTOS KAN WITH US IN THE THRONE ROOM THE SOUNDS OF HEAVY FIRING MINGLED WITH SHOUTS AND CRIES CAME TO US FROM THE CITY'S STREETS
302-123523-0030 AND TARS TARKAS HASTENED AWAY TO DIRECT THE FIGHTING WITHOUT KANTOS KAN ACCOMPANIED HIM TO ACT AS GUIDE THE GREEN WARRIORS COMMENCING A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PALACE FOR OTHER ZODANGANS AND FOR LOOT AND DEJAH THORIS AND I WERE LEFT ALONE
302-123523-0032 JOINED TOGETHER THE WILD HORDES OF THE SEA BOTTOMS AND BROUGHT THEM TO FIGHT AS ALLIES OF A RED MARTIAN PEOPLE THE ANSWER IS EASY DEJAH THORIS I REPLIED SMILING IT WAS NOT I WHO DID IT IT WAS LOVE
302-123523-0033 LOVE FOR DEJAH THORIS A POWER THAT WOULD WORK GREATER MIRACLES THAN THIS YOU HAVE SEEN A PRETTY FLUSH OVERSPREAD HER FACE AND SHE ANSWERED YOU MAY SAY THAT NOW JOHN CARTER AND I MAY LISTEN
302-123523-0035 BUT NEVER IN MY WILDEST FANCIES HAVE I DREAMED OF WINNING A DEJAH THORIS FOR MYSELF FOR NEVER HAD I DREAMED THAT IN ALL THE UNIVERSE DWELT SUCH A WOMAN AS THE PRINCESS OF HELIUM
302-123523-0036 BUT THAT YOU ARE YOU IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ME DOUBT MY SANITY AS I ASK YOU MY PRINCESS TO BE MINE HE DOES NOT NEED TO BE ABASHED WHO SO WELL KNEW THE ANSWER TO HIS PLEA
302-123523-0038 WITH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION REAPING THEIR TERRIBLE HARVEST AROUND HER DID DEJAH THORIS PRINCESS OF HELIUM TRUE DAUGHTER OF MARS THE GOD OF WAR PROMISE HERSELF IN MARRIAGE TO JOHN CARTER
307-127535-0000 THE COUNCIL OF BUCCANEERS HAD LASTED SOME TIME WHEN ONE OF THEM RE ENTERED THE HOUSE AND WITH A REPETITION OF THE SAME SALUTE WHICH HAD IN MY EYES AN IRONICAL AIR BEGGED FOR A MOMENT'S LOAN OF THE TORCH SILVER BRIEFLY AGREED
307-127535-0002 THE EMBERS OF THE GREAT FIRE HAD SO FAR BURNED THEMSELVES OUT AND NOW GLOWED SO LOW AND DUSKILY THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHY THESE CONSPIRATORS DESIRED A TORCH ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE SLOPE TO THE STOCKADE THEY WERE COLLECTED IN A GROUP

307-127535-0041 THE PRINTED SIDE HAD BEEN BLACKENED WITH WOOD ASH WHICH ALREADY BEGAN TO COME OFF AND SOIL MY FINGERS ON THE BLANK SIDE HAD BEEN WRITTEN WITH THE SAME MATERIAL THE ONE WORD DEPPOSED
307-127535-0042 I HAVE THAT CURIOSITY BESIDE ME AT THIS MOMENT BUT NOT A TRACE OF WRITING NOW REMAINS BEYOND A SINGLE SCRATCH SUCH AS A MAN MIGHT MAKE WITH HIS THUMB NAIL THAT WAS THE END OF THE NIGHT'S BUSINESS
307-127535-0044 AND ABOVE ALL IN THE REMARKABLE GAME THAT I SAW SILVER NOW ENGAGED UPON KEEPING THE MUTINEERS TOGETHER WITH ONE HAND AND GRASPING WITH THE OTHER AFTER EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE AND IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE HIS PEACE AND SAVE HIS MISERABLE LIFE
307-127535-0045 HE HIMSELF SLEPT PEACEFULLY AND SNORED ALOUD YET
307-127539-0001 EVERY THOUGHT OF HIS SOUL HAD BEEN SET FULL STRETCH LIKE A RACER ON THAT MONEY WELL HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN A SINGLE SECOND DEAD AND HE KEPT HIS HEAD FOUND HIS TEMPER AND CHANGED HIS PLAN BEFORE THE OTHERS HAD HAD TIME TO REALIZE THE DISAPPOINTMENT
307-127539-0002 HERE IS A NARROW CORNER AS
307-127539-0004 AND TO DIG WITH THEIR FINGERS THROWING THE BOARDS ASIDE AS THEY DID SO MORGAN FOUND A PIECE OF GOLD HE HELD IT UP WITH A PERFECT SPOUT OF OATHS IT WAS A TWO GUINEA PIECE AND IT WENT FROM HAND TO HAND AMONG THEM FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE
307-127539-0005 TWO GUINEAS ROARED MERRY SHAKING IT AT SILVER
307-127539-0007 AH MERRY REMARKED SILVER STANDING FOR CAP'N AGAIN YOU'RE A PUSHING LAD TO BE SURE BUT THIS TIME EVERYONE WAS ENTIRELY IN MERRY'S FAVOUR THEY BEGAN TO SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0008 DARTING FURIOUS GLANCES BEHIND THEM ONE THING I OBSERVED WHICH LOOKED WELL FOR US THEY ALL GOT OUT UPON THE OPPOSITE SIDE FROM SILVER WELL THERE WE STOOD TWO ON ONE SIDE FIVE ON THE OTHER THE PIT BETWEEN US
307-127539-0010 AT LAST MERRY SEEMED TO THINK A SPEECH MIGHT HELP MATTERS
307-127539-0011 ONE'S THE OLD CRIPPLE THAT BROUGHT US ALL HERE AND BLUNDERED US DOWN TO THIS THE OTHER'S THAT CUB THAT I MEAN TO HAVE THE HEART OF NOW MATES
307-127539-0013 THE MAN WITH THE BANDAGE SPUN ROUND LIKE A TEETOTUM AND FELL ALL HIS LENGTH UPON HIS SIDE WHERE HE LAY DEAD BUT STILL TWITCHING AND THE OTHER THREE TURNED AND RAN FOR IT WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT
307-127539-0014 BEFORE YOU COULD WINK LONG JOHN HAD FIRED TWO BARRELS OF A PISTOL INTO THE STRUGGLING MERRY AND AS THE MAN ROLLED UP HIS EYES AT HIM IN THE LAST AGONY GEORGE SAID HE
307-127539-0016 WAS WORK NO SOUND MAN EVER EQUALLED AND SO THINKS THE DOCTOR AS IT WAS HE WAS ALREADY THIRTY YARDS BEHIND US AND ON THE VERGE OF STRANGLING WHEN WE REACHED THE BROW OF THE SLOPE DOCTOR HE HAILED SEE THERE
307-127539-0017 NO HURRY SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS NO HURRY IN A MORE OPEN PART OF THE PLATEAU WE COULD SEE THE THREE SURVIVORS STILL RUNNING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THEY HAD STARTED
307-127539-0019 CAME SLOWLY UP WITH US THANK YE KINDLY DOCTOR SAYS HE YOU CAME IN IN ABOUT THE NICK I GUESS FOR ME AND HAWKINS
307-127539-0020 I'M BEN GUNN I AM REPLIED THE MAROON WRIGGLING LIKE AN EEL IN HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND HE ADDED AFTER A LONG PAUSE HOW DO MISTER SILVER PRETTY WELL I THANK YE SAYS YOU
307-127539-0022 BEN IN HIS LONG LONELY WANDERINGS ABOUT THE ISLAND HAD FOUND THE SKELETON IT WAS HE THAT HAD RIFLED IT HE HAD FOUND THE TREASURE HE HAD DUG IT UP IT WAS THE HAFT OF HIS PICK AXE THAT LAY BROKEN IN THE EXCAVATION
307-127539-0023 HE HAD CARRIED IT ON HIS BACK IN MANY WEARY JOURNEYS FROM THE FOOT OF THE TALL PINE TO A CAVE HE HAD ON THE TWO POINTED HILL AT THE NORTH EAST ANGLE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IT HAD LAIN STORED IN SAFETY SINCE TWO MONTHS
307-127539-0025 AND KEEP A GUARD UPON THE MONEY AS FOR YOU JIM HE SAID IT WENT AGAINST MY HEART
307-127539-0026 AND LEAVING THE SQUIRE TO GUARD THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN GRAY AND THE MAROON AND STARTED MAKING THE DIAGONAL ACROSS THE ISLAND TO BE AT HAND BESIDE THE PINE SOON HOWEVER HE SAW THAT OUR PARTY HAD THE START OF HIM AND BEN GUNN BEING FLEET OF FOOT
307-127539-0028 NOT A THOUGHT REPLIED DOCTOR LIVESEY CHEERILY AND BY THIS TIME WE HAD REACHED THE GIGS
307-127539-0029 THIS WAS A RUN OF EIGHT OR NINE MILES SILVER THOUGH HE WAS ALMOST KILLED ALREADY WITH FATIGUE WAS SET TO AN OAR LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE WERE SOON SKIMMING SWIFTLY OVER A SMOOTH SEA
307-127539-0031 WHAT SHOULD WE MEET BUT THE HISPANIOLA CRUISING BY HERSELF THE LAST FLOOD HAD LIFTED HER AND HAD THERE BEEN MUCH WIND OR A STRONG TIDE CURRENT AS IN THE SOUTHERN ANCHORAGE WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FOUND HER MORE OR FOUND HER STRANDED BEYOND HELP
307-127539-0032 ANOTHER ANCHOR WAS GOT READY AND DROPPED IN A FATHOM AND A HALF OF WATER WE ALL PULLED ROUND AGAIN TO RUM COVE THE NEAREST POINT FOR BEN GUNN'S TREASURE HOUSE AND THEN GRAY SINGLE HANDED RETURNED WITH THE GIG TO THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0034 TO ME HE WAS CORDIAL AND KIND SAYING NOTHING OF MY ESCAPADE EITHER IN THE WAY OF BLAME OR PRAISE AT SILVER'S POLITE SALUTE HE SOMEWHAT FLUSHED JOHN SILVER
307-127539-0035 REPLIED LONG JOHN AGAIN SALUTING I DARE YOU TO THANK ME CRIED THE SQUIRE IT IS A GROSS DERELICTION OF MY DUTY STAND BACK AND THEREUPON WE ALL ENTERED THE CAVE
307-127539-0037 I BEHELD GREAT HEAPS OF COIN AND QUADRILATERALS BUILT OF BARS OF GOLD THAT WAS FLINT'S TREASURE THAT WE HAD COME SO FAR TO SEEK AND THAT HAD COST ALREADY THE LIVES OF SEVENTEEN MEN FROM THE HISPANIOLA
307-127539-0038 HOW MANY IT HAD COST IN THE AMASSING WHAT BLOOD AND SORROW WHAT GOOD SHIPS SCUTTLED ON THE DEEP WHAT BRAVE MEN WALKING THE PLANK BLINDFOLD WHAT SHOT OF CANNON WHAT SHAME AND LIES AND CRUELTY
307-127539-0040 COME IN JIM SAID THE CAPTAIN YOU'RE A GOOD BOY IN YOUR LINE JIM BUT I DON'T THINK YOU AND ME'LL GO TO SEA AGAIN YOU'RE TOO MUCH OF THE BORN FAVOURITE FOR ME
307-127539-0041 AND WHAT A MEAL IT WAS WITH BEN GUNN'S SALTED GOAT AND SOME DELICACIES AND A BOTTLE OF OLD WINE FROM THE HISPANIOLA NEVER I AM SURE WERE PEOPLE GAYER OR HAPPIER
307-127540-0001 THEREFORE THE WORK WAS PUSHED ON BRISKLY GRAY AND BEN GUNN CAME AND WENT WITH THE BOAT WHILE THE REST DURING THEIR ABSENCES
307-127540-0002 TWO OF THE BARS SLUNG IN A ROPE'S END MADE A GOOD LOAD FOR A GROWN MAN ONE THAT HE WAS GLAD TO WALK SLOWLY WITH FOR MY PART
307-127540-0004 NEARLY EVERY VARIETY OF MONEY IN THE WORLD MUST I THINK HAVE FOUND A PLACE IN THAT COLLECTION AND FOR NUMBER I AM SURE THEY WERE LIKE AUTUMN LEAVES SO THAT MY BACK ACHED WITH STOOPING AND MY FINGERS WITH SORTING THEM OUT
307-127540-0005 AT LAST I THINK IT WAS ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE DOCTOR AND I WERE STROLLING ON THE SHOULDER OF THE HILL WHERE IT OVERLOOKS THE LOWLANDS OF THE ISLE
307-127540-0007 ALL DRUNK SIR STRUCK IN THE VOICE OF SILVER FROM BEHIND US SILVER I SHOULD SAY WAS ALLOWED HIS ENTIRE LIBERTY AND IN SPITE OF DAILY REBUFFS SEEMED TO REGARD HIMSELF ONCE MORE AS QUITE A PRIVILEGED AND FRIENDLY DEPENDENT
307-127540-0008 INDEED IT WAS REMARKABLE HOW WELL HE BORE THESE SLIGHTS AND WITH WHAT UNWEARYING POLITENESS HE KEPT ON TRYING TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH ALL YET I THINK NONE TREATED HIM BETTER THAN A DOG UNLESS IT WAS BEN GUNN
307-127540-0010 FOR I HAD SEEN HIM MEDITATING A FRESH TREACHERY UPON THE PLATEAU ACCORDINGLY IT WAS PRETTY GRUFFLY THAT THE DOCTOR ANSWERED HIM DRUNK OR RAVING SAID HE RIGHT YOU WERE SIR REPLIED SILVER
307-127540-0011 AND PRECIOUS LITTLE ODDS WHICH TO YOU AND ME I SUPPOSE YOU WOULD HARDLY ASK ME TO CALL YOU A HUMANE MAN RETURNED THE DOCTOR WITH A SNEER AND SO MY FEELINGS MAY SURPRISE YOU MASTER SILVER
307-127540-0013 NO SAID THE DOCTOR YOU'RE THE MAN TO KEEP YOUR WORD WE KNOW THAT WELL THAT WAS ABOUT THE LAST NEWS WE HAD OF THE THREE PIRATES ONLY ONCE WE HEARD A GUNSHOT A GREAT WAY OFF AND SUPPOSED THEM TO BE HUNTING
307-127540-0014 A COUNCIL WAS HELD AND IT WAS DECIDED THAT WE MUST DESERT THEM ON THE ISLAND TO THE HUGE GLEE I MUST SAY OF BEN GUNN AND WITH THE STRONG APPROVAL OF GRAY WE LEFT A GOOD STOCK OF POWDER AND SHOT THE BULK OF THE SALT GOAT
307-127540-0016 AND THERE WE SAW ALL THREE OF THEM KNEELING TOGETHER ON A SPIT OF SAND WITH THEIR ARMS RAISED IN SUPPLICATION IT WENT TO ALL OUR HEARTS I THINK TO LEAVE THEM IN THAT WRETCHED STATE BUT WE COULD NOT RISK ANOTHER MUTINY
307-127540-0017 AND TO TAKE THEM HOME FOR THE GIBBET WOULD HAVE BEEN A CRUEL SORT OF KINDNESS THE DOCTOR HAILED THEM AND TOLD THEM OF THE STORES WE HAD LEFT AND WHERE THEY WERE TO FIND THEM BUT THEY CONTINUED TO CALL US BY NAME AND APPEAL TO US FOR GOD'S SAKE
307-127540-0019 AFTER THAT WE KEPT UNDER COVER OF THE BULWARKS AND WHEN NEXT I LOOKED OUT THEY HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE SPIT AND THE SPIT ITSELF HAD ALMOST MELTED OUT OF SIGHT IN THE GROWING DISTANCE THAT WAS AT LEAST THE END OF THAT
307-127540-0020 AND BEFORE NOON TO MY INEXPRESSIBLE JOY THE HIGHEST ROCK OF TREASURE ISLAND HAD SUNK INTO THE BLUE ROUND OF SEA WE WERE SO SHORT OF MEN THAT EVERYONE ON BOARD HAD TO BEAR A HAND
307-127540-0022 AND AS IT WAS WHAT WITH BAFFLING WINDS AND A COUPLE OF FRESH GALES WE WERE ALL WORN OUT BEFORE WE REACHED IT IT WAS JUST AT SUNDOWN WHEN WE CAST ANCHOR IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL LAND LOCKED GULF
307-127540-0023 THE TASTE OF THE TROPICAL FRUITS AND ABOVE ALL THE LIGHTS THAT BEGAN TO SHINE IN THE TOWN MADE A MOST CHARMING CONTRAST TO OUR DARK AND BLOODY SOJOURN ON THE ISLAND AND THE DOCTOR AND THE SQUIRE TAKING ME ALONG WITH THEM WENT ASHORE
307-127540-0025 SILVER WAS GONE THE MAROON HAD CONNIVED AT HIS ESCAPE IN A SHORE BOAT SOME HOURS AGO
307-127540-0026 THAT MAN WITH THE ONE LEG HAD STAYED ABOARD BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL THE SEA COOK HAD NOT GONE EMPTY HANDED HE HAD CUT THROUGH A BULKHEAD UNOBSERVED AND HAD REMOVED ONE OF THE SACKS OF COIN
307-127540-0028 WELL TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT WE GOT A FEW HANDS ON BOARD MADE A GOOD CRUISE HOME AND THE HISPANIOLA REACHED BRISTOL JUST AS MISTER BLANDLY WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF FITTING OUT HER CONSORT FIVE MEN ONLY OF THOSE WHO HAD SAILED RETURNED WITH HER
307-127540-0029 AS THAT OTHER SHIP THEY SANG ABOUT WITH ONE MAN OF HER CREW ALIVE WHAT PUT TO SEA WITH SEVENTY FIVE ALL OF US HAD AN AMPLE SHARE OF THE TREASURE AND USED IT WISELY OR FOOLISHLY ACCORDING TO OUR NATURES
307-127540-0031 MARRIED BESIDES AND THE FATHER OF A FAMILY AS FOR BEN GUNN HE GOT A THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HE SPENT OR LOST IN THREE WEEKS OR TO BE MORE EXACT IN NINETEEN DAYS FOR HE WAS BACK BEGGING ON THE TWENTIETH
307-127540-0032 OF SILVER WE HAVE HEARD NO MORE THAT FORMIDABLE SEAFARING MAN WITH ONE LEG HAS AT LAST GONE CLEAN OUT OF MY LIFE
307-127540-0034 AND THE ARMS STILL LIE FOR ALL THAT I KNOW WHERE FLINT BURIED THEM AND CERTAINLY THEY SHALL LIE THERE FOR ME
307-127540-0035 AND THE WORST DREAMS THAT EVER I HAVE ARE WHEN I HEAR THE SURF BOOMING ABOUT ITS COASTS OR START UPRIGHT IN BED WITH THE SHARP VOICE OF CAPTAIN FLINT STILL RINGING IN MY EARS
311-124404-0001 I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO REFRAIN FROM THIS EXPOSITION AND ONLY MENTION IN GENERAL WHAT THESE TRUTHS ARE THAT THE MORE JUDICIOUS MAY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A MORE SPECIAL ACCOUNT OF THEM WOULD CONDUCE TO THE PUBLIC ADVANTAGE
311-124404-0002 I HAVE EVER REMAINED FIRM IN MY ORIGINAL RESOLUTION TO SUPPOSE NO OTHER PRINCIPLE THAN THAT OF WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY AVAILED MYSELF IN DEMONSTRATING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD AND OF THE SOUL
311-124404-0004 TO SATISFY MYSELF IN A SHORT TIME ON ALL THE PRINCIPAL DIFFICULTIES WHICH ARE USUALLY TREATED OF IN PHILOSOPHY BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED CERTAIN LAWS ESTABLISHED IN NATURE BY GOD IN SUCH A MANNER
311-124404-0005 AND OF WHICH HE HAS IMPRESSED ON OUR MINDS SUCH NOTIONS THAT AFTER WE HAVE REFLECTED SUFFICIENTLY UPON THESE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY ARE ACCURATELY OBSERVED IN ALL THAT EXISTS OR TAKES PLACE IN THE WORLD AND FARTHER BY CONSIDERING
311-124404-0007 FEARING LEST I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMPENSE IN MY DISCOURSE ALL THAT WAS IN MY MIND I RESOLVED TO EXPOUND SINGLY THOUGH AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH MY OPINIONS REGARDING LIGHT THEN
311-124404-0008 TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF ADDING SOMETHING ON THE SUN AND THE FIXED STARS SINCE LIGHT ALMOST WHOLLY PROCEEDS FROM THEM ON THE HEAVENS SINCE THEY TRANSMIT IT ON THE PLANETS COMETS AND EARTH SINCE THEY REFLECT IT AND PARTICULARLY
311-124404-0010 FURTHER TO ENABLE ME TO CAST THIS VARIETY OF SUBJECTS SOMEWHAT INTO THE SHADE AND TO EXPRESS MY JUDGMENT REGARDING THEM WITH GREATER FREEDOM WITHOUT BEING NECESSITATED TO ADOPT OR REFUTE THE OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED
311-124404-0011 I RESOLVED TO LEAVE ALL THE PEOPLE HERE TO THEIR DISPUTES AND TO SPEAK ONLY OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NEW WORLD IF GOD WERE NOW TO CREATE SOMEWHERE IN THE IMAGINARY SPACES
311-124404-0013 AND AFTER THAT DID NOTHING MORE THAN LEND HIS ORDINARY CONCURRENCE TO NATURE AND ALLOW HER TO ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS WHICH HE HAD ESTABLISHED ON THIS SUPPOSITION I IN THE FIRST PLACE DESCRIBED THIS MATTER
311-124404-0014 AND ESSAYED TO REPRESENT IT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT TO MY MIND THERE CAN BE NOTHING CLEARER AND MORE INTELLIGIBLE EXCEPT WHAT HAS BEEN RECENTLY SAID REGARDING GOD AND THE SOUL
311-124404-0016 I ENDEAVORED TO DEMONSTRATE ALL THOSE ABOUT WHICH THERE COULD BE ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT
311-124404-0017 THAT EVEN IF GOD HAD CREATED MORE WORLDS THERE COULD HAVE BEEN NONE IN WHICH THESE LAWS WERE NOT OBSERVED THEREAFTER I SHOWED HOW THE GREATEST PART OF THE MATTER OF THIS CHAOS MUST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE LAWS DISPOSE AND ARRANGE ITSELF IN SUCH A WAY
311-124404-0019 I EXPOUNDED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH WHAT THE NATURE OF THAT LIGHT MUST BE
311-124404-0020 AND HOW THENCE IN AN INSTANT OF TIME IT TRAVERSES THE IMMENSE SPACES OF THE HEAVENS AND HOW FROM THE PLANETS AND COMETS IT IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE EARTH TO THIS I LIKEWISE ADDED MUCH RESPECTING THE SUBSTANCE THE SITUATION THE MOTIONS
311-124404-0022 I CAME NEXT TO SPEAK OF THE EARTH IN PARTICULAR AND TO SHOW HOW EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPRESSLY SUPPOSED THAT GOD HAD GIVEN NO WEIGHT TO THE MATTER OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THIS SHOULD NOT PREVENT ALL ITS PARTS FROM TENDING EXACTLY
311-124404-0023 TO THAT OBSERVED IN OUR SEAS AS ALSO A CERTAIN CURRENT BOTH OF WATER AND AIR FROM EAST TO WEST SUCH AS IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE TROPICS HOW THE MOUNTAINS SEAS FOUNTAINS AND RIVERS MIGHT NATURALLY BE FORMED IN IT
311-124404-0025 I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT FIRE WHICH PRODUCES LIGHT I SPARED NO PAINS TO SET FORTH ALL THAT PERTAINS TO ITS NATURE THE MANNER OF ITS PRODUCTION AND SUPPORT AND TO EXPLAIN HOW HEAT IS SOMETIMES FOUND WITHOUT LIGHT AND LIGHT WITHOUT HEAT
311-124404-0026 TO SHOW HOW IT CAN INDUCE VARIOUS COLORS UPON DIFFERENT BODIES AND OTHER DIVERSE QUALITIES HOW IT REDUCES SOME TO A LIQUID STATE AND HARDENS OTHERS HOW IT CAN CONSUME ALMOST ALL BODIES OR CONVERT THEM INTO ASHES AND SMOKE
311-124404-0028 FOR AS THIS TRANSMUTATION OF ASHES INTO GLASS APPEARED TO ME AS WONDERFUL AS ANY OTHER IN NATURE I TOOK A SPECIAL PLEASURE IN DESCRIBING IT I WAS NOT HOWEVER DISPOSED FROM THESE CIRCUMSTANCES
311-124404-0029 TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS WORLD HAD BEEN CREATED IN THE MANNER I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0031 SO THAT EVEN ALTHOUGH HE HAD FROM THE BEGINNING GIVEN IT NO OTHER FORM THAN THAT OF CHAOS PROVIDED ONLY HE HAD ESTABLISHED CERTAIN LAWS OF NATURE AND HAD LENT IT HIS CONCURRENCE TO ENABLE IT TO ACT AS IT IS WONT TO DO
311-124404-0032 IT MAY BE BELIEVED WITHOUT DISCREDIT TO THE MIRACLE OF CREATION THAT IN THIS WAY ALONE THINGS PURELY MATERIAL MIGHT IN COURSE OF TIME
311-124404-0034 BUT SINCE I HAD NOT AS YET SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE TO ENABLE ME TO TREAT OF THESE IN THE SAME MANNER AS OF THE REST THAT IS TO SAY BY DEDUCING EFFECTS FROM THEIR CAUSES AND BY SHOWING
311-124404-0035 NATURE MUST PRODUCE THEM I REMAINED SATISFIED WITH THE SUPPOSITION THAT GOD FORMED THE BODY OF MAN WHOLLY LIKE TO ONE OF OURS AS WELL IN THE EXTERNAL SHAPE OF THE MEMBERS AS IN THE INTERNAL CONFORMATION OF THE ORGANS
311-124404-0037 AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE HEAT IN HAY THAT HAS BEEN HEAPED TOGETHER BEFORE IT IS DRY OR THAT WHICH CAUSES FERMENTATION IN NEW WINES BEFORE THEY ARE RUN CLEAR OF THE FRUIT FOR WHEN I EXAMINED THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS WHICH MIGHT
311-124404-0038 AS CONSEQUENCES OF THIS SUPPOSITION EXIST IN THIS BODY I FOUND PRECISELY ALL THOSE WHICH MAY EXIST IN US INDEPENDENTLY
311-124404-0040 WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND I DID AFTERWARDS DISCOVER THESE AS SOON AS I SUPPOSED GOD TO HAVE CREATED A RATIONAL SOUL AND TO HAVE ANNEXED IT TO THIS BODY IN A PARTICULAR MANNER WHICH I DESCRIBED
311-124404-0041 WILL AFFORD THE MEANS OF READILY DETERMINING WHAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF ALL THE REST
311-124404-0043 AND TO HAVE SHOWN TO THEM ITS TWO VENTRICLES OR CAVITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IN THE RIGHT SIDE WITH WHICH CORRESPOND TWO VERY AMPLE TUBES VIZ THE HOLLOW VEIN VENA CAVA
311-124404-0044 WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL RECEPTACLE OF THE BLOOD AND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AS IT WERE OF WHICH ALL THE OTHER VEINS IN THE BODY ARE BRANCHES AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN VENA ARTERIOSA INAPPROPRIATELY SO DENOMINATED
311-124404-0046 TWO CANALS IN SIZE EQUAL TO OR LARGER THAN THE PRECEDING VIZ THE VENOUS ARTERY ARTERIA VENOSA LIKEWISE INAPPROPRIATELY THUS DESIGNATED BECAUSE IT IS SIMPLY A VEIN WHICH COMES FROM THE LUNGS
311-124404-0047 WHERE IT IS DIVIDED INTO MANY BRANCHES INTERLACED WITH THOSE OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND THOSE OF THE TUBE CALLED THE WINDPIPE THROUGH WHICH THE AIR WE BREATHE ENTERS AND THE GREAT ARTERY WHICH ISSUING FROM THE HEART SENDS ITS BRANCHES ALL OVER THE BODY
311-124404-0049 THREE AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE HOLLOW VEINS WHERE THEY ARE DISPOSED IN SUCH A MANNER AS BY NO MEANS TO PREVENT THE BLOOD WHICH IT CONTAINS FROM FLOWING INTO THE RIGHT VENTRICLE OF THE HEART AND YET EXACTLY TO PREVENT ITS FLOWING OUT THREE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE ARTERIAL VEIN
311-124404-0050 WHICH ARRANGED IN A MANNER EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF THE FORMER READILY PERMIT THE BLOOD CONTAINED IN THIS CAVITY TO PASS INTO THE LUNGS BUT HINDER THAT CONTAINED IN THE LUNGS FROM RETURNING TO THIS CAVITY AND IN LIKE MANNER
311-124404-0052 BUT PREVENT ITS REFLUX NOR DO WE NEED TO SEEK ANY OTHER REASON FOR THE NUMBER OF THESE PELLICLES BEYOND THIS THAT THE ORIFICE OF THE VENOUS ARTERY BEING OF AN OVAL SHAPE FROM THE NATURE OF ITS SITUATION CAN BE ADEQUATELY CLOSED WITH TWO
311-124404-0053 WHEREAS THE OTHERS BEING ROUND ARE MORE CONVENIENTLY CLOSED WITH THREE BESIDES I WISH SUCH PERSONS TO OBSERVE THAT THE GRAND ARTERY AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN ARE OF MUCH HARDER AND FIRMER TEXTURE
311-124404-0055 AND FINALLY THAT THIS HEAT IS CAPABLE OF CAUSING ANY DROP OF BLOOD THAT PASSES INTO THE CAVITIES RAPIDLY TO EXPAND AND DILATE JUST AS ALL LIQUORS DO WHEN ALLOWED TO FALL DROP BY DROP INTO A HIGHLY HEATED VESSEL
311-124404-0056 FOR AFTER THESE THINGS IT IS NOT NECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING MORE WITH A VIEW TO EXPLAIN THE MOTION OF THE HEART EXCEPT THAT WHEN ITS CAVITIES ARE NOT FULL OF BLOOD
311-124404-0058 BECAUSE THE ORIFICES THROUGH WHICH THEY PASS ARE WIDE
311-124404-0059 ARE IMMEDIATELY RAREFIED AND DILATED BY THE HEAT THEY MEET WITH IN THIS WAY THEY CAUSE THE WHOLE HEART TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME PRESS HOME AND SHUT THE FIVE SMALL VALVES THAT ARE AT THE ENTRANCES
311-124404-0061 CAUSING IN THIS WAY ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE ARTERIAL VEIN AND OF THE GRAND ARTERY TO EXPAND ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THE HEART WHICH IMMEDIATELY THEREAFTER BEGINS TO CONTRACT AS DO ALSO THE ARTERIES
311-124404-0062 AND THE SIX SMALL VALVES CLOSE AND THE FIVE OF THE HOLLOW
311-124404-0064 WHICH CAUSE THE HEART AND THE ARTERIES AGAIN TO EXPAND AS BEFORE AND BECAUSE THE BLOOD WHICH THUS ENTERS INTO THE HEART PASSES
311-124404-0065 IT THENCE HAPPENS THAT THEIR MOTION IS THE CONTRARY OF THAT OF THE HEART AND THAT WHEN IT EXPANDS THEY CONTRACT BUT LEST THOSE WHO ARE IGNORANT OF THE FORCE OF MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS AND WHO ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DISTINGUISH
311-124404-0067 FROM THE VERY ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WHICH MAY BE OBSERVED IN THE HEART BY THE EYE ALONE AND FROM THE HEAT WHICH MAY BE FELT WITH THE FINGERS AND FROM THE NATURE OF THE BLOOD AS LEARNED FROM EXPERIENCE AS DOES THE MOTION OF A CLOCK FROM THE POWER
311-124404-0068 THE SITUATION AND SHAPE OF ITS COUNTERWEIGHTS AND WHEELS BUT IF IT BE ASKED HOW IT HAPPENS THAT THE BLOOD IN THE VEINS FLOWING IN THIS WAY CONTINUALLY INTO THE HEART IS NOT EXHAUSTED
311-124404-0070 SO THAT ITS COURSE AMOUNTS PRECISELY TO A PERPETUAL CIRCULATION OF THIS WE HAVE ABUNDANT PROOF IN THE ORDINARY EXPERIENCE OF SURGEONS WHO BY BINDING THE ARM WITH A TIE OF MODERATE STRAITNESS ABOVE THE PART WHERE THEY OPEN THE VEIN
311-124404-0071 CAUSE THE BLOOD TO FLOW MORE COPIOUSLY THAN IT WOULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT ANY LIGATURE WHEREAS QUITE THE CONTRARY WOULD HAPPEN WERE THEY TO BIND IT BELOW THAT IS BETWEEN THE HAND AND THE OPENING OR WERE TO MAKE THE LIGATURE ABOVE
311-124404-0073 FROM COMING FORWARD THROUGH THE ARTERIES BECAUSE THESE ARE SITUATED BELOW THE VEINS AND THEIR COVERINGS FROM THEIR GREATER CONSISTENCY ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO COMPRESS AND ALSO THAT THE BLOOD WHICH COMES FROM THE HEART TENDS TO PASS THROUGH THEM
311-124404-0074 TO THE HAND WITH GREATER FORCE THAN IT DOES TO RETURN FROM THE HAND TO THE HEART THROUGH THE VEINS AND SINCE THE LATTER CURRENT ESCAPES FROM THE ARM BY THE OPENING MADE IN ONE OF THE VEINS THERE MUST OF NECESSITY
311-124404-0076 SO AS TO PREVENT THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE BLOOD FLOWING OUT OF IT COULD COME FROM ANY OTHER QUARTER THAN THE HEART BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH EVINCE THAT WHAT I HAVE ALLEGED
311-124404-0077 IS THE TRUE CAUSE OF THE MOTION OF THE BLOOD THUS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE BLOOD WHICH FLOWS FROM THE VEINS AND THAT FROM THE ARTERIES CAN ONLY ARISE FROM THIS
311-124404-0079 AND IF ATTENTION BE GIVEN IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THIS DIFFERENCE IS VERY MARKED ONLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE HEART
311-124404-0080 IN PARTS MORE REMOTE FROM IT IN THE NEXT PLACE
311-124404-0082 AND THE ARTERIAL VEIN WERE IT NOT THAT THE BLOOD OF THE VENOUS ARTERY HAVING ONLY BEEN IN THE LUNGS AFTER IT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE HEART IS THINNER AND RAREFIES MORE READILY AND IN A HIGHER DEGREE
311-124404-0083 WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT IF THE BLOOD BE WITHDRAWN FROM ANY PART THE HEAT IS LIKEWISE WITHDRAWN BY THE SAME MEANS AND ALTHOUGH THE HEART WERE AS HOT AS GLOWING IRON IT WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF WARMING THE FEET AND HANDS
311-124404-0085 WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT IT IS DISTILLED BY PASSING AND REPASSING THROUGH THE HEART PERHAPS MORE THAN ONE OR TWO HUNDRED TIMES IN A DAY
311-124404-0086 AND THE PRODUCTION OF THE DIFFERENT HUMORS OF THE BODY BEYOND SAYING THAT THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE BLOOD IN BEING RAREFIED PASSES FROM THE HEART TOWARDS THE EXTREMITIES OF THE ARTERIES CAUSES CERTAIN OF ITS PARTS TO REMAIN IN THE MEMBERS AT WHICH THEY ARRIVE
311-124404-0088 WHICH BY BEING VARIOUSLY PERFORATED SERVE TO SEPARATE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GRAIN AND IN THE LAST PLACE WHAT ABOVE ALL IS HERE WORTHY OF OBSERVATION
311-124404-0089 IS THE GENERATION OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH ARE LIKE A VERY SUBTLE WIND OR RATHER A VERY PURE AND VIVID FLAME WHICH
311-124404-0091 PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE BRAIN IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SUPPOSE ANY OTHER CAUSE THAN SIMPLY THAT THE ARTERIES WHICH CARRY THEM THITHER PROCEED FROM THE HEART
311-124404-0092 IN THE MOST DIRECT LINES AND THAT ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF MECHANICS WHICH ARE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF NATURE WHEN MANY OBJECTS TEND AT ONCE TO THE SAME POINT
311-124404-0094 I HAD EXPOUNDED ALL THESE MATTERS WITH SUFFICIENT MINUTENESS IN THE TREATISE WHICH I FORMERLY THOUGHT OF PUBLISHING AND AFTER THESE I HAD SHOWN WHAT MUST BE THE FABRIC OF THE NERVES AND MUSCLES OF THE HUMAN BODY
311-124404-0095 TO GIVE THE ANIMAL SPIRITS CONTAINED IN IT THE POWER TO MOVE THE MEMBERS AS WHEN WE SEE HEADS SHORTLY AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN STRUCK OFF STILL MOVE AND BITE THE EARTH ALTHOUGH NO LONGER ANIMATED WHAT CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE IN THE BRAIN TO PRODUCE
311-124404-0097 THIRST AND THE OTHER INTERNAL AFFECTIONS CAN LIKEWISE IMPRESS UPON IT DIVERS IDEAS WHAT MUST BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE COMMON SENSE SENSUS COMMUNIS IN WHICH THESE IDEAS ARE RECEIVED BY THE MEMORY WHICH RETAINS THEM
311-124404-0098 BY THE FANTASY WHICH CAN CHANGE THEM IN VARIOUS WAYS AND OUT OF THEM COMPOSE NEW IDEAS AND WHICH BY THE SAME MEANS DISTRIBUTING THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE MUSCLES CAN CAUSE THE MEMBERS OF SUCH A BODY TO MOVE IN AS MANY DIFFERENT WAYS
311-124404-0100 MUSCLES NERVES ARTERIES VEINS AND OTHER PARTS THAT ARE FOUND IN THE BODY OF EACH ANIMAL SUCH PERSONS WILL LOOK UPON THIS BODY AS A MACHINE MADE BY THE HANDS OF GOD WHICH IS INCOMPARABLY BETTER ARRANGED
311-124404-0101 AND ADEQUATE TO MOVEMENTS MORE ADMIRABLE THAN IS ANY MACHINE OF HUMAN INVENTION AND HERE I SPECIALLY STAYED TO SHOW THAT WERE THERE SUCH MACHINES EXACTLY RESEMBLING ORGANS AND OUTWARD FORM AN APE OR ANY OTHER IRRATIONAL ANIMAL
311-124404-0103 OUR THOUGHTS TO OTHERS FOR WE MAY EASILY CONCEIVE A MACHINE TO BE SO CONSTRUCTED THAT IT EMITS VOCABLES AND EVEN THAT IT EMITS SOME CORRESPONDENT TO THE ACTION UPON IT OF EXTERNAL OBJECTS WHICH CAUSE A CHANGE IN ITS ORGANS
311-124404-0104 FOR EXAMPLE IF TOUCHED IN A PARTICULAR PLACE IT MAY DEMAND WHAT WE WISH TO SAY TO IT IF IN ANOTHER IT MAY CRY OUT THAT IT IS HURT AND SUCH LIKE
311-124404-0106 THESE ORGANS ON THE CONTRARY NEED A PARTICULAR ARRANGEMENT FOR EACH PARTICULAR ACTION WHENCE IT MUST BE MORALLY IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD EXIST IN ANY MACHINE A DIVERSITY OF ORGANS SUFFICIENT
311-124404-0107 THAT THERE ARE NO MEN SO DULL AND STUPID NOT EVEN IDIOTS AS TO BE INCAPABLE OF JOINING TOGETHER DIFFERENT WORDS AND THEREBY CONSTRUCTING A DECLARATION BY WHICH TO MAKE THEIR THOUGHTS UNDERSTOOD
311-124404-0109 AND THIS PROVES NOT ONLY THAT THE BRUTES HAVE LESS REASON THAN MAN BUT THAT THEY HAVE NONE AT ALL FOR WE SEE THAT VERY LITTLE IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE A PERSON TO SPEAK
311-124404-0110 AND SINCE A CERTAIN INEQUALITY OF CAPACITY IS OBSERVABLE AMONG ANIMALS OF THE SAME SPECIES AS WELL AS AMONG MEN AND SINCE SOME ARE MORE CAPABLE OF BEING INSTRUCTED THAN OTHERS IT IS INCREDIBLE THAT THE MOST PERFECT APE OR PARROT OF ITS SPECIES
311-124404-0112 AND WE OUGHT NOT TO CONFOUND SPEECH WITH THE NATURAL MOVEMENTS WHICH INDICATE THE PASSIONS AND CAN BE IMITATED BY MACHINES AS WELL AS MANIFESTED BY ANIMALS NOR MUST IT BE THOUGHT WITH CERTAIN OF THE ANCIENTS THAT THE BRUTES SPEAK ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE
311-124404-0113 SINCE THEY ARE ENDOWED WITH MANY ORGANS ANALOGOUS TO OURS THEY COULD AS EASILY COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US AS TO THEIR FELLOWS
311-124404-0115 AND COULD SURPASS US IN ALL THINGS ON THE CONTRARY IT RATHER PROVES THAT THEY ARE DESTITUTE OF REASON AND THAT IT IS NATURE WHICH ACTS IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE DISPOSITION OF THEIR ORGANS THUS IT IS SEEN THAT A CLOCK COMPOSED ONLY OF WHEELS AND WEIGHTS
311-124404-0116 CAN NUMBER THE HOURS AND MEASURE TIME MORE EXACTLY THAN WE WITH ALL OUR SKIN I HAD AFTER THIS DESCRIBED THE REASONABLE SOUL AND SHOWN THAT IT COULD BY NO MEANS BE EDUCED FROM THE POWER OF MATTER
311-124404-0118 BUT THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE JOINED AND UNITED MORE CLOSELY TO THE BODY IN ORDER TO HAVE SENSATIONS AND APPETITES SIMILAR TO OURS AND THUS CONSTITUTE A REAL MAN
311-124404-0119 THERE IS NONE THAT IS MORE POWERFUL IN LEADING FEEBLE MINDS ASTRAY FROM THE STRAIGHT PATH OF VIRTUE
311-124404-0121 BECAUSE NO OTHER CAUSES ARE OBSERVED CAPABLE OF DESTROYING IT
322-124146-0000 MISTER COLLINS WAS NOT LEFT LONG TO THE SILENT CONTEMPLATION OF HIS SUCCESSFUL LOVE FOR MISSUS BENNET HAVING DAWDLED ABOUT IN THE VESTIBULE TO WATCH FOR THE END OF THE CONFERENCE NO SOONER SAW ELIZABETH OPEN THE DOOR
322-124146-0002 MISTER COLLINS RECEIVED AND RETURNED THESE FELICITATIONS WITH EQUAL PLEASURE AND THEN PROCEEDED TO RELATE THE PARTICULARS OF THEIR INTERVIEW WITH THE RESULT OF WHICH HE TRUSTED HE HAD EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED
322-124146-0003 SINCE THE REFUSAL WHICH HIS COUSIN HAD STEADFASTLY GIVEN HIM WOULD NATURALLY FLOW FROM HER BASHFUL MODESTY AND THE GENUINE DELICACY OF HER CHARACTER THIS INFORMATION HOWEVER STARTLED MISSUS BENNET
322-124146-0005 SHE ADDED THAT LIZZY SHALL BE BROUGHT TO REASON
322-124146-0006 SHE IS A VERY HEADSTRONG FOOLISH GIRL AND DOES NOT KNOW HER OWN INTEREST BUT I WILL MAKE HER KNOW IT PARDON ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU MADAM CRIED MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0008 IF THEREFORE SHE ACTUALLY PERSISTS IN REJECTING MY SUIT PERHAPS IT WERE BETTER NOT TO FORCE HER INTO ACCEPTING ME BECAUSE IF LIABLE TO SUCH DEFECTS OF TEMPER SHE COULD NOT CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO MY FELICITY
322-124146-0009 SIR YOU QUITE MISUNDERSTAND ME SAID MISSUS BENNET ALARMED LIZZY IS ONLY HEADSTRONG IN SUCH MATTERS AS THESE IN EVERYTHING ELSE SHE IS AS GOOD NATURED A GIRL AS EVER LIVED
322-124146-0011 I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF UNDERSTANDING YOU SAID HE
322-124146-0012 YOUR MOTHER INSISTS UPON YOUR ACCEPTING IT IS IT NOT SO MISSUS BENNET YES OR I WILL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN AN UNHAPPY ALTERNATIVE IS BEFORE YOU ELIZABETH
322-124146-0014 MY DEAR REPLIED HER HUSBAND I HAVE TWO SMALL FAVOURS TO REQUEST FIRST THAT YOU WILL ALLOW ME THE FREE USE OF MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE PRESENT OCCASION AND SECONDLY
322-124146-0015 OF MY ROOM I SHALL BE GLAD TO HAVE THE LIBRARY TO MYSELF AS SOON AS MAY BE NOT YET HOWEVER IN SPITE OF HER DISAPPOINTMENT IN HER HUSBAND DID MISSUS BENNET GIVE UP THE POINT
322-124146-0017 AND ELIZABETH SOMETIMES WITH REAL EARNESTNESS AND SOMETIMES WITH PLAYFUL GAIETY REPLIED TO HER ATTACKS THOUGH HER MANNER VARIED HOWEVER HER DETERMINATION NEVER DID
322-124146-0018 MISTER COLLINS MEANWHILE WAS MEDITATING IN SOLITUDE ON WHAT HAD PASSED HE THOUGHT TOO WELL OF HIMSELF TO COMPREHEND ON WHAT MOTIVES HIS COUSIN COULD REFUSE HIM AND THOUGH HIS PRIDE WAS HURT
322-124146-0020 I AM GLAD YOU ARE COME FOR THERE IS SUCH FUN HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS HAPPENED THIS MORNING
322-124146-0021 WHO CAME TO TELL THE SAME NEWS AND NO SOONER HAD THEY ENTERED THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE MISSUS BENNET WAS ALONE THAN SHE LIKEWISE BEGAN ON THE SUBJECT CALLING ON MISS LUCAS FOR HER COMPASSION
322-124146-0023 I HAVE NO PLEASURE IN TALKING TO UNDUTIFUL CHILDREN
322-124146-0024 WHO SUFFER AS I DO FROM NERVOUS COMPLAINTS CAN HAVE NO GREAT INCLINATION FOR TALKING
322-124146-0026 WOULD ONLY INCREASE THE IRRITATION SHE TALKED ON THEREFORE WITHOUT INTERRUPTION FROM ANY OF THEM TILL THEY WERE JOINED BY MISTER COLLINS
322-124146-0027 AND ON PERCEIVING WHOM SHE SAID TO THE GIRLS
322-124146-0029 DETAINED FIRST BY THE CIVILITY OF MISTER COLLINS WHOSE INQUIRIES AFTER HERSELF AND ALL HER FAMILY WERE VERY MINUTE AND THEN BY A LITTLE CURIOSITY SATISFIED HERSELF WITH WALKING TO THE WINDOW AND PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR
322-124146-0030 MY DEAR MADAM REPLIED HE LET US BE FOR EVER SILENT ON THIS POINT FAR BE IT FROM ME HE PRESENTLY CONTINUED
322-124146-0032 WHO HAS BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS I HAVE BEEN IN EARLY PREFERMENT AND I TRUST I AM RESIGNED
322-124146-0033 HAD MY FAIR COUSIN HONOURED ME WITH HER HAND FOR I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED THAT RESIGNATION IS NEVER SO PERFECT AS WHEN THE BLESSING DENIED BEGINS TO LOSE SOMEWHAT OF ITS VALUE IN OUR ESTIMATION
322-124146-0035 MY CONDUCT MAY I FEAR BE OBJECTIONABLE IN HAVING ACCEPTED MY DISMISSION FROM YOUR DAUGHTER'S LIPS INSTEAD OF YOUR OWN BUT WE ARE ALL LIABLE TO ERROR
322-124146-0036 I HAVE CERTAINLY MEANT WELL THROUGH THE WHOLE AFFAIR MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO SECURE AN AMIABLE COMPANION FOR MYSELF
322-124147-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE DISCUSSION OF MISTER COLLINS'S OFFER WAS NOW NEARLY AT AN END AND ELIZABETH HAD ONLY TO SUFFER FROM THE UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS NECESSARILY ATTENDING IT
322-124147-0001 AND OCCASIONALLY FROM SOME PEEVISH ALLUSIONS OF HER MOTHER AS FOR THE GENTLEMAN HIMSELF HIS FEELINGS WERE CHIEFLY EXPRESSED NOT BY EMBARRASSMENT OR DEJECTION OR BY TRYING TO AVOID HER
322-124147-0003 MISTER COLLINS WAS ALSO IN THE SAME STATE OF ANGRY PRIDE ELIZABETH HAD HOPED THAT HIS RESENTMENT MIGHT SHORTEN HIS VISIT BUT HIS PLAN DID NOT APPEAR IN THE LEAST AFFECTED BY IT HE WAS ALWAYS TO HAVE GONE ON SATURDAY
322-124147-0004 AFTER BREAKFAST THE GIRLS WALKED TO MERYTON TO INQUIRE IF MISTER WICKHAM WERE RETURNED AND TO LAMENT OVER HIS ABSENCE FROM THE NETHERFIELD BALL HE JOINED THEM ON THEIR ENTERING THE TOWN
322-124147-0006 TO ELIZABETH HOWEVER HE VOLUNTARILY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE NECESSITY OF HIS ABSENCE HAD BEEN SELF IMPOSED I FOUND SAID HE AS THE TIME DREW NEAR
322-124147-0007 THAT I HAD BETTER NOT MEET MISTER DARCY THAT TO BE IN THE SAME ROOM THE SAME PARTY WITH HIM FOR SO MANY HOURS TOGETHER MIGHT BE MORE THAN I COULD BEAR AND THAT SCENES MIGHT ARISE UNPLEASANT TO MORE THAN MYSELF
322-124147-0009 THE ENVELOPE CONTAINED A SHEET OF ELEGANT LITTLE HOT PRESSED PAPER WELL COVERED WITH A LADY'S FAIR FLOWING HAND AND ELIZABETH SAW HER SISTER'S COUNTENANCE CHANGE AS SHE READ IT
322-124147-0010 AND SAW HER DWELLING INTENTLY ON SOME PARTICULAR PASSAGES JANE RECOLLECTED HERSELF SOON AND PUTTING THE LETTER AWAY TRIED TO JOIN WITH HER USUAL CHEERFULNESS IN THE GENERAL CONVERSATION
322-124147-0012 IT IS UNLUCKY SAID SHE AFTER A SHORT PAUSE THAT YOU SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS BEFORE THEY LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT MAY WE NOT HOPE THAT THE PERIOD OF FUTURE HAPPINESS
322-124147-0013 TO WHICH MISS BINGLEY LOOKS FORWARD MAY ARRIVE EARLIER THAN SHE IS AWARE AND THAT THE DELIGHTFUL INTERCOURSE YOU HAVE KNOWN AS FRIENDS WILL BE RENEWED WITH YET GREATER SATISFACTION AS SISTERS MISTER BINGLEY WILL NOT BE DETAINED IN LONDON BY THEM
322-124147-0015 HE IMAGINED THAT THE BUSINESS WHICH TOOK HIM TO LONDON MIGHT BE CONCLUDED IN THREE OR FOUR DAYS BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN IT CANNOT BE SO AND AT THE SAME TIME CONVINCED THAT WHEN CHARLES GETS TO TOWN HE WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE IT AGAIN
322-124147-0016 AS TO PREVENT YOUR FEELING THE LOSS OF THE THREE OF WHOM WE SHALL DEPRIVE YOU IT IS EVIDENT BY THIS ADDED JANE THAT HE COMES BACK NO MORE THIS WINTER
322-124147-0018 I WILL HAVE NO RESERVES FROM YOU
322-124147-0019 AND TO CONFESS THE TRUTH WE ARE SCARCELY LESS EAGER TO MEET HER AGAIN I REALLY DO NOT THINK GEORGIANA DARCY HAS HER EQUAL FOR BEAUTY ELEGANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE AFFECTION SHE INSPIRES IN LOUISA AND MYSELF
322-124147-0021 HE WILL HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITY NOW OF SEEING HER ON THE MOST INTIMATE FOOTING HER RELATIONS ALL WISH THE CONNECTION AS MUCH AS HIS OWN AND A SISTER'S PARTIALITY IS NOT MISLEADING ME I THINK
322-124147-0022 WHEN I CALL CHARLES MOST CAPABLE OF ENGAGING ANY WOMAN'S HEART WITH ALL THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO FAVOUR AN ATTACHMENT AND NOTHING TO PREVENT IT AM I WRONG MY DEAREST JANE
322-124147-0024 SAID JANE AS SHE FINISHED IT IS IT NOT CLEAR ENOUGH DOES IT NOT EXPRESSLY DECLARE THAT CAROLINE NEITHER EXPECTS NOR WISHES ME TO BE HER SISTER THAT SHE IS PERFECTLY CONVINCED OF HER BROTHER'S INDIFFERENCE
322-124147-0025 AND THAT IF SHE SUSPECTS THE NATURE OF MY FEELINGS FOR HIM SHE MEANS MOST KINDLY TO PUT ME ON MY GUARD CAN THERE BE ANY OTHER OPINION ON THE SUBJECT YES THERE CAN
322-124147-0027 SHE FOLLOWS HIM TO TOWN IN HOPE OF KEEPING HIM THERE AND TRIES TO PERSUADE YOU THAT HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU JANE SHOOK HER HEAD INDEED JANE YOU OUGHT TO BELIEVE ME
322-124147-0028 NO ONE WHO HAS EVER SEEN YOU TOGETHER CAN DOUBT HIS AFFECTION MISS BINGLEY I AM SURE CANNOT SHE IS NOT SUCH A SIMPLETON COULD SHE HAVE SEEN HALF AS MUCH LOVE IN MISTER DARCY FOR HERSELF
322-124147-0030 IN WHICH THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME INGENUITY AND I DARE SAY IT WOULD SUCCEED IF MISS DE BOURGH WERE OUT OF THE WAY BUT MY DEAREST JANE YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY IMAGINE
322-124147-0031 THAT BECAUSE MISS BINGLEY TELLS YOU HER BROTHER GREATLY ADMIRES MISS DARCY HE IS IN THE SMALLEST DEGREE LESS SENSIBLE OF YOUR MERIT THAN WHEN HE TOOK LEAVE OF YOU ON TUESDAY OR THAT IT WILL BE IN HER POWER TO PERSUADE HIM THAT INSTEAD OF BEING IN LOVE WITH YOU
322-124147-0033 IS THAT SHE IS DECEIVING HERSELF THAT IS RIGHT YOU COULD NOT HAVE STARTED A MORE HAPPY IDEA SINCE YOU WILL NOT TAKE COMFORT IN MINE BELIEVE HER TO BE DECEIVED BY ALL MEANS
322-124147-0034 EVEN SUPPOSING THE BEST IN ACCEPTING A MAN WHOSE SISTERS AND FRIENDS ARE ALL WISHING HIM TO MARRY ELSEWHERE YOU MUST DECIDE FOR YOURSELF SAID ELIZABETH
322-124147-0036 THE IDEA OF HIS RETURNING NO MORE ELIZABETH TREATED WITH THE UTMOST CONTEMPT IT APPEARED TO HER MERELY THE SUGGESTION OF CAROLINE'S INTERESTED WISHES AND SHE COULD NOT FOR A MOMENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE WISHES
322-124147-0037 HOWEVER OPENLY OR ARTFULLY SPOKEN COULD INFLUENCE A YOUNG MAN SO TOTALLY INDEPENDENT OF EVERYONE SHE REPRESENTED TO HER SISTER AS FORCIBLY AS POSSIBLE WHAT SHE FELT ON THE SUBJECT
322-124147-0039 AND ANSWER EVERY WISH OF HER HEART THEY AGREED THAT MISSUS BENNET SHOULD ONLY HEAR OF THE DEPARTURE OF THE FAMILY WITHOUT BEING ALARMED ON THE SCORE OF THE GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT BUT EVEN THIS PARTIAL COMMUNICATION GAVE HER A GREAT DEAL OF CONCERN
322-124147-0040 AND SHE BEWAILED IT AS EXCEEDINGLY UNLUCKY THAT THE LADIES SHOULD HAPPEN TO GO AWAY JUST AS THEY WERE ALL GETTING SO INTIMATE TOGETHER AFTER LAMENTING IT HOWEVER AT SOME LENGTH
322-124147-0042 THE BENNETS WERE ENGAGED TO DINE WITH THE LUCASES AND AGAIN DURING THE CHIEF OF THE DAY WAS MISS LUCAS SO KIND AS TO LISTEN TO MISTER COLLINS ELIZABETH TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING HER
322-124147-0043 IT KEEPS HIM IN GOOD HUMOUR SAID SHE AND I AM MORE OBLIGED TO YOU THAN I CAN EXPRESS CHARLOTTE ASSURED HER FRIEND OF HER SATISFACTION IN BEING USEFUL
322-124147-0045 BY ENGAGING THEM TOWARDS HERSELF SUCH WAS MISS LUCAS'S SCHEME AND APPEARANCES WERE SO FAVOURABLE THAT WHEN THEY PARTED AT NIGHT
322-124147-0046 BUT HERE SHE DID INJUSTICE TO THE FIRE AND INDEPENDENCE OF HIS CHARACTER FOR IT LED HIM TO ESCAPE OUT OF LONGBOURN HOUSE THE NEXT MORNING WITH ADMIRABLE SLYNESS AND HASTEN TO LUCAS LODGE TO THROW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
322-124147-0048 FOR THOUGH FEELING ALMOST SECURE AND WITH REASON FOR CHARLOTTE HAD BEEN TOLERABLY ENCOURAGING HE WAS COMPARATIVELY DIFFIDENT SINCE THE ADVENTURE OF WEDNESDAY HIS RECEPTION HOWEVER WAS OF THE MOST FLATTERING KIND
322-124147-0049 MISS LUCAS PERCEIVED HIM FROM AN UPPER WINDOW AS HE WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AND INSTANTLY SET OUT TO MEET HIM ACCIDENTALLY IN THE LANE BUT LITTLE HAD SHE DARED TO HOPE THAT SO MUCH LOVE AND ELOQUENCE AWAITED HER THERE
322-124147-0051 THE STUPIDITY WITH WHICH HE WAS FAVOURED BY NATURE MUST GUARD HIS COURTSHIP FROM ANY CHARM THAT COULD MAKE A WOMAN WISH FOR ITS CONTINUANCE AND MISS LUCAS
322-124147-0052 WHO ACCEPTED HIM SOLELY FROM THE PURE AND DISINTERESTED DESIRE OF AN ESTABLISHMENT CARED NOT HOW SOON THAT ESTABLISHMENT WERE GAINED SIR WILLIAM AND LADY LUCAS WERE SPEEDILY APPLIED TO FOR THEIR CONSENT
322-124147-0054 AND SIR WILLIAM GAVE IT AS HIS DECIDED OPINION THAT WHENEVER MISTER COLLINS SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF THE LONGBOURN ESTATE IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EXPEDIENT THAT BOTH HE AND HIS WIFE SHOULD MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE AT SAINT JAMES'S
322-124147-0055 THE WHOLE FAMILY IN SHORT WERE PROPERLY OVERJOYED ON THE OCCASION THE YOUNGER GIRLS FORMED HOPES OF COMING OUT A YEAR OR TWO SOONER THAN THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE DONE
322-124147-0057 HER REFLECTIONS WERE IN GENERAL SATISFACTORY MISTER COLLINS TO BE SURE WAS NEITHER SENSIBLE NOR AGREEABLE HIS SOCIETY WAS IRKSOME AND HIS ATTACHMENT TO HER MUST BE IMAGINARY
322-124147-0058 BUT STILL HE WOULD BE HER HUSBAND WITHOUT THINKING HIGHLY EITHER OF MEN OR MATRIMONY MARRIAGE HAD ALWAYS BEEN HER OBJECT
322-124147-0060 WITHOUT HAVING EVER BEEN HANDSOME SHE FELT ALL THE GOOD LUCK OF IT THE LEAST AGREEABLE CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE BUSINESS WAS THE SURPRISE IT MUST OCCASION TO ELIZABETH BENNET
322-124147-0061 WHOSE FRIENDSHIP SHE VALUED BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER PERSON ELIZABETH WOULD WONDER AND PROBABLY WOULD BLAME HER AND THOUGH HER RESOLUTION WAS NOT TO BE SHAKEN HER FEELINGS MUST BE HURT
322-124147-0063 FOR THE CURIOSITY EXCITED BY HIS LONG ABSENCE BURST FORTH IN SUCH VERY DIRECT QUESTIONS ON HIS RETURN AS REQUIRED SOME INGENUITY TO EVADE AND HE WAS AT THE SAME TIME EXERCISING GREAT SELF DENIAL
322-124147-0064 FOR HE WAS LONGING TO PUBLISH HIS PROSPEROUS LOVE AS HE WAS TO BEGIN HIS JOURNEY TOO EARLY ON THE MORROW TO SEE ANY OF THE FAMILY THE CEREMONY OF LEAVE TAKING WAS PERFORMED WHEN THE LADIES MOVED FOR THE NIGHT
322-124147-0066 MY DEAR MADAM HE REPLIED THIS INVITATION IS PARTICULARLY GRATIFYING BECAUSE IT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN HOPING TO RECEIVE
322-124147-0067 AND YOU MAY BE VERY CERTAIN THAT I SHALL AVAIL MYSELF OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALL ASTONISHED AND MISTER BENNET WHO COULD BY NO MEANS WISH FOR SO SPEEDY A RETURN
322-124147-0069 YOU CANNOT BE TOO MUCH UPON YOUR GUARD RISK ANYTHING RATHER THAN HER DISPLEASURE AND IF YOU FIND IT LIKELY TO BE RAISED BY YOUR COMING TO US AGAIN WHICH I SHOULD THINK EXCEEDINGLY PROBABLE
322-124147-0070 STAY QUIETLY AT HOME AND BE SATISFIED THAT WE SHALL TAKE NO OFFENCE BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MY GRATITUDE IS WARMLY EXCITED BY SUCH AFFECTIONATE ATTENTION
322-124147-0072 NOT EXCEPTING MY COUSIN ELIZABETH WITH PROPER CIVILITIES THE LADIES THEN WITHDREW
322-124147-0073 THERE WAS A SOLIDITY IN HIS REFLECTIONS WHICH OFTEN STRUCK HER AND THOUGH BY NO MEANS SO CLEVER AS HERSELF SHE THOUGHT THAT IF ENCOURAGED TO READ AND IMPROVE HIMSELF BY SUCH AN EXAMPLE AS HERS
322-124147-0075 SEEMED ALMOST AS FAR FROM POSSIBILITY
322-124147-0076 AND HER ASTONISHMENT WAS CONSEQUENTLY SO GREAT AS TO OVERCOME AT FIRST THE BOUNDS OF DECORUM AND SHE COULD NOT HELP CRYING OUT ENGAGED TO MISTER COLLINS
322-124147-0078 SHE SOON REGAINED HER COMPOSURE AND CALMLY REPLIED WHY SHOULD YOU BE SURPRISED MY DEAR ELIZA
322-124147-0079 AND THAT SHE WISHED HER ALL IMAGINABLE HAPPINESS I SEE WHAT YOU ARE FEELING REPLIED CHARLOTTE YOU MUST BE SURPRISED VERY MUCH SURPRISED SO LATELY AS MISTER COLLINS WAS WISHING TO MARRY YOU
322-124147-0081 I AM CONVINCED THAT MY CHANCE OF HAPPINESS WITH HIM IS AS FAIR AS MOST PEOPLE CAN BOAST ON ENTERING THE MARRIAGE STATE ELIZABETH QUIETLY ANSWERED UNDOUBTEDLY AND AFTER AN AWKWARD PAUSE
322-124147-0082 THE STRANGENESS OF MISTER COLLINS'S MAKING TWO OFFERS OF MARRIAGE WITHIN THREE DAYS WAS NOTHING IN COMPARISON OF HIS BEING NOW ACCEPTED SHE HAD ALWAYS FELT THAT CHARLOTTE'S OPINION OF MATRIMONY WAS NOT EXACTLY LIKE HER OWN
328-129766-0000 AND SO MIGHT MARRY AGAIN WHEN HE WOULD
328-129766-0001 AND TO ASSIST AND SUPPORT ME AS LONG AS I LIVED AND THAT IF HE DIED BEFORE ME HE WOULD LEAVE SUFFICIENT TO HIS MOTHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME STILL IN THE NAME OF A SISTER AND HE WAS IN SOME RESPECTS CAREFUL OF ME WHEN HE HEARD OF ME
328-129766-0003 WE HAD AN INDIFFERENT GOOD VOYAGE TILL WE CAME JUST UPON THE COAST OF ENGLAND AND WHERE WE ARRIVED IN TWO AND THIRTY DAYS BUT WERE THEN RUFFLED WITH TWO OR THREE STORMS
328-129766-0004 GOT SOME REFRESHMENT ON SHORE AND PUT TO SEA AGAIN THOUGH WE MET WITH VERY BAD WEATHER AGAIN IN WHICH THE SHIP SPRUNG HER MAINMAST AS THEY CALLED IT FOR I KNEW NOT WHAT THEY MEANT BUT WE GOT AT LAST INTO MILFORD HAVEN IN WALES
328-129766-0006 THE ISLE OF BRITAIN I RESOLVED TO VENTURE IT NO MORE UPON THE WATERS WHICH HAD BEEN SO TERRIBLE TO ME SO GETTING MY CLOTHES AND MONEY ON SHORE WITH MY BILLS OF LOADING AND OTHER PAPERS I RESOLVED TO COME FOR LONDON
328-129766-0007 THE PORT WHITHER SHE WAS BOUND WAS TO BRISTOL WHERE MY BROTHER'S CHIEF CORRESPONDENT LIVED I GOT TO LONDON IN ABOUT THREE WEEKS WHERE I HEARD A LITTLE WHILE AFTER THAT THE SHIP WAS ARRIVED IN BRISTOL
328-129766-0009 WHAT I BROUGHT WITH ME WAS INDEED CONSIDERABLE HAD IT COME SAFE AND BY THE HELP OF IT I MIGHT HAVE MARRIED AGAIN TOLERABLY WELL BUT AS IT WAS I WAS REDUCED TO BETWEEN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN THE WHOLE AND THIS WITHOUT ANY HOPE OF RECRUIT
328-129766-0010 I WAS ENTIRELY WITHOUT FRIENDS NAY EVEN SO MUCH AS WITHOUT ACQUAINTANCE
328-129766-0012 I TOOK THE DIVERSION OF GOING TO THE BATH FOR AS I WAS STILL FAR FROM BEING OLD SO MY HUMOUR WHICH WAS ALWAYS GAY CONTINUED SO TO AN EXTREME AND BEING NOW AS IT WERE A WOMAN OF FORTUNE THOUGH I WAS A WOMAN WITHOUT A FORTUNE
328-129766-0013 AS HAD BEEN MY CASE BEFORE THE BATH IS A PLACE OF GALLANTRY ENOUGH EXPENSIVE AND FULL OF SNARES I WENT THITHER INDEED
328-129766-0015 AS IT IS CALLED THERE AND CONTRACTED SOME UNHAPPY ACQUAINTANCES WHICH RATHER PROMPTED THE FOLLIES I FELL AFTERWARDS INTO THAN FORTIFIED ME AGAINST THEM I LIVED PLEASANTLY ENOUGH KEPT GOOD COMPANY THAT IS TO SAY GAY FINE COMPANY
328-129766-0016 BUT HAD THE DISCOURAGEMENT TO FIND THIS WAY OF LIVING SUNK ME EXCEEDINGLY AND THAT AS I HAD NO SETTLED INCOME SO SPENDING UPON THE MAIN STOCK WAS BUT A CERTAIN KIND OF BLEEDING TO DEATH AND THIS GAVE ME MANY SAD REFLECTIONS IN THE INTERVAL OF MY OTHER THOUGHTS
328-129766-0018 BUT I WAS IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR IT I WAS NOT NOW AT REDRIFF WHERE IF I HAD SET MYSELF TOLERABLY UP SOME HONEST SEA CAPTAIN OR OTHER MIGHT HAVE TALKED WITH ME UPON THE HONOURABLE TERMS OF MATRIMONY BUT I WAS AT THE BATH
328-129766-0019 WHERE MEN FIND A MISTRESS SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY LOOK FOR A WIFE AND CONSEQUENTLY ALL THE PARTICULAR ACQUAINTANCES A WOMAN CAN EXPECT TO MAKE THERE MUST HAVE SOME TENDENCY THAT WAY I HAD SPENT THE FIRST SEASON WELL ENOUGH
328-129766-0021 AS IT MIGHT BE CALLED I HAD RESISTED SOME CASUAL OFFERS OF GALLANTRY AND HAD MANAGED THAT WAY WELL ENOUGH I WAS NOT WICKED ENOUGH TO COME INTO THE CRIME FOR THE MERE VICE OF IT AND I HAD NO EXTRAORDINARY OFFERS MADE ME THAT TEMPTED ME WITH THE MAIN THING WHICH I WANTED
328-129766-0022 I CONTRACTED AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH A WOMAN IN WHOSE HOUSE I LODGED WHO THOUGH SHE DID NOT KEEP AN ILL HOUSE AS WE CALL IT YET HAD NONE OF THE BEST PRINCIPLES IN HERSELF I HAD ON ALL OCCASIONS BEHAVED MYSELF SO WELL
328-129766-0024 FOR A WICKED CORRESPONDENCE IF THEY HAD ANY OF THEM OFFERED IT YET THERE WAS ONE GENTLEMAN AS ABOVE WHO ALWAYS SINGLED ME OUT FOR THE DIVERSION OF MY COMPANY AS HE CALLED IT WHICH AS HE WAS PLEASED TO SAY WAS VERY AGREEABLE TO HIM BUT AT THAT TIME
328-129766-0025 THERE WAS NO MORE IN IT I HAD MANY MELANCHOLY HOURS AT THE BATH AFTER THE COMPANY WAS GONE
328-129766-0027 HERE I SAY I PASSED THE WINTER AS HEAVILY AS I HAD PASSED THE AUTUMN CHEERFULLY
328-129766-0028 OF WHAT LAY HARDEST UPON MY MIND AND PARTICULARLY THE NARROWNESS OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE LOSS OF MY FORTUNE BY THE DAMAGE OF MY GOODS AT SEA I TOLD HER ALSO THAT I HAD A MOTHER AND A BROTHER IN VIRGINIA IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES
328-129766-0030 SO I DID NOT FAIL TO LET MY NEW FRIEND KNOW THAT I EXPECTED A SUPPLY FROM THENCE AND SO INDEED I DID AND AS THE SHIPS WENT FROM BRISTOL TO YORK RIVER IN VIRGINIA AND BACK AGAIN GENERALLY IN LESS TIME FROM LONDON
328-129766-0031 AND THAT MY BROTHER CORRESPONDED CHIEFLY AT BRISTOL I THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH BETTER FOR ME TO WAIT HERE FOR MY RETURNS THAN TO GO TO LONDON WHERE ALSO I HAD NOT THE LEAST ACQUAINTANCE MY NEW FRIEND APPEARED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH MY CONDITION
328-129766-0033 TILL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY TO DO OTHERWISE SHE HAD SOME PERSONS OF CHARACTER THAT FREQUENTLY LODGED IN HER HOUSE AND IN PARTICULAR THE GENTLEMAN WHO AS I SAID SINGLED ME OUT FOR HIS COMPANION
328-129766-0034 THE WINTER BEFORE AND HE CAME DOWN AGAIN WITH ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN HIS COMPANY AND TWO SERVANTS AND LODGED IN THE SAME HOUSE
328-129766-0036 IF I MIGHT BELIEVE HIM WAS TO HIM
328-129766-0037 AND HE HAD SUCH AN OPINION OF MY VIRTUE THAT AS HE OFTEN PROFESSED HE BELIEVED IF HE SHOULD OFFER ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD REJECT HIM WITH CONTEMPT HE SOON UNDERSTOOD FROM ME THAT I WAS A WIDOW THAT I HAD ARRIVED AT BRISTOL FROM VIRGINIA BY THE LAST SHIPS
328-129766-0039 OF HER OWN RELATIONS WHICH HE CONSENTED TO TO AVOID ANY REFLECTIONS THAT MIGHT AS WAS NOT UNUSUAL IN SUCH CASES BE CAST ON HIM FOR MISMANAGING HER CURE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE CAME TO THE BATH TO DIVERT HIS THOUGHTS
328-129766-0040 FROM THE DISTURBANCE OF SUCH A MELANCHOLY CIRCUMSTANCE AS THAT WAS MY LANDLADY WHO OF HER OWN ACCORD ENCOURAGED THE CORRESPONDENCE ON ALL OCCASIONS GAVE ME AN ADVANTAGEOUS CHARACTER OF HIM
328-129766-0042 AND I ALSO INTO HIS WHEN HE WAS IN BED YET HE NEVER OFFERED ANYTHING TO ME FURTHER THAN A KISS OR SO MUCH AS SOLICITED ME TO ANYTHING TILL LONG AFTER AS YOU SHALL HEAR
328-129766-0043 AND SHE AGAIN USED TO TELL ME SHE BELIEVED IT WAS SO FROM THE BEGINNING HOWEVER SHE USED TO TELL ME THAT SHE THOUGHT I OUGHT TO EXPECT SOME GRATIFICATION FROM HIM FOR MY COMPANY FOR INDEED HE DID AS IT WERE ENGROSS ME AND I WAS SELDOM FROM HIM
328-129766-0045 AND SHE DID SO AND MANAGED IT SO DEXTEROUSLY
328-129766-0046 AND SO I PUT OFF ALL ROOM FOR ANY OFFER FOR THE PRESENT HOWEVER IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE ATTACKED ME AGAIN
328-129766-0048 IN NEED OF ANY ASSISTANCE HE HAD BUT ONE THING MORE TO DESIRE OF ME AND THAT WAS THAT I WOULD PROMISE HIM THAT WHEN I WAS ANY WAY STRAITENED OR LIKE TO BE SO I WOULD FRANKLY TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I WOULD MAKE USE OF HIM WITH THE SAME FREEDOM THAT HE MADE THE OFFER
328-129766-0049 ADDING THAT I SHOULD ALWAYS FIND I HAD A TRUE FRIEND THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS AFRAID TO TRUST HIM I OMITTED NOTHING THAT WAS FIT TO BE SAID BY ONE INFINITELY OBLIGED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT I HAD A DUE SENSE OF HIS KINDNESS
328-129766-0051 THOUGH I WAS SECRETLY VERY GLAD OF HIS OFFER SOME WEEKS PASSED AFTER THIS AND STILL I NEVER ASKED HIM FOR MONEY WHEN MY LANDLADY A CUNNING CREATURE WHO HAD OFTEN PRESSED ME TO IT BUT FOUND THAT I COULD NOT DO IT
328-129766-0052 MAKES A STORY OF HER OWN INVENTING AND COMES IN
328-129766-0054 BUT THE MAN YOU SENT TO BRISTOL YESTERDAY FOR MONEY IS COME BACK AND SAYS HE HAS BROUGHT NONE NOW I COULD BY NO MEANS LIKE HER PROJECT
328-129766-0055 WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT WANT AND I CLEARLY SAW THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY BEING BACKWARD TO ASK SO I TOOK HER UP SHORT
328-129766-0057 AS SHE DID AT FIRST AS WELL AS I TAKING IT AS I FANCIED HE WOULD AS SOMETHING FORWARD OF HER BUT WHEN HE SAW ME GIVE SUCH AN ANSWER HE CAME IMMEDIATELY TO HIMSELF AGAIN THE NEXT MORNING WE TALKED OF IT AGAIN WHEN I FOUND HE WAS FULLY SATISFIED
328-129766-0058 AND SMILING SAID HE HOPED I WOULD NOT WANT MONEY AND NOT TELL HIM OF IT AND THAT I HAD PROMISED HIM OTHERWISE I TOLD HIM I HAD BEEN VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED AT MY LANDLADY'S TALKING SO PUBLICLY THE DAY BEFORE OF WHAT SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH
328-129766-0060 HE WAS IN A MIGHT GOOD HUMOUR WHEN HE HEARD ME SAY I HAD PAID HER AND IT WENT OFF INTO SOME OTHER DISCOURSE AT THAT TIME BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE HAVING HEARD ME UP ABOUT MY ROOM BEFORE HIM HE CALLED TO ME AND I ANSWERING HE ASKED ME TO COME INTO HIS CHAMBER
328-129766-0061 FOR HE SAID HE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TO ME WHICH WAS OF SOME MOMENT AFTER SOME VERY KIND EXPRESSIONS HE ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE VERY HONEST TO HIM AND GIVE A SINCERE ANSWER TO ONE THING HE WOULD DESIRE OF ME
328-129766-0063 I IMMEDIATELY PUT MY HAND INTO MY POCKET AND LAUGHING TO HIM PULLED IT OUT AND THERE WAS IN IT THREE GUINEAS AND A HALF
328-129766-0064 NOT BY A GREAT DEAL WELL THEN HE SAID HE WOULD HAVE ME PROMISE TO GO AND FETCH HIM ALL THE MONEY I HAD EVERY FARTHING I TOLD HIM I WOULD AND I WENT INTO MY CHAMBER AND FETCHED HIM A LITTLE PRIVATE DRAWER
328-129766-0066 AND THEN REACHING HIS POCKET PULLED OUT A KEY AND BADE ME OPEN A LITTLE WALNUT TREE BOX HE HAD UPON THE TABLE AND BRING HIM SUCH A DRAWER WHICH I DID IN WHICH DRAWER THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY IN GOLD I BELIEVE NEAR TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS
328-129766-0067 BUT I KNEW NOT HOW MUCH HE TOOK THE DRAWER AND TAKING MY HAND MADE ME PUT IT IN AND TAKE A WHOLE HANDFUL I WAS BACKWARD AT THAT BUT HE HELD MY HAND HARD IN HIS HAND
328-129766-0069 AND CARRY IT ALL HOME INTO MY OWN CHAMBER I RELATE THIS STORY THE MORE PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE GOOD HUMOUR THERE WAS IN IT AND TO SHOW THE TEMPER WITH WHICH WE CONVERSED
328-129766-0070 AND IN A WORD PRESSED ME TO BUY BETTER
328-129766-0072 AND THAT HE THOUGHT I HAD MERITED IT FROM HIM BY GIVING HIM MY COMPANY SO ENTIRELY AS I HAD DONE AFTER THIS HE MADE ME TAKE A MAID AND KEEP HOUSE
328-129766-0073 WHICH I DID VERY WILLINGLY BELIEVING AS IT APPEARED THAT I SHOULD LOSE NOTHING BY IT NOR DID THE WOMAN OF THE HOUSE FAIL TO FIND HER ACCOUNT IN IT TOO WE HAD LIVED THUS NEAR THREE MONTHS WHEN
328-129766-0075 I WAS NOT VERY EASY IN THAT PROPOSAL NOT KNOWING WHAT POSTURE I WAS TO LIVE IN THERE OR HOW HE MIGHT USE ME BUT WHILE THIS WAS IN DEBATE
328-129766-0076 CALLED SHEPTON WHERE HE HAD SOME BUSINESS AND WAS THERE TAKEN VERY ILL AND SO ILL THAT HE COULD NOT TRAVEL SO HE SENT HIS MAN BACK TO BATH TO BEG ME THAT I WOULD HIRE A COACH AND COME OVER TO HIM BEFORE HE WENT
328-129766-0078 IN A LITTER TO THE BATH WHERE THERE WAS MORE HELP AND BETTER ADVICE TO BE HAD HE CONSENTED AND I BROUGHT HIM TO THE BATH WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES AS I REMEMBER HERE HE CONTINUED VERY ILL OF A FEVER
328-129766-0079 AND KEPT HIS BED FIVE WEEKS ALL WHICH TIME I NURSED HIM AND TENDED HIM MYSELF
328-129766-0081 I WAS INDEED SENSIBLY AFFECTED WITH HIS CONDITION AND WITH THE APPREHENSION OF LOSING SUCH A FRIEND AS HE WAS AND WAS LIKE TO BE TO ME AND I USED TO SIT AND CRY BY HIM MANY HOURS TOGETHER
328-129766-0082 HOWEVER AT LAST HE GREW BETTER AND GAVE HOPES THAT HE WOULD RECOVER AS INDEED HE DID THOUGH VERY SLOWLY WERE IT OTHERWISE THAN WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY I SHOULD NOT BE BACKWARD TO DISCLOSE IT
328-129766-0084 OF ATTENDING HIM NIGHT AND DAY WHEN HE WAS SICK THERE HAD NOT PASSED THE LEAST IMMODEST WORD OR ACTION BETWEEN US OH THAT IT HAD BEEN SO TO THE LAST AFTER SOME TIME HE GATHERED STRENGTH AND GREW WELL APACE
328-129766-0085 AND I WOULD HAVE REMOVED MY PALLET BED BUT HE WOULD NOT LET ME TILL HE WAS ABLE TO VENTURE HIMSELF WITHOUT ANYBODY TO SIT UP WITH HIM AND THEN I REMOVED TO MY OWN CHAMBER
328-129766-0087 BUT ALL ALONG ATTESTED IT TO BE WITH THE UTMOST RESERVE FOR MY VIRTUE AND HIS OWN I TOLD HIM I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF IT HE CARRIED IT THAT LENGTH THAT HE PROTESTED TO ME THAT IF HE WAS NAKED IN BED WITH ME
328-129766-0088 AS HE WOULD DEFEND IT IF I WAS ASSAULTED BY A RAVISHER I BELIEVED HIM AND TOLD HIM I DID SO BUT THIS DID NOT SATISFY HIM HE WOULD HE SAID
328-129766-0090 TO HAVE NO LODGING IN THE INN BUT IN ONE LARGE CHAMBER WITH TWO BEDS IN IT
328-129766-0091 AND COMING INTO THAT ROOM SAID VERY FRANKLY TO HIM SIR IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS TO INQUIRE WHETHER THE LADY BE YOUR SPOUSE OR NO
328-129766-0093 HE DECENTLY WENT OUT OF THE ROOM TILL I WAS IN BED AND THEN WENT TO BED IN THE BED ON HIS OWN SIDE OF THE ROOM BUT LAY THERE TALKING TO ME A GREAT WHILE AT LAST REPEATING HIS USUAL SAYING THAT HE COULD LIE NAKED IN THE BED WITH ME AND NOT OFFER ME THE LEAST INJURY
328-129766-0094 HE STARTS OUT OF HIS BED AND NOW MY DEAR SAYS HE YOU SHALL SEE HOW JUST I WILL BE TO YOU AND THAT I CAN KEEP MY WORD AND AWAY HE COMES TO MY BED I RESISTED A LITTLE BUT I MUST CONFESS I SHOULD NOT HAVE RESISTED HIM MUCH
328-129766-0096 OTHER THAN EMBRACING ME AS I SAY IN HIS ARMS NO NOT THE WHOLE NIGHT BUT ROSE UP AND DRESSED HIM IN THE MORNING AND LEFT ME AS INNOCENT FOR HIM AS I WAS THE DAY I WAS BORN THIS WAS A SURPRISING THING TO ME
328-129766-0097 AND PERHAPS MAY BE SO TO OTHERS WHO KNOW HOW THE LAWS OF NATURE WORK FOR HE WAS A STRONG VIGOROUS BRISK PERSON NOR DID HE ACT THUS ON A PRINCIPLE OF RELIGION AT ALL BUT OF MERE AFFECTION INSISTING ON IT
332-128985-0000 WE WILL PASS TO THE CONSIDERATION OF A REGULAR OUT AND OUT PIRATE ONE FROM WHOSE MAST HEAD WOULD HAVE FLOATED THE BLACK FLAG WITH ITS SKULL AND CROSS BONES IF THAT EMBLEMATIC PIECE OF BUNTING HAD BEEN IN USE BY THE PIRATES OF THE PERIOD
332-128985-0001 AND HIS OWN WAS UNKNOWN AND THE BRAZILIAN BECAUSE HE WAS BORN IN BRAZIL THOUGH OF DUTCH PARENTS UNLIKE MOST OF HIS FELLOW PRACTITIONERS HE DID NOT GRADUALLY BECOME A PIRATE FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH
332-128985-0003 THAT HE WAS DESTINED TO BECOME A MOST REMARKABLE SEA ROBBER HE WAS OFFERED THE COMMAND OF A SHIP WITH A WELL ARMED CREW OF MARINE SAVAGES
332-128985-0004 HE FELL IN WITH A SPANISH SHIP LOADED WITH SILVER BULLION HAVING CAPTURED THIS HE SAILED WITH HIS PRIZE TO JAMAICA WHICH WAS ONE OF THE GREAT RESORTS OF THE ENGLISH BUCCANEERS THERE HIS SUCCESS DELIGHTED THE COMMUNITY
332-128985-0006 WHO HAD NO SYMPATHY WITH PIRATES AND AS FOR ESQUEMELING HE SIMPLY WORSHIPPED THE GREAT BRAZILIAN DESPERADO IF HE HAD BEEN WRITING THE LIFE AND TIMES OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT JULIUS CAESAR OR MISTER GLADSTONE
332-128985-0007 HE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ENTHUSIASTIC IN HIS PRAISES AND AS IN THE ARABIAN NIGHTS THE ROC IS DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST OF BIRDS SO IN THE EYES OF THE BUCCANEER BIOGRAPHER THIS ROC WAS THE GREATEST OF PIRATES
332-128985-0009 THIS STORY HOWEVER I REGARD WITH A GREAT DEAL OF DOUBT
332-128985-0010 BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS AN EASY THING TO FRIGHTEN A CHILD INTO GOING TO SLEEP IF I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO MAKE A YOUNGSTER TAKE A NAP I SHOULD SAY NOTHING OF THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS IN CUBA OR OF THE PERSECUTIONS OF THE ARMENIANS
332-128985-0012 HIS EYEBROWS WERE ENORMOUSLY LARGE AND BUSHY AND FROM UNDER THEM HE GLARED AT HIS MUNDANE SURROUNDINGS HE WAS NOT A MAN WHOSE SPIRIT COULD BE QUELLED BY LOOKING HIM STEADFASTLY IN THE EYE IT WAS HIS CUSTOM IN THE DAYTIME TO WALK ABOUT
332-128985-0013 CARRYING A DRAWN CUTLASS RESTING EASILY UPON HIS ARM EDGE UP VERY MUCH AS A FINE GENTLEMAN CARRIES HIS HIGH SILK HAT AND ANY ONE WHO SHOULD IMPERTINENTLY STARE OR ENDEAVOR TO QUELL HIS HIGH SPIRITS IN ANY OTHER WAY
332-128985-0015 BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS SO STRICT AND EXACTING DURING THE BUSINESS SESSIONS OF HIS PIRATICAL YEAR BY WHICH I MEAN WHEN HE WAS CRUISING AROUND AFTER PRIZES HE WAS VERY MUCH MORE DISAGREEABLE WHEN HE WAS TAKING A VACATION
332-128985-0016 ON HIS RETURN TO JAMAICA AFTER ONE OF HIS EXPEDITIONS IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GIVE HIMSELF SOME RELAXATION AFTER THE HARDSHIPS AND DANGERS THROUGH WHICH HE HAD PASSED AND ON SUCH OCCASIONS IT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO ROC TO GET HIMSELF THOROUGHLY DRUNK
332-128985-0018 THAT HIS VISITS TO JAMAICA WERE LOOKED FORWARD TO WITH ANY EAGER ANTICIPATIONS ROC IT MAY BE SAID WAS NOT ONLY A BLOODY PIRATE BUT A BLOODED ONE HE WAS THOROUGHBRED
332-128985-0019 FROM THE TIME HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO ASSERT HIS INDIVIDUALITY HE HAD BEEN A PIRATE AND THERE WAS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT HE WOULD EVER REFORM HIMSELF INTO ANYTHING ELSE THERE WERE NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES IN HIS CASE
332-128985-0021 WHEN THAT BUSHY BEARDED PIRATE WAS RUNNING AMUCK IN THE STREETS BUT IF HE HAD IT IS NOT PROBABLE THAT HIS BOOK WOULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN HE ASSURES US THAT WHEN ROC WAS NOT DRUNK HE WAS ESTEEMED BUT AT THE SAME TIME FEARED
332-128985-0022 BUT THERE ARE VARIOUS WAYS OF GAINING ESTEEM AND ROC'S METHOD CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL IN THE CASE OF HIS LITERARY ASSOCIATE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE HATRED OF THE SPANIARDS BY THE BUCCANEERS BEGAN VERY EARLY IN THE SETTLEMENT OF THE WEST INDIES
332-128985-0024 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TOO BAD FOR A SPANIARD THE OBJECT OF HIS LIFE WAS TO WAGE BITTER WAR AGAINST SPANISH SHIPS AND SPANISH SETTLEMENTS HE SELDOM GAVE ANY QUARTER TO HIS PRISONERS
332-128985-0025 THEN THERE WAS NOTHING FOR THEM TO DO BUT TO GO ON BOARD THEIR VESSELS AND PUT OUT TO SEA IN SEARCH OF SOME FRESH PRIZE SO FAR ROC'S CAREER HAD BEEN VERY MUCH LIKE THAT OF MANY OTHER COMPANIONS OF THE COAST
332-128985-0027 HE WAS CRUISING ABOUT CAMPEACHY WITHOUT SEEING ANY CRAFT THAT WAS WORTH CAPTURING
332-128985-0028 AND FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE ANY SPANISH VESSELS IN THE BAY WHICH WERE WELL LADEN AND WHICH WERE LIKELY SOON TO COME OUT SO WITH A SMALL BOAT FILLED WITH SOME OF HIS TRUSTY MEN HE ROWED QUIETLY INTO THE PORT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD DISCOVER
332-128985-0030 BUT HE CHOSE TO GO HIMSELF AND HE CAME TO GRIEF NO SOONER DID THE PEOPLE ON THE SHIPS LYING IN THE HARBOR BEHOLD A BOAT APPROACHING WITH A BIG BROWED BROAD JAWED MARINER SITTING IN THE STERN
332-128985-0031 AND WITH A GOOD MANY MORE BROAD BACKED HAIRY MARINERS THAN WERE NECESSARY PULLING AT THE OARS THAN THEY GAVE THE ALARM
332-128985-0033 WHEN THE PIRATE CAPTAIN AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE BROUGHT BEFORE THE GOVERNOR HE MADE NO PRETENCE OF PUTTING THEM TO TRIAL BUCCANEERS WERE OUTLAWED BY THE SPANISH
332-128985-0034 AND WERE CONSIDERED AS WILD BEASTS TO BE KILLED WITHOUT MERCY WHEREVER CAUGHT CONSEQUENTLY ROC AND HIS MEN WERE THROWN INTO A DUNGEON AND CONDEMNED TO BE EXECUTED IF HOWEVER THE SPANISH GOVERNOR HAD KNOWN WHAT WAS GOOD FOR HIMSELF
332-128985-0036 THIS WAS A BRANCH OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH A CAPABLE PIRATE WAS OBLIGED TO BE PROFICIENT IF HE COULD NOT GET HIMSELF OUT OF SCRAPES HE COULD NOT EXPECT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS CASE THERE WAS NO CHANCE OF CUTTING DOWN SENTINELS
332-128985-0037 OR JUMPING OVERBOARD WITH A COUPLE OF WINE JARS FOR A LIFE PRESERVER OR OF DOING ANY OF THOSE ORDINARY THINGS WHICH PIRATES WERE IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHEN ESCAPING FROM THEIR CAPTORS
332-128985-0039 AND THEY WERE OBLIGED TO DEPEND UPON THEIR WITS IF THEY HAD ANY ROC HAD PLENTY OF WIT AND HE USED IT WELL THERE WAS A SLAVE PROBABLY NOT A NEGRO NOR A NATIVE
332-128985-0040 WHO CAME IN TO BRING HIM FOOD AND DRINK AND BY THE MEANS OF THIS MAN THE PIRATE HOPED TO PLAY A TRICK UPON THE GOVERNOR HE PROMISED THE SLAVE THAT IF HE WOULD HELP HIM AND HE TOLD HIM IT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO DO SO
332-128985-0042 AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO BRING SOME WRITING MATERIALS TO ROC WHO THEREUPON BEGAN THE COMPOSITION OF A LETTER
332-128985-0043 WHEN HE WAS COMING INTO THE BAY ROC HAD NOTICED A LARGE FRENCH VESSEL THAT WAS LYING AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE TOWN
332-128985-0045 FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE WOULD HE GIVE QUARTER TO ANY SPANIARD WHO MIGHT FALL INTO HIS HANDS AND HE MOREOVER THREATENED THAT ANY KIND OF VENGEANCE WHICH SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE FOR THE BUCCANEERS AND FRENCH UNITED TO INFLICT UPON THE SPANISH SHIPS
332-128985-0046 OR UPON THE TOWN OF CAMPEACHY SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER HE SHOULD HEAR OF ANY INJURY THAT MIGHT BE INFLICTED UPON THE UNFORTUNATE MEN WHO WERE THEN LYING IMPRISONED IN THE FORTRESS WHEN THE SLAVE CAME BACK TO ROC
332-128985-0048 AND EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS TO RETURN AS IF HE HAD BEEN WALKING ALONG THE SHORE OF THE HARBOR WHEN HE WAS TO STATE THAT HE HAD BEEN PUT ON SHORE FROM THE FRENCH VESSEL IN THE OFFING WITH A LETTER WHICH HE WAS TO PRESENT TO THE GOVERNOR THE SLAVE PERFORMED HIS PART OF THE BUSINESS VERY WELL
332-128985-0049 THE NEXT DAY WET AND BEDRAGGLED FROM MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE WEEDS AND MUD OF THE COAST HE PRESENTED HIMSELF AT THE FORTRESS WITH HIS LETTER AND WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE IT TO THE GOVERNOR NO ONE SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS A PERSON EMPLOYED ABOUT THE PLACE
332-128985-0051 HE KNEW THAT THE FRENCH SHIP WHICH WAS LYING OUTSIDE THE HARBOR WAS A POWERFUL VESSEL AND HE DID NOT LIKE FRENCH SHIPS ANYWAY THE TOWN HAD ONCE BEEN TAKEN AND VERY BADLY TREATED BY A LITTLE FLEET OF FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUCCANEERS
332-128985-0052 AND HE WAS VERY ANXIOUS THAT NOTHING OF THE KIND SHOULD HAPPEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO GREAT SPANISH FORCE IN THE HARBOR AT THAT TIME AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW MANY BUCCANEERING VESSELS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GATHER TOGETHER IN THE BAY
332-128985-0054 AND HE DETERMINED TO GET RID OF HIM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HE FELT HIMSELF IN THE POSITION OF A MAN WHO HAS STOLEN A BABY BEAR AND WHO HEARS THE ROAR OF AN APPROACHING PARENT THROUGH THE WOODS
332-128985-0055 TO THROW AWAY THE CUB AND WALK OFF AS THOUGH HE HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ANY BEARS IN THAT FOREST WOULD BE THE INCLINATION OF A MAN SO SITUATED AND TO GET RID OF THE GREAT PIRATE WITHOUT PROVOKING THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FRIENDS
332-128985-0057 UPON THE SINGLE CONDITION THAT THEY WOULD ABANDON PIRACY AND AGREE TO BECOME QUIET CITIZENS IN WHATEVER RESPECTABLE VOCATION THEY MIGHT SELECT TO THESE TERMS ROC AND HIS MEN AGREED WITHOUT ARGUMENT
332-128985-0058 THEY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD RETIRE FROM THE BUCCANEERING BUSINESS AND THAT NOTHING WOULD SUIT THEM BETTER THAN TO RETURN TO THE WAYS OF CIVILIZATION AND VIRTUE THERE WAS A SHIP ABOUT TO DEPART FOR SPAIN AND ON THIS THE GOVERNOR GAVE ROC AND HIS MEN FREE PASSAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OCEAN
332-128985-0060 BY ALLOWING THEM TO ASSOCIATE WITH SUCH WICKED COMPANIONS AS FRENCHMEN AND ROC MADE NO SUGGESTION OF THE KIND KNOWING VERY WELL HOW GREATLY ASTONISHED THE FRENCH CAPTAIN WOULD BE IF THE GOVERNOR WERE TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM ON THE SUBJECT
332-128985-0061 ON THE VOYAGE TO SPAIN ROC WAS ON HIS GOOD BEHAVIOR AND HE WAS A MAN WHO KNEW HOW TO BEHAVE VERY WELL WHEN IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY NO DOUBT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MANY DULL DAYS ON BOARD SHIP
332-128985-0063 THAT THE CAPTAIN ALLOWED HIM TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE CREW ROC KNEW HOW TO DO A GREAT MANY THINGS NOT ONLY COULD HE MURDER AND ROB BUT HE KNEW HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY WHEN THERE WAS NO OTHER WAY OF FILLING HIS PURSE HE HAD LEARNED AMONG THE INDIANS
332-128985-0064 HOW TO SHOOT FISH WITH BOW AND ARROWS AND ON THIS VOYAGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC HE OCCUPIED ALL HIS SPARE TIME IN SITTING IN THE RIGGING AND SHOOTING THE FISH WHICH DISPORTED THEMSELVES ABOUT THE VESSEL
332-128985-0066 IN EVERY WAY ROC BEHAVED SO WELL THAT FOR HIS SAKE ALL HIS MEN WERE TREATED KINDLY AND ALLOWED MANY PRIVILEGES BUT WHEN THIS PARTY OF REFORMED PIRATES REACHED SPAIN AND WERE ALLOWED TO GO WHERE THEY PLEASED
332-128985-0067 THEY THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE OATHS THEY HAD TAKEN TO ABANDON PIRACY THAN THEY THOUGHT OF THE OATHS WHICH THEY HAD BEEN IN THE HABIT OF THROWING RIGHT AND LEFT
332-128985-0069 NOT ONLY DID ROC CAST FROM HIM EVERY THOUGHT OF REFORMATION AND A RESPECTABLE LIFE BUT HE DETERMINED TO BEGIN THE BUSINESS OF PIRACY ON A GRANDER SCALE THAN EVER BEFORE HE MADE A COMPACT WITH AN OLD FRENCH BUCCANEER
332-128985-0070 AND WITH A LARGE COMPANY OF BUCCANEERS HE ACTUALLY SET OUT TO TAKE A TOWN HAVING LOST EVERYTHING HE POSSESSED AND HAVING PASSED SUCH A LONG TIME WITHOUT ANY EMPLOYMENT MORE PROFITABLE THAN THAT OF SHOOTING FISH WITH A BOW AND ARROWS
332-128985-0072 FROM THE ACTIVE PRACTICE OF HIS PROFESSION
332-128985-0073 IN YUCATAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS A BOLD AND RASH UNDERTAKING THE TWO PIRATES WERE BOLD AND RASH ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ROC HAD BEEN A PRISONER IN MERIDA AND ON ACCOUNT OF HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOWN HE BELIEVED THAT HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS COULD LAND UPON THE COAST
332-128985-0075 AFTER THEY HAD LANDED WHO HURRIED TO MERIDA AND GAVE NOTICE OF THE APPROACH OF THE BUCCANEERS CONSEQUENTLY WHEN ROC AND HIS COMPANIONS REACHED THE TOWN THEY FOUND THE GARRISON PREPARED FOR THEM CANNONS LOADED AND ALL THE APPROACHES GUARDED
332-128985-0076 STILL THE PIRATES DID NOT HESITATE THEY ADVANCED FIERCELY TO THE ATTACK JUST AS THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHEN THEY WERE BOARDING A SPANISH VESSEL BUT THEY SOON FOUND THAT FIGHTING ON LAND WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM FIGHTING AT SEA
332-128985-0078 AND THEY WERE THEREFORE GREATLY DISMAYED WHEN A PARTY OF HORSEMEN FROM THE TOWN WHO HAD MADE A WIDE DETOUR THROUGH THE WOODS SUDDENLY CHARGED UPON THEIR REAR
332-128985-0079 TRIBUTOR AND A GREAT MANY OF THE PIRATES WERE KILLED OR TAKEN AND ROC THE BRAZILIAN HAD A TERRIBLE FALL THIS MOST MEMORABLE FALL OCCURRED IN THE ESTIMATION OF JOHN ESQUEMELING
332-128985-0081 BY IGNOMINIOUSLY RUNNING AWAY THE LOYAL CHRONICLER HAD AS FIRM A BELIEF IN THE ABSOLUTE INABILITY OF HIS HERO TO FLY FROM DANGER AS WAS SHOWN BY THE SCOTTISH DOUGLAS WHEN HE STOOD
332-128985-0082 COME ONE COME ALL THE BUSHY BROWED PIRATE OF THE DRAWN CUTLASS
332-128985-0084 BUT THIS DOWNFALL OF A HERO SIMPLY SHOWS THAT ESQUEMELING ALTHOUGH HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIRATICAL BODY AND WAS PROUD TO CONSIDER HIMSELF A BUCCANEER DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE TRUE NATURE OF A PIRATE UNDER THE BRUTALITY
332-128985-0085 THE CRUELTY THE DISHONESTY AND THE RECKLESSNESS OF THE SEA ROBBERS OF THOSE DAYS THERE WAS NEARLY ALWAYS MEANNESS AND COWARDICE ROC AS WE HAVE SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS SKETCH WAS A TYPICAL PIRATE
332-128985-0087 BUT WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAKE UP THE TRUE CHARACTER OF A PIRATE THE HISTORIAN JOHN SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VERY MUCH CUT UP BY THE MANNER IN WHICH HIS FAVORITE HERO HAD ROUNDED OFF HIS PIRATICAL CAREER
332-128985-0088 AND AFTER THAT HE ENTIRELY DROPPED ROC FROM HIS CHRONICLES
374-180298-0001 MARGUERITE TO BE UNABLE TO LIVE APART FROM ME IT WAS THE DAY AFTER THE EVENING WHEN SHE CAME TO SEE ME THAT I SENT HER MANON LESCAUT FROM THAT TIME SEEING THAT I COULD NOT CHANGE MY MISTRESS'S LIFE I CHANGED MY OWN
374-180298-0002 I WISHED ABOVE ALL NOT TO LEAVE MYSELF TIME TO THINK OVER THE POSITION I HAD ACCEPTED FOR IN SPITE OF MYSELF IT WAS A GREAT DISTRESS TO ME THUS MY LIFE GENERALLY SO CALM
374-180298-0004 NOTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE AS THEIR CAPRICES FLOWERS BOXES AT THE THEATRE SUPPERS DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WHICH ONE CAN NEVER REFUSE TO ONE'S MISTRESS AS I HAVE TOLD YOU I HAD LITTLE MONEY
374-180298-0005 MY FATHER WAS AND STILL IS RECEVEUR GENERAL AT C HE HAS A GREAT REPUTATION THERE FOR LOYALTY THANKS TO WHICH HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE SECURITY WHICH HE NEEDED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THIS POSITION
374-180298-0007 MY EXPENSES WERE VERY MODERATE ONLY I USED UP MY YEAR'S INCOME IN EIGHT MONTHS AND SPENT THE FOUR SUMMER MONTHS WITH MY FATHER WHICH PRACTICALLY GAVE ME TWELVE THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR AND IN ADDITION THE REPUTATION OF A GOOD SON
374-180298-0008 FOR THE REST NOT A PENNY OF DEBT THIS THEN WAS MY POSITION WHEN I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF MARGUERITE YOU CAN WELL UNDERSTAND THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF MY EXPENSES SOON INCREASED
374-180298-0010 SHE WOULD WRITE TO ME IN THE MORNING THAT SHE WOULD DINE WITH ME NOT AT HOME BUT AT SOME RESTAURANT IN PARIS OR IN THE COUNTRY I WOULD CALL FOR HER AND WE WOULD DINE AND GO ON TO THE THEATRE OFTEN HAVING SUPPER AS WELL
374-180298-0011 FORGIVE ME IF I GIVE YOU ALL THESE DETAILS BUT YOU WILL SEE THAT THEY WERE THE CAUSE OF WHAT WAS TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU IS A TRUE AND SIMPLE STORY AND I LEAVE TO IT ALL THE NAIVETE OF ITS DETAILS
374-180298-0013 MY LOVE FOR HER HAD SO DISTURBING AN INFLUENCE UPON ME THAT EVERY MOMENT I SPENT AWAY FROM MARGUERITE WAS LIKE A YEAR AND THAT I FELT THE NEED OF CONSUMING THESE MOMENTS IN THE FIRE OF SOME SORT OF PASSION
374-180298-0014 AS NOT TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING THEM I BEGAN BY BORROWING FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND FRANCS ON MY LITTLE CAPITAL AND WITH THIS I TOOK TO GAMBLING SINCE GAMBLING HOUSES WERE DESTROYED GAMBLING GOES ON EVERYWHERE
374-180298-0016 WHERE THERE IS STILL A CERTAIN RIGOUR IN REGARD TO PAYMENTS ONE IS ALMOST CERTAIN THE MOMENT ONE GAINS A CONSIDERABLE SUM NOT TO RECEIVE IT YOU WILL READILY UNDERSTAND WHY GAMBLING IS ONLY LIKELY TO BE CARRIED ON BY YOUNG PEOPLE
374-180298-0017 VERY MUCH IN NEED OF MONEY AND NOT POSSESSING THE FORTUNE NECESSARY FOR SUPPORTING THE LIFE THEY LEAD THEY GAMBLE THEN AND WITH THIS RESULT OR ELSE THEY GAIN AND THEN THOSE WHO LOSE SERVE TO PAY FOR THEIR HORSES AND MISTRESSES
374-180298-0019 WHOSE ONLY DEFECT IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS A YEAR I NEED NOT TELL YOU OF THOSE WHO CHEAT AT PLAY
374-180298-0020 I FLUNG MYSELF INTO THIS RAPID NOISY AND VOLCANIC LIFE WHICH HAD FORMERLY TERRIFIED ME WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AND WHICH HAD BECOME FOR ME THE NECESSARY COMPLEMENT OF MY LOVE FOR MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE COULD I HAVE DONE
374-180298-0022 WHILE GAMBLING GAVE A NEW TURN TO THE FEVER WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PREYED UPON MY HEART AND FIXED IT UPON A PASSION WHICH LAID HOLD ON ME IN SPITE OF MYSELF UNTIL THE HOUR STRUCK WHEN I MIGHT GO TO MY MISTRESS THEN
374-180298-0023 AND BY THIS I KNEW THE VIOLENCE OF MY LOVE I LEFT THE TABLE WITHOUT A MOMENT'S HESITATION WHETHER I WAS WINNING OR LOSING PITYING THOSE WHOM I LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT LIKE ME FIND THEIR REAL HAPPINESS IN LEAVING IT
374-180298-0025 I LOST ONLY WHAT I WAS ABLE TO PAY AND GAINED ONLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOSE FOR THE REST CHANCE WAS ON MY SIDE I MADE NO DEBTS AND I SPENT THREE TIMES AS MUCH MONEY AS WHEN I DID NOT GAMBLE
374-180298-0026 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO RESIST AN EXISTENCE
374-180298-0028 THEN SHE SOMETIMES CAME TO DINE WITH ME ONE MORNING I DID NOT GO TILL EIGHT AND THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I DID NOT GO TILL TWELVE BUT SOONER THAN THE MORAL METAMORPHOSIS A PHYSICAL METAMORPHOSIS CAME ABOUT IN MARGUERITE
374-180298-0029 I HAD TAKEN HER CURE IN HAND AND THE POOR GIRL SEEING MY AIM OBEYED ME IN ORDER TO PROVE HER GRATITUDE I HAD SUCCEEDED WITHOUT EFFORT OR TROUBLE IN ALMOST ISOLATING HER FROM HER FORMER HABITS MY DOCTOR
374-180298-0031 MARGUERITE GOT ACCUSTOMED TO THIS NEW EXISTENCE WHOSE SALUTARY EFFECTS SHE ALREADY REALIZED SHE BEGAN TO SPEND SOME OF HER EVENINGS AT HOME OR IF THE WEATHER WAS FINE SHE WRAPPED HERSELF IN A SHAWL PUT ON A VEIL AND WE WENT ON FOOT
374-180298-0032 LIKE TWO CHILDREN IN THE DIM ALLEYS OF THE CHAMPS ELYSEES SHE WOULD COME IN TIRED TAKE A LIGHT SUPPER AND GO TO BED AFTER A LITTLE MUSIC OR READING WHICH SHE HAD NEVER BEEN USED TO DO THE COUGH
374-180298-0034 UNDER THE PRETEXT THAT SHE WAS ASLEEP AND HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT SHE WAS NOT TO BE AWAKENED THE HABIT OR THE NEED OF SEEING ME WHICH MARGUERITE HAD NOW CONTRACTED HAD THIS GOOD RESULT THAT IT FORCED ME TO LEAVE THE GAMING TABLE JUST AT THE MOMENT
374-180298-0035 WHEN AN ADROIT GAMBLER WOULD HAVE LEFT IT SETTLING ONE THING AGAINST ANOTHER I FOUND MYSELF IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS
374-180298-0037 ALWAYS REPEATING THAT I WAS QUITE WELL AND THAT I WAS NOT IN NEED OF MONEY TWO THINGS WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD CONSOLE MY FATHER FOR MY DELAY IN PAYING HIM MY ANNUAL VISIT JUST THEN ONE FINE DAY IN SUMMER
374-180298-0038 MARGUERITE WAS AWAKENED BY THE SUNLIGHT POURING INTO HER ROOM AND JUMPING OUT OF BED ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE HER INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE WHOLE DAY
374-180298-0040 PRUDENCE WAS ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO SEEM MADE ON PURPOSE FOR DAYS IN THE COUNTRY WITH HER UNCHANGING GOOD HUMOUR AND HER ETERNAL APPETITE SHE NEVER LEFT A DULL MOMENT TO THOSE WHOM SHE WAS WITH AND WAS PERFECTLY HAPPY IN ORDERING EGGS CHERRIES MILK
374-180298-0041 STEWED RABBIT AND ALL THE REST OF THE TRADITIONAL LUNCH IN THE COUNTRY WE HAD NOW ONLY TO DECIDE WHERE WE SHOULD GO IT WAS ONCE MORE PRUDENCE WHO SETTLED THE DIFFICULTY DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE REAL COUNTRY SHE ASKED YES
374-180298-0043 THERE IS A MAGNIFICENT VIEW FROM THE GARDEN WHICH IS AT THE HEIGHT OF AN ORDINARY FIRST FLOOR ON THE LEFT THE AQUEDUCT OF MARLY CLOSES IN THE HORIZON
374-180298-0044 BEYOND DISTINCT IN THE SUNLIGHT RISE LITTLE WHITE HOUSES WITH RED ROOFS AND MANUFACTORIES WHICH AT THAT DISTANCE PUT AN ADMIRABLE FINISH TO THE LANDSCAPE BEYOND THAT PARIS IN THE MIST
374-180298-0046 I HAVE TRAVELLED A GOOD DEAL AND SEEN MUCH GRANDER THINGS
374-180298-0047 THE BREEZE THE SHINING SOLITUDE OF FIELDS OR WOODS HOWEVER MUCH ONE LOVES A WOMAN WHATEVER CONFIDENCE ONE MAY HAVE IN HER WHATEVER CERTAINTY HER PAST MAY OFFER US AS TO HER FUTURE ONE IS ALWAYS MORE OR LESS JEALOUS
374-180298-0049 AND OF HER UNITY AT THE CONTACT OF MEN AND THINGS AS FOR ME I EXPERIENCED THAT MORE THAN MOST MINE WAS NOT AN ORDINARY LOVE I WAS AS MUCH IN LOVE AS AN ORDINARY CREATURE COULD BE
374-180298-0050 AND WHO HAD NO CONCERN WITH US ALONE WITH NATURE IN THE SPRING TIME OF THE YEAR THAT ANNUAL PARDON AND SHUT OFF FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY I COULD HIDE MY LOVE AND LOVE WITHOUT SHAME OR FEAR
374-180298-0052 THE SUN SHONE UPON MY MISTRESS AS IT MIGHT HAVE SHONE UPON THE PUREST BRIDE WE WALKED TOGETHER IN THOSE CHARMING SPOTS WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MADE ON PURPOSE TO RECALL THE VERSES OF LAMARTINE OR TO SING THE MELODIES OF SCUDO
374-180298-0053 MARGUERITE WAS DRESSED IN WHITE SHE LEANED ON MY ARM SAYING OVER TO ME AGAIN UNDER THE STARRY SKY THE WORDS SHE HAD SAID TO ME THE DAY BEFORE AND FAR OFF THE WORLD WENT ON ITS WAY
374-180298-0055 AND BEHIND THE HOUSE A LITTLE WOOD FULL OF MYSTERIOUS RETREATS WHERE THE MOSS MUST EFFACE EACH MORNING THE PATHWAY THAT HAD BEEN MADE THE DAY BEFORE CLIMBING FLOWERS CLUNG ABOUT THE DOORWAY OF THIS UNINHABITED HOUSE
374-180298-0056 MOUNTING AS HIGH AS THE FIRST STORY I LOOKED AT THE HOUSE SO LONG THAT I BEGAN BY THINKING OF IT AS MINE SO PERFECTLY DID IT EMBODY THE DREAM THAT I WAS DREAMING I SAW MARGUERITE AND MYSELF THERE
374-180298-0058 WHERE ASKED PRUDENCE YONDER AND MARGUERITE POINTED TO THE HOUSE IN QUESTION AH DELICIOUS REPLIED PRUDENCE DO YOU LIKE IT VERY MUCH
374-180298-0059 WELL TELL THE DUKE TO TAKE IT FOR YOU HE WOULD DO SO I AM SURE I'LL SEE ABOUT IT IF YOU LIKE MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME
374-180298-0061 YES AN EXCELLENT IDEA I STAMMERED NOT KNOWING WHAT I WAS SAYING WELL I WILL ARRANGE THAT SAID MARGUERITE FREEING MY HAND AND INTERPRETING MY WORDS ACCORDING TO HER OWN DESIRE
374-180298-0062 LET US GO AND SEE IF IT IS TO LET THE HOUSE WAS EMPTY AND TO LET FOR TWO THOUSAND FRANCS WOULD YOU BE HAPPY HERE SHE SAID TO ME AM I SURE OF COMING HERE
374-180298-0064 YOU KNOW PERFECTLY WELL THAT I HAVE NO RIGHT TO ACCEPT IT SAVE FROM ONE MAN LET ME ALONE BIG BABY AND SAY NOTHING THAT MEANS SAID PRUDENCE THAT WHEN I HAVE TWO DAYS FREE I WILL COME AND SPEND THEM WITH YOU
374-180298-0065 WE LEFT THE HOUSE AND STARTED ON OUR RETURN TO PARIS TALKING OVER THE NEW PLAN
374-180299-0001 IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY I RECEIVED THIS NOTE
374-180299-0002 BE AT PRUDENCE'S TO NIGHT AT EIGHT
374-180299-0004 BUT THAT IS NOT ALL CONTINUED MARGUERITE WHAT ELSE IS THERE I HAVE BEEN SEEING ABOUT A PLACE FOR ARMAND TO STAY IN THE SAME HOUSE ASKED PRUDENCE LAUGHING
374-180299-0005 NO AT POINT DU JOUR WHERE WE HAD DINNER THE DUKE AND I
374-180299-0007 HE HAS ASKED ME HOW I LOVING PARIS AS I DO COULD MAKE UP MY MIND TO BURY MYSELF IN THE COUNTRY I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS ILL AND THAT I WANTED REST HE SEEMED TO HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN BELIEVING ME
374-180299-0008 AND WE SHALL HAVE EVERYTHING PERFECT THE DUKE IS GOING TO LOOK AFTER EVERY SINGLE THING AH MY DEAR SHE ADDED KISSING ME YOU'RE IN LUCK IT'S A MILLIONAIRE WHO MAKES YOUR BED FOR YOU
374-180299-0010 A WEEK LATER MARGUERITE WAS SETTLED IN HER COUNTRY HOUSE AND I WAS INSTALLED AT POINT DU JOUR THEN BEGAN AN EXISTENCE WHICH I SHALL HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY IN DESCRIBING TO YOU
374-180299-0011 PRUDENCE ON HER SIDE BROUGHT DOWN ALL THE PEOPLE SHE KNEW AND DID THE HONOURS OF THE HOUSE AS IF THE HOUSE BELONGED TO HER THE DUKE'S MONEY PAID FOR ALL THAT AS YOU MAY IMAGINE BUT FROM TIME TO TIME PRUDENCE CAME TO ME
374-180299-0013 AND FEARING LEST SHE SHOULD REQUIRE MORE THAN I POSSESSED I BORROWED AT PARIS A SUM EQUAL TO THAT WHICH I HAD ALREADY BORROWED AND PAID BACK I WAS THEN ONCE MORE IN POSSESSION OF SOME TEN THOUSAND FRANCS WITHOUT RECKONING MY ALLOWANCE
374-180299-0014 HOWEVER MARGUERITE'S PLEASURE IN SEEING HER FRIENDS WAS A LITTLE MODERATED WHEN SHE SAW THE EXPENSE WHICH THAT PLEASURE ENTAILED AND ESPECIALLY THE NECESSITY SHE WAS SOMETIMES IN OF ASKING ME FOR MONEY THE DUKE
374-180299-0016 MARGUERITE ROSE FROM TABLE AND JOINED THE DUKE IN THE NEXT ROOM WHERE SHE TRIED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE TO INDUCE HIM TO FORGET THE INCIDENT BUT THE OLD MAN WOUNDED IN HIS DIGNITY BORE HER A GRUDGE FOR IT
374-180299-0017 AND COULD NOT FORGIVE HER HE SAID TO HER SOMEWHAT CRUELLY THAT HE WAS TIRED OF PAYING FOR THE FOLLIES OF A WOMAN WHO COULD NOT EVEN HAVE HIM TREATED WITH RESPECT UNDER HIS OWN ROOF AND HE WENT AWAY IN GREAT INDIGNATION
374-180299-0019 FAR THAT MY MISTRESS NOW BELONGED TO ME MORE COMPLETELY AND MY DREAM WAS AT LENGTH REALIZED MARGUERITE COULD NOT BE WITHOUT ME NOT CARING WHAT THE RESULT MIGHT BE SHE PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED OUR LIAISON
374-180299-0020 AND I HAD COME TO LIVE ENTIRELY AT HER HOUSE THE SERVANTS ADDRESSED ME OFFICIALLY AS THEIR MASTER PRUDENCE HAD STRICTLY SERMONIZED MARGUERITE IN REGARD TO HER NEW MANNER OF LIFE BUT SHE HAD REPLIED THAT SHE LOVED ME THAT SHE COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT ME
374-180299-0022 THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL HER AND I HAD LISTENED AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM INTO WHICH THEY HAD SHUT THEMSELVES NOT LONG AFTER PRUDENCE RETURNED AGAIN I WAS AT THE OTHER END OF THE GARDEN WHEN SHE ARRIVED AND SHE DID NOT SEE ME
374-180299-0023 WELL SAID MARGUERITE WELL I HAVE SEEN THE DUKE WHAT DID HE SAY THAT HE WOULD GLADLY FORGIVE YOU IN REGARD TO THE SCENE WHICH TOOK PLACE
374-180299-0025 AND YOU REPLIED THAT I WOULD REPORT HIS DECISION TO YOU AND I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BRING YOU INTO A MORE REASONABLE FRAME OF MIND ONLY THINK MY DEAR CHILD OF THE POSITION THAT YOU ARE LOSING
374-180299-0026 AND THAT ARMAND CAN NEVER GIVE YOU HE LOVES YOU WITH ALL HIS SOUL BUT HE HAS NO FORTUNE CAPABLE OF SUPPLYING YOUR NEEDS AND HE WILL BE BOUND TO LEAVE YOU ONE DAY WHEN IT WILL BE TOO LATE AND WHEN THE DUKE WILL REFUSE TO DO ANY MORE FOR YOU
374-180299-0028 AND I WILL NOT CONCEAL THE FACT THAT I AM LIVING WITH HIM IT IS FOLLY NO DOUBT BUT I LOVE HIM WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO AND THEN NOW THAT HE HAS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO BE ALWAYS WITH ME
374-180299-0029 I WILL DO WITHOUT IT BUT WHAT WILL YOU DO I DON'T IN THE LEAST KNOW PRUDENCE WAS NO DOUBT GOING TO MAKE SOME REPLY BUT I ENTERED SUDDENLY AND FLUNG MYSELF AT MARGUERITE'S FEET
374-180299-0031 NO MORE BARRIERS MY MARGUERITE WE LOVE WHAT MATTERS ALL THE REST OH YES I LOVE YOU MY ARMAND SHE MURMURED PUTTING HER TWO ARMS AROUND MY NECK I LOVE YOU AS I NEVER THOUGHT I SHOULD EVER LOVE
374-180299-0032 AND I WILL SAY GOOD BYE FOREVER TO THE LIFE FOR WHICH I NOW BLUSH YOU WON'T EVER REPROACH ME FOR THE PAST TELL ME TEARS CHOKED MY VOICE I COULD ONLY REPLY BY CLASPING MARGUERITE TO MY HEART WELL
374-180299-0034 MARGUERITE WAS NO LONGER THE SAME WOMAN THAT I HAD KNOWN SHE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT MIGHT RECALL TO ME THE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD BEEN LEADING WHEN I FIRST MET HER NEVER DID WIFE OR SISTER SURROUND HUSBAND OR BROTHER WITH SUCH LOVING CARE AS SHE HAD FOR ME
374-180299-0035 ANY ONE WHO HAD SEEN US LEAVING THE HOUSE TO GO ON THE RIVER IN THE CHARMING LITTLE BOAT WHICH I HAD BOUGHT WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE WOMAN DRESSED IN WHITE WEARING A STRAW HAT
374-180299-0037 FOR TWO MONTHS WE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN TO PARIS NO ONE CAME TO SEE US EXCEPT PRUDENCE AND JULIE DUPRAT OF WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU
374-180299-0038 I PASSED WHOLE DAYS AT THE FEET OF MY MISTRESS WE OPENED THE WINDOWS UPON THE GARDEN AND AS WE WATCHED THE SUMMER RIPENING IN ITS FLOWERS
374-180299-0040 AFTER A BUTTERFLY OR A DRAGON FLY THIS COURTESAN WHO HAD COST MORE MONEY IN BOUQUETS THAN WOULD HAVE KEPT A WHOLE FAMILY IN COMFORT WOULD SOMETIMES SIT ON THE GRASS FOR AN HOUR EXAMINING THE SIMPLE FLOWER WHOSE NAME SHE BORE
374-180299-0041 IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT SHE READ MANON LESCAUT OVER AND OVER AGAIN I FOUND HER SEVERAL TIMES MAKING NOTES IN THE BOOK AND SHE ALWAYS DECLARED THAT WHEN A WOMAN LOVES SHE CAN NOT DO AS MANON DID
374-180299-0043 HE WOULD BRING HER BACK TO HIM BUT WHEN HE HAD PERCEIVED THE USELESSNESS OF THESE MEANS HE COULD HOLD OUT NO LONGER
374-180299-0044 AS BEFORE NO MATTER ON WHAT CONDITIONS I READ THESE URGENT AND REPEATED LETTERS AND TORE THEM IN PIECES WITHOUT TELLING MARGUERITE WHAT THEY CONTAINED AND WITHOUT ADVISING HER TO SEE THE OLD MAN AGAIN
374-180299-0046 I FEARED ABOVE ALL THAT SHE MIGHT THINK ME CAPABLE OF SHIRKING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF EVERY CONSEQUENCE TO WHICH HER LOVE FOR ME MIGHT LEAD HER IT THUS CAME ABOUT THAT THE DUKE RECEIVING NO REPLY CEASED TO WRITE
403-216-0000 A FEW DAYS PASSED AWAY AND CATHERINE THOUGH NOT ALLOWING HERSELF TO SUSPECT HER FRIEND COULD NOT HELP WATCHING HER CLOSELY THE RESULT OF HER OBSERVATIONS WAS NOT AGREEABLE
403-216-0002 THAT MIGHT ONLY HAVE SPREAD A NEW GRACE AND INSPIRED A WARMER INTEREST BUT WHEN CATHERINE SAW HER IN PUBLIC ADMITTING CAPTAIN TILNEY'S ATTENTIONS AS READILY AS THEY WERE OFFERED
403-216-0003 BUT IT WAS A DEGREE OF WILFUL THOUGHTLESSNESS WHICH CATHERINE COULD NOT BUT RESENT JAMES WAS THE SUFFERER SHE SAW HIM GRAVE AND UNEASY AND HOWEVER CARELESS OF HIS PRESENT COMFORT
403-216-0005 SHE WISHED BY A GENTLE REMONSTRANCE TO REMIND ISABELLA OF HER SITUATION AND MAKE HER AWARE OF THIS DOUBLE UNKINDNESS BUT FOR REMONSTRANCE EITHER OPPORTUNITY OR COMPREHENSION WAS ALWAYS AGAINST HER
403-216-0006 IF ABLE TO SUGGEST A HINT ISABELLA COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND IT IN THIS DISTRESS THE INTENDED DEPARTURE OF THE TILNEY FAMILY BECAME HER CHIEF CONSOLATION THEIR JOURNEY INTO GLOUCESTERSHIRE WAS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW DAYS
403-216-0008 WHEN CATHERINE KNEW THIS HER RESOLUTION WAS DIRECTLY MADE SHE SPOKE TO HENRY TILNEY ON THE SUBJECT REGRETTING HIS BROTHER'S EVIDENT PARTIALITY FOR MISS THORPE AND ENTREATING HIM TO MAKE KNOWN HER PRIOR ENGAGEMENT
403-216-0009 MY BROTHER DOES KNOW IT WAS HENRY'S ANSWER DOES HE THEN WHY DOES HE STAY HERE HE MADE NO REPLY AND WAS BEGINNING TO TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE BUT SHE EAGERLY CONTINUED
403-216-0011 HENRY SMILED AND SAID I AM SURE MY BROTHER WOULD NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEN YOU WILL PERSUADE HIM TO GO AWAY PERSUASION IS NOT AT COMMAND BUT PARDON ME
403-216-0012 I HAVE MYSELF TOLD HIM THAT MISS THORPE IS ENGAGED HE KNOWS WHAT HE IS ABOUT AND MUST BE HIS OWN MASTER NO HE DOES NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS ABOUT CRIED CATHERINE HE DOES NOT KNOW THE PAIN HE IS GIVING MY BROTHER
403-216-0014 OR MISS THORPE'S ADMISSION OF THEM THAT GIVES THE PAIN
403-216-0015 I THINK MISTER MORLAND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE A DIFFERENCE NO MAN IS OFFENDED BY ANOTHER MAN'S ADMIRATION OF THE WOMAN HE LOVES IT IS THE WOMAN ONLY WHO CAN MAKE IT A TORMENT CATHERINE BLUSHED FOR HER FRIEND AND SAID
403-216-0017 YOU KNOW SHE MUST BE ATTACHED TO HIM I UNDERSTAND
403-216-0018 AFTER A SHORT PAUSE CATHERINE RESUMED WITH THEN YOU DO NOT BELIEVE ISABELLA SO VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MY BROTHER I CAN HAVE NO OPINION ON THAT SUBJECT BUT WHAT CAN YOUR BROTHER MEAN
403-216-0020 YES I THINK SO FOR YOU MUST KNOW YOUR BROTHER'S HEART MY BROTHER'S HEART AS YOU TERM IT ON THE PRESENT OCCASION I ASSURE YOU I CAN ONLY GUESS AT WELL
403-216-0021 WELL NAY IF IT IS TO BE GUESSWORK LET US ALL GUESS FOR OURSELVES TO BE GUIDED BY SECOND HAND CONJECTURE IS PITIFUL THE PREMISES ARE BEFORE YOU
403-216-0023 SURE IF YOUR FATHER WERE TO SPEAK TO HIM HE WOULD GO MY DEAR MISS MORLAND SAID HENRY IN THIS AMIABLE SOLICITUDE FOR YOUR BROTHER'S COMFORT MAY YOU NOT BE A LITTLE MISTAKEN
403-216-0024 ARE YOU NOT CARRIED A LITTLE TOO FAR WOULD HE THANK YOU EITHER ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT OR MISS THORPE'S FOR SUPPOSING THAT HER AFFECTION OR AT LEAST HER GOOD BEHAVIOUR IS ONLY TO BE SECURED BY HER SEEING NOTHING OF CAPTAIN TILNEY
403-216-0026 PERCEIVING HER STILL TO LOOK DOUBTFUL AND GRAVE HE ADDED THOUGH FREDERICK DOES NOT LEAVE BATH WITH US HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN BUT A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS ONLY A FEW DAYS BEHIND US
403-216-0027 HIS LEAVE OF ABSENCE WILL SOON EXPIRE AND HE MUST RETURN TO HIS REGIMENT AND WHAT WILL THEN BE THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
403-126855-0000 THE SEVENTH CHAPTER
403-126855-0001 THE BRIDGE OF APES QUEEN ERMINTRUDE HAD NEVER IN HER LIFE SEEN HER HUSBAND SO TERRIBLE AS HE GOT THAT NIGHT HE GNASHED HIS TEETH WITH RAGE
403-126855-0003 THEN HE MADE ALL HIS SERVANTS GO TOO HIS COOKS AND HIS GARDENERS AND HIS BARBER AND PRINCE BUMPO'S TUTOR EVEN THE QUEEN WHO WAS TIRED FROM DANCING IN A PAIR OF TIGHT SHOES
403-126855-0004 WAS PACKED OFF TO HELP THE SOLDIERS IN THEIR SEARCH ALL THIS TIME THE DOCTOR AND HIS ANIMALS WERE RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST TOWARDS THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS AS FAST AS THEY COULD GO GUB GUB
403-126855-0006 THOUGHT IT WOULD BE EASY FOR HIS ARMY TO FIND THEM BECAUSE THE DOCTOR WAS IN A STRANGE LAND AND WOULD NOT KNOW HIS WAY BUT HE WAS WRONG BECAUSE THE MONKEY CHEE CHEE KNEW ALL THE PATHS THROUGH THE JUNGLE BETTER EVEN THAN THE KING'S MEN DID
403-126855-0007 AND HE LED THE DOCTOR AND HIS PETS TO THE VERY THICKEST PART OF THE FOREST A PLACE WHERE NO MAN HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE AND HID THEM ALL IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE BETWEEN HIGH ROCKS
403-126855-0009 AT LAST WHEN DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO COME THROUGH THE THICK LEAVES OVERHEAD THEY HEARD QUEEN ERMINTRUDE SAYING IN A VERY TIRED VOICE THAT IT WAS NO USE LOOKING ANY MORE THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL GO BACK AND GET SOME SLEEP
403-126855-0010 AND THEY SET OFF FOR THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS IT WAS A LONG LONG WAY AND THEY OFTEN GOT VERY TIRED ESPECIALLY GUB GUB BUT WHEN HE CRIED THEY GAVE HIM MILK OUT OF THE COCOANUTS
403-126855-0012 AND ENJOYED THE LIFE OF TRAVEL VERY MUCH BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS GLAD WHEN THE NIGHT CAME AND THEY STOPPED FOR THEIR RESTING TIME THEN THE DOCTOR USED TO MAKE A LITTLE FIRE OF STICKS
403-126855-0013 THEY WOULD SIT ROUND IT IN A RING LISTENING TO POLYNESIA SINGING SONGS ABOUT THE SEA OR TO CHEE CHEE TELLING STORIES OF THE JUNGLE AND MANY OF THE TALES THAT CHEE CHEE TOLD WERE VERY INTERESTING
403-126855-0015 OF THE DAYS WHEN MEN DRESSED IN BEAR SKINS AND LIVED IN HOLES IN THE ROCK AND ATE THEIR MUTTON RAW BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT COOKING WAS HAVING NEVER SEEN A FIRE
403-126855-0016 AND HE TOLD THEM OF THE GREAT MAMMOTHS AND LIZARDS AS LONG AS A TRAIN THAT WANDERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN THOSE TIMES NIBBLING FROM THE TREE TOPS AND OFTEN THEY GOT SO INTERESTED LISTENING
403-126855-0018 THESE MONKEYS MADE A TREMENDOUS NOISE CHEERING AND WAVING LEAVES AND SWINGING OUT OF THE BRANCHES TO GREET HIM THEY WANTED TO CARRY HIS BAG AND HIS TRUNK AND EVERYTHING HE HAD AND ONE OF THE BIGGER ONES EVEN CARRIED GUB GUB
403-126855-0019 HAD HEARD THE NOISE OF THE MONKEYS CHEERING AND THEY AT LAST KNEW WHERE THE DOCTOR WAS AND HASTENED ON TO CATCH HIM THE BIG MONKEY CARRYING GUB GUB WAS COMING ALONG BEHIND SLOWLY
403-126855-0021 COMING AFTER THEM BEGAN TO RUN TOO AND THE CAPTAIN RAN HARDEST OF ALL THEN THE DOCTOR TRIPPED OVER HIS MEDICINE BAG AND FELL DOWN IN THE MUD AND THE CAPTAIN THOUGHT HE WOULD SURELY CATCH HIM THIS TIME
403-126855-0022 BUT THE CAPTAIN HAD VERY LONG EARS THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS VERY SHORT AND AS HE SPRANG FORWARD TO TAKE HOLD OF THE DOCTOR ONE OF HIS EARS CAUGHT FAST IN A TREE
403-126855-0024 BUT BEFORE THEY COULD GET INTO THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS THEY CAME TO A STEEP CLIFF WITH A RIVER FLOWING BELOW THIS WAS THE END OF THE KINGDOM OF JOLLIGINKI
403-126855-0025 AND THE LAND OF THE MONKEYS WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE ACROSS THE RIVER AND JIP THE DOG LOOKED DOWN OVER THE EDGE OF THE STEEP STEEP CLIFF AND SAID GOLLY HOW ARE WE EVER GOING TO GET ACROSS
403-126855-0027 THEY'VE GOT THE CAPTAIN LOOSE AND HE'S COMING ON LIKE A DEER GET LIVELY
403-126855-0028 WAS A BRIDGE ALL READY FOR HIM MADE OF LIVING MONKEYS FOR WHILE HIS BACK WAS TURNED THE MONKEYS QUICK AS A FLASH HAD MADE THEMSELVES INTO A BRIDGE
403-126855-0030 AND SO DID ALL OF THEM JOHN DOLITTLE WAS THE LAST TO CROSS AND JUST AS HE WAS GETTING TO THE OTHER SIDE THE KING'S MEN CAME RUSHING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF THEN THEY SHOOK THEIR FISTS AND YELLED WITH RAGE
403-126855-0031 MANY GREAT EXPLORERS AND GRAY BEARDED NATURALISTS HAVE LAIN LONG WEEKS HIDDEN IN THE JUNGLE WAITING TO SEE THE MONKEYS DO THAT TRICK BUT WE NEVER LET A WHITE MAN GET A GLIMPSE OF IT BEFORE YOU ARE THE FIRST TO SEE THE FAMOUS BRIDGE OF APES
403-128339-0001 COME OUT AND LISTEN TO THE EVENING PAPER YOU INSIDE THERE CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY SO AT LAST BEGAN THE EVENING PAPER AT LA FORCE
403-128339-0002 CHARLES EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY HAD REASON TO KNOW THE USAGE HE HAD SEEN HUNDREDS PASS AWAY SO
403-128339-0004 EVERY HUMAN CREATURE HE HAD SINCE CARED FOR AND PARTED WITH HAD DIED ON THE SCAFFOLD THERE WERE HURRIED WORDS OF FAREWELL AND KINDNESS BUT THE PARTING WAS SOON OVER IT WAS THE INCIDENT OF EVERY DAY
403-128339-0005 AND A LITTLE CONCERT FOR THAT EVENING THEY CROWDED TO THE GRATES AND SHED TEARS THERE BUT TWENTY PLACES IN THE PROJECTED ENTERTAINMENTS HAD TO BE REFILLED AND THE TIME WAS AT BEST SHORT TO THE LOCK UP HOUR
403-128339-0007 BUT A WILD INFECTION OF THE WILDLY SHAKEN PUBLIC MIND IN SEASONS OF PESTILENCE SOME OF US WILL HAVE A SECRET ATTRACTION TO THE DISEASE A TERRIBLE PASSING INCLINATION TO DIE OF IT
403-128339-0008 AND ALL OF US HAVE LIKE WONDERS HIDDEN IN OUR BREASTS ONLY NEEDING CIRCUMSTANCES TO EVOKE THEM THE PASSAGE TO THE CONCIERGERIE WAS SHORT AND DARK
403-128339-0010 SOME DAGGERS SOME ATE AND DRANK AS THEY LOOKED ON MANY KNITTED AMONG THESE LAST WAS ONE WITH A SPARE PIECE OF KNITTING UNDER HER ARM AS SHE WORKED SHE WAS IN A FRONT ROW BY THE SIDE OF A MAN
403-128339-0011 BUT WHAT HE MOST NOTICED IN THE TWO FIGURES WAS THAT ALTHOUGH THEY WERE POSTED AS CLOSE TO HIMSELF AS THEY COULD BE THEY NEVER LOOKED TOWARDS HIM THEY SEEMED TO BE WAITING FOR SOMETHING WITH A DOGGED DETERMINATION
403-128339-0013 WHO WORE THEIR USUAL CLOTHES AND HAD NOT ASSUMED THE COARSE GARB
403-128339-0014 WHOSE LIFE WAS FORFEIT TO THE REPUBLIC UNDER THE DECREE WHICH BANISHED ALL EMIGRANTS ON PAIN OF DEATH IT WAS NOTHING THAT THE DECREE BORE DATE SINCE HIS RETURN TO FRANCE THERE HE WAS AND THERE WAS THE DECREE
403-128339-0016 UNDOUBTEDLY IT WAS WAS HE NOT AN EMIGRANT THEN WHAT DID HE CALL HIMSELF NOT AN EMIGRANT HE HOPED WITHIN THE SENSE AND SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHY NOT THE PRESIDENT DESIRED TO KNOW
403-128339-0017 BECAUSE HE HAD VOLUNTARILY RELINQUISHED A TITLE THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND A STATION THAT WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM AND HAD LEFT HIS COUNTRY HE SUBMITTED BEFORE THE WORD EMIGRANT IN THE PRESENT ACCEPTATION BY THE TRIBUNAL WAS IN USE
403-128339-0019 THE PRESIDENT REMINDED HIM TRUE BUT NOT AN ENGLISH WOMAN A CITIZENESS OF FRANCE YES BY BIRTH HER NAME AND FAMILY
403-128339-0020 LUCIE MANETTE ONLY DAUGHTER OF DOCTOR MANETTE THE GOOD PHYSICIAN WHO SITS THERE THIS ANSWER HAD A HAPPY EFFECT UPON THE AUDIENCE CRIES IN EXALTATION OF THE WELL KNOWN GOOD PHYSICIAN RENT THE HALL
403-128339-0022 AND HAD PREPARED EVERY INCH OF HIS ROAD THE PRESIDENT ASKED WHY HAD HE RETURNED TO FRANCE WHEN HE DID AND NOT SOONER HE HAD NOT RETURNED SOONER HE REPLIED SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO MEANS OF LIVING IN FRANCE SAVE THOSE HE HAD RESIGNED
403-128339-0023 WHEREAS IN ENGLAND HE LIVED BY GIVING INSTRUCTION IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE HE HAD RETURNED WHEN HE DID ON THE PRESSING AND WRITTEN ENTREATY OF A FRENCH CITIZEN WHO REPRESENTED THAT HIS LIFE WAS ENDANGERED BY HIS ABSENCE
403-128339-0025 NO AND THE PRESIDENT RANG HIS BELL TO QUIET THEM WHICH IT DID NOT FOR THEY CONTINUED TO CRY NO
403-128339-0026 THE PRESIDENT REQUIRED THE NAME OF THAT CITIZEN THE ACCUSED EXPLAINED THAT THE CITIZEN WAS HIS FIRST WITNESS HE ALSO REFERRED WITH CONFIDENCE TO THE CITIZEN'S LETTER WHICH HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM HIM AT THE BARRIER
403-128339-0028 THAT IN THE PRESSURE OF BUSINESS IMPOSED ON THE TRIBUNAL BY THE MULTITUDE OF ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC WITH WHICH IT HAD TO DEAL HE HAD BEEN SLIGHTLY OVERLOOKED IN HIS PRISON OF THE ABBAYE IN FACT
403-128339-0029 BY THE SURRENDER OF THE CITIZEN EVREMONDE CALLED DARNAY DOCTOR MANETTE WAS NEXT QUESTIONED HIS HIGH PERSONAL POPULARITY AND THE CLEARNESS OF HIS ANSWERS MADE A GREAT IMPRESSION
403-128339-0031 SO FAR FROM BEING IN FAVOUR WITH THE ARISTOCRAT GOVERNMENT THERE HE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TRIED FOR HIS LIFE BY IT AS THE FOE OF ENGLAND AND FRIEND OF THE UNITED STATES AS HE BROUGHT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INTO VIEW WITH THE GREATEST DISCRETION
403-128339-0032 AND WITH THE STRAIGHTFORWARD FORCE OF TRUTH AND EARNESTNESS THE JURY AND THE POPULACE BECAME ONE AT LAST WHEN HE APPEALED BY NAME TO MONSIEUR LORRY AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN THEN AND THERE PRESENT WHO LIKE HIMSELF
403-128339-0034 THE JURYMEN VOTED ALOUD AND INDIVIDUALLY THE POPULACE SET UP A SHOUT OF APPLAUSE ALL THE VOICES WERE IN THE PRISONER'S FAVOUR AND THE PRESIDENT DECLARED HIM FREE
403-128339-0035 THEN BEGAN ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY SCENES WITH WHICH THE POPULACE SOMETIMES GRATIFIED THEIR FICKLENESS OR THEIR BETTER IMPULSES TOWARDS GENEROSITY AND MERCY
403-128339-0037 WITH THE SECOND PREDOMINATING NO SOONER WAS THE ACQUITTAL PRONOUNCED THAN TEARS WERE SHED AS FREELY AS BLOOD AT ANOTHER TIME AND SUCH FRATERNAL EMBRACES WERE BESTOWED UPON THE PRISONER BY AS MANY OF BOTH SEXES AS COULD RUSH AT HIM
403-128339-0038 THAT AFTER HIS LONG AND UNWHOLESOME CONFINEMENT HE WAS IN DANGER OF FAINTING FROM EXHAUSTION NONE THE LESS BECAUSE HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT THE VERY SAME PEOPLE CARRIED BY ANOTHER CURRENT WOULD HAVE RUSHED AT HIM WITH THE VERY SAME INTENSITY
403-128339-0040 FIVE WERE TO BE TRIED TOGETHER NEXT AS ENEMIES OF THE REPUBLIC FORASMUCH AS THEY HAD NOT ASSISTED IT BY WORD OR DEED SO QUICK WAS THE TRIBUNAL TO COMPENSATE ITSELF AND THE NATION FOR A CHANCE LOST
403-128339-0041 THAT THESE FIVE CAME DOWN TO HIM BEFORE HE LEFT THE PLACE CONDEMNED TO DIE WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS THE FIRST OF THEM TOLD HIM SO WITH THE CUSTOMARY PRISON SIGN OF DEATH A RAISED FINGER AND THEY ALL ADDED IN WORDS
403-128339-0043 IN WHICH THERE SEEMED TO BE EVERY FACE HE HAD SEEN IN COURT EXCEPT TWO FOR WHICH HE LOOKED IN VAIN ON HIS COMING OUT THE CONCOURSE MADE AT HIM ANEW WEEPING EMBRACING AND SHOUTING ALL BY TURNS AND ALL TOGETHER
403-128339-0044 UNTIL THE VERY TIDE OF THE RIVER ON THE BANK OF WHICH THE MAD SCENE WAS ACTED SEEMED TO RUN MAD LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THE SHORE THEY PUT HIM INTO A GREAT CHAIR THEY HAD AMONG THEM
403-128339-0046 AND WHEN HER HUSBAND STOOD UPON HIS FEET SHE DROPPED INSENSIBLE IN HIS ARMS AS HE HELD HER TO HIS HEART AND TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL HEAD BETWEEN HIS FACE AND THE BRAWLING CROWD
403-128339-0047 SO THAT HIS TEARS AND HER LIPS MIGHT COME TOGETHER UNSEEN A FEW OF THE PEOPLE FELL TO DANCING
403-128339-0049 AND AFTER EMBRACING THE EVER ZEALOUS AND FAITHFUL PROSS WHO LIFTED HER HE TOOK HIS WIFE IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER UP TO THEIR ROOMS LUCIE MY OWN I AM SAFE O DEAREST CHARLES
403-128339-0050 LET ME THANK GOD FOR THIS ON MY KNEES AS I HAVE PRAYED TO HIM THEY ALL REVERENTLY BOWED THEIR HEADS AND HEARTS WHEN SHE WAS AGAIN IN HIS ARMS HE SAID TO HER
403-128339-0052 HE WAS PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH
405-130894-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN SHORTAGE OF AIR CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE BELOW AND AROUND THE NAUTILUS THERE WERE IMPENETRABLE FROZEN WALLS WE WERE THE ICE BANK'S PRISONERS THE CANADIAN BANGED A TABLE WITH HIS FEARSOME FIST
405-130894-0002 HE SAID IN A CALM VOICE THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF DYING UNDER THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH WE'RE PLACED THIS INEXPLICABLE INDIVIDUAL ACTED LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROFESSOR WORKING OUT A PROBLEM FOR HIS PUPILS THE FIRST WAY HE WENT ON
405-130894-0003 IS DEATH BY CRUSHING THE SECOND IS DEATH BY ASPHYXIATION I DON'T MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BY STARVATION BECAUSE THE NAUTILUS'S PROVISIONS WILL CERTAINLY LAST LONGER THAN WE WILL
405-130894-0005 BUT THEY'LL SUPPLY AIR FOR ONLY TWO DAYS NOW THEN WE'VE BEEN BURIED BENEATH THE WATERS FOR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND THE NAUTILUS'S HEAVY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY NEEDS RENEWING IN ANOTHER FORTY EIGHT HOURS OUR RESERVE AIR WILL BE USED UP
405-130894-0006 WELL THEN CAPTAIN LET'S FREE OURSELVES WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS WE'LL TRY TO AT LEAST BY CUTTING THROUGH ONE OF THESE WALLS SURROUNDING US WHICH ONE I ASKED BORINGS WILL TELL US THAT
405-130894-0008 HISSING SOUNDS SOON TOLD ME THAT WATER WAS BEING ADMITTED INTO THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS SLOWLY SETTLED AND RESTED ON THE ICY BOTTOM AT A DEPTH OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY METERS THE DEPTH AT WHICH THE LOWER SHELF OF ICE LAY SUBMERGED
405-130894-0009 MY FRIENDS I SAID WE'RE IN A SERIOUS PREDICAMENT BUT I'M COUNTING ON YOUR COURAGE AND ENERGY SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED THIS IS NO TIME TO BORE YOU WITH MY COMPLAINTS
405-130894-0011 WHICH WAS PROMPTLY ACCEPTED THE CANADIAN GOT INTO HIS UNDERWATER COSTUME AND WAS READY AS SOON AS HIS FELLOW WORKERS
405-130894-0012 AFTER NED WAS DRESSED I REENTERED THE LOUNGE WHOSE WINDOWS HAD BEEN UNCOVERED STATIONED NEXT TO CONSEIL I EXAMINED THE STRATA SURROUNDING AND SUPPORTING THE NAUTILUS SOME MOMENTS LATER WE SAW A DOZEN CREWMEN SET FOOT ON THE SHELF OF ICE
405-130894-0014 MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED METERS HIGH
405-130894-0015 THERE WE WERE SEPARATED FROM THE SEA BY A TEN METER BARRIER THAT'S HOW THICK THE ICEBERG WAS FROM THIS POINT ON IT WAS AN ISSUE OF CUTTING OUT A PIECE EQUAL IN SURFACE AREA TO THE NAUTILUS'S WATERLINE THIS MEANT DETACHING ABOUT
405-130894-0017 THEN HIS MEN SIMULTANEOUSLY STAKED IT OFF AT SEVERAL POINTS AROUND ITS CIRCUMFERENCE SOON THEIR PICKS WERE VIGOROUSLY ATTACKING THIS COMPACT MATTER AND HUGE CHUNKS WERE LOOSENED FROM ITS MASS
405-130894-0018 THESE CHUNKS WEIGHED LESS THAN THE WATER AND BY AN UNUSUAL EFFECT OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY EACH CHUNK TOOK WING AS IT WERE TO THE ROOF OF THE TUNNEL
405-130894-0020 THE NAUTILUS'S CHIEF OFFICER SUPERVISED US THE WATER STRUCK ME AS UNUSUALLY COLD BUT I WARMED UP PROMPTLY WHILE WIELDING MY PICK MY MOVEMENTS WERE QUITE FREE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE EXECUTED UNDER A PRESSURE OF THIRTY ATMOSPHERES
405-130894-0021 AND THE NAUTILUS'S ATMOSPHERE WHICH WAS ALREADY CHARGED WITH CARBON DIOXIDE THE AIR HADN'T BEEN RENEWED IN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND ITS LIFE GIVING QUALITIES WERE CONSIDERABLY WEAKENED MEANWHILE
405-130894-0023 BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD RETURN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES COULDN'T WE ALL DIE OF ASPHYXIATION WERE THIS SHIP AND EVERYONE ON BOARD DOOMED TO PERISH IN THIS TOMB OF ICE IT WAS A DREADFUL STATE OF AFFAIRS BUT WE FACED IT HEAD ON
405-130894-0024 EACH ONE OF US DETERMINED TO DO HIS DUTY TO THE END DURING THE NIGHT IN LINE WITH MY FORECASTS A NEW ONE METER SLICE WAS REMOVED FROM THIS IMMENSE SOCKET BUT IN THE MORNING WEARING MY DIVING SUIT
405-130894-0026 THERE WAS NO POINT IN DAMPENING THE ENERGY THEY WERE PUTTING INTO OUR ARDUOUS RESCUE WORK BUT WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD
405-130894-0027 I KNOW HE TOLD ME IN THAT CALM TONE THE MOST DREADFUL OUTLOOK COULDN'T CHANGE IT'S ONE MORE DANGER BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY WAY OF WARDING IT OFF OUR SOLE CHANCE FOR SALVATION
405-130894-0029 THE WORK KEPT ME GOING BESIDES WORKING MEANT LEAVING THE NAUTILUS WHICH MEANT BREATHING THE CLEAN OXYGEN DRAWN FROM THE AIR TANKS AND SUPPLIED BY OUR EQUIPMENT WHICH MEANT LEAVING THE THIN FOUL AIR BEHIND
405-130894-0030 NEAR EVENING ONE MORE METER HAD BEEN DUG FROM THE TRENCH WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I WAS WELLNIGH ASPHYXIATED BY THE CARBON DIOXIDE SATURATING THE AIR OH IF ONLY WE HAD THE CHEMICAL METHODS THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO DRIVE OUT THIS NOXIOUS GAS
405-130894-0032 THIS LIFE GIVING ELASTIC FLUID COULD HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO US I HAD THOUGHT IT ALL OUT BUT TO NO AVAIL BECAUSE THE CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCED BY OUR BREATHING PERMEATED EVERY PART OF THE SHIP TO ABSORB IT WE WOULD NEED TO FILL CONTAINERS WITH POTASSIUM HYDROXIDE
405-130894-0033 AND SHAKE THEM CONTINUALLY BUT THIS SUBSTANCE WAS MISSING ON BOARD AND NOTHING ELSE COULD REPLACE IT
405-130894-0035 OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD COME TOGETHER BEFORE THE NAUTILUS COULD BREAK FREE FOR AN INSTANT I WAS GRIPPED BY DESPAIR MY PICK NEARLY SLIPPED FROM MY HANDS WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS DIGGING IF I WAS TO DIE SMOTHERED AND CRUSHED BY THIS WATER TURNING TO STONE
405-130894-0036 A TORTURE UNDREAMED OF BY EVEN THE WILDEST SAVAGES I FELT LIKE I WAS LYING IN THE JAWS OF A FEARSOME MONSTER JAWS IRRESISTIBLY CLOSING SUPERVISING OUR WORK
405-130894-0038 THE CAPTAIN UNDERSTOOD AND GAVE ME A SIGNAL TO FOLLOW HIM WE RETURNED ON BOARD MY DIVING SUIT REMOVED I WENT WITH HIM TO THE LOUNGE PROFESSOR ARONNAX HE TOLD ME THIS CALLS FOR HEROIC MEASURES
405-130894-0039 OR WE'LL BE SEALED UP IN THIS SOLIDIFIED WATER AS IF IT WERE CEMENT YES I SAID BUT WHAT CAN WE DO OH HE EXCLAIMED
405-130894-0041 COULD COME TO OUR RESCUE DON'T YOU SEE THAT BY SOLIDIFYING IT COULD BURST THESE TRACTS OF ICE IMPRISONING US JUST AS ITS FREEZING CAN BURST THE HARDEST STONES AREN'T YOU AWARE THAT THIS FORCE COULD BE THE INSTRUMENT OF OUR SALVATION RATHER THAN OUR DESTRUCTION
405-130894-0042 I KNOW IT SIR SO WE CAN'T RELY ON NATURE TO RESCUE US ONLY OUR OWN EFFORTS WE MUST COUNTERACT THIS SOLIDIFICATION WE MUST HOLD IT IN CHECK NOT ONLY ARE THE SIDE WALLS CLOSING IN
405-130894-0044 IT WAS NOW THE TWENTY SIXTH WE HAD LIVED OFF THE SHIP'S STORES FOR FIVE DAYS AND ALL REMAINING BREATHABLE AIR HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN EVEN TODAY AS I WRITE THESE LINES MY SENSATIONS ARE SO INTENSE
405-130894-0045 THAT AN INVOLUNTARY TERROR SWEEPS OVER ME AND MY LUNGS STILL SEEM SHORT OF AIR MEANWHILE
405-130894-0047 IT'S WORTH TRYING I SAID RESOLUTELY SO LET'S TRY IT PROFESSOR
405-130894-0048 CAPTAIN NEMO LED ME TO THE GALLEY WHERE A HUGE DISTILLING MECHANISM WAS AT WORK SUPPLYING DRINKING WATER VIA EVAPORATION THE MECHANISM WAS LOADED WITH WATER AND THE FULL ELECTRIC HEAT OF OUR BATTERIES WAS THROWN INTO COILS AWASH IN LIQUID
405-130894-0050 BOILING HOT AT THE BODY OF THE PUMP THE STEAMING WATER WAS INJECTED INTO THE ICY WATER OUTSIDE AND AFTER THREE HOURS HAD PASSED
405-130894-0051 THAT WAS ONE DEGREE GAINED
405-130894-0053 THE INJECTIONS COULDN'T GET IT TO GO A SINGLE DEGREE HIGHER
405-130894-0054 I WAS FINALLY ASSURED THAT THERE WAS NO DANGER OF IT SOLIDIFYING BY THE NEXT DAY MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH SIX METERS OF ICE HAD BEEN TORN FROM THE SOCKET ONLY FOUR METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED THAT STILL MEANT FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF WORK
405-130894-0056 YAWNS DISLOCATED MY JAWS MY LUNGS WERE GASPING IN THEIR QUEST FOR THAT ENKINDLING ELASTIC FLUID REQUIRED FOR BREATHING NOW GROWING SCARCER AND SCARCER MY MIND WAS IN A DAZE I LAY OUTSTRETCHED STRENGTH GONE
405-130894-0057 NEARLY UNCONSCIOUS MY GALLANT CONSEIL FELT THE SAME SYMPTOMS SUFFERED THE SAME SUFFERINGS YET NEVER LEFT MY SIDE HE HELD MY HAND HE KEPT ENCOURAGING ME AND I EVEN HEARD HIM MUTTER
405-130894-0059 PICKS RANG OUT ON THAT BED OF ICE ARMS GREW WEARY HANDS WERE RUBBED RAW BUT WHO CARED ABOUT EXHAUSTION WHAT DIFFERENCE WERE WOUNDS LIFE SUSTAINING AIR REACHED OUR LUNGS WE COULD BREATHE WE COULD BREATHE
405-130894-0060 AND YET NOBODY PROLONGED HIS UNDERWATER WORK BEYOND THE TIME ALLOTTED HIM HIS SHIFT OVER EACH MAN SURRENDERED TO A GASPING COMPANION THE AIR TANK THAT WOULD REVIVE HIM
405-130894-0062 OVER THE WHOLE SURFACE AREA ONLY TWO METERS WERE LEFT TO BE REMOVED ONLY TWO METERS SEPARATED US FROM THE OPEN SEA BUT THE SHIP'S AIR TANKS WERE NEARLY EMPTY THE LITTLE AIR THAT REMAINED HAD TO BE SAVED FOR THE WORKMEN NOT AN
405-130894-0063 ATOM FOR THE NAUTILUS WHEN I RETURNED ON BOARD I FELT HALF SUFFOCATED WHAT A NIGHT I'M UNABLE TO DEPICT IT SUCH SUFFERINGS ARE INDESCRIBABLE THE NEXT DAY I WAS SHORT WINDED
405-130894-0065 AND HE DECIDED TO CRUSH THIS LAYER THE MAN HAD KEPT HIS ENERGY AND COMPOSURE HE HAD SUBDUED PHYSICAL PAIN WITH MORAL STRENGTH HE COULD STILL THINK PLAN AND ACT AT HIS ORDERS THE CRAFT WAS EASED OFF
405-130894-0066 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS RAISED FROM ITS ICY BED BY A CHANGE IN ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY WHEN IT WAS AFLOAT THE CREW TOWED IT LEADING IT RIGHT ABOVE THE IMMENSE TRENCH OUTLINED TO MATCH THE SHIP'S WATERLINE NEXT THE BALLAST TANKS FILLED WITH WATER
405-130894-0068 WE LISTENED WE FORGOT OUR SUFFERINGS WE HOPED ONCE MORE WE HAD STAKED OUR SALVATION ON THIS ONE LAST GAMBLE DESPITE THE BUZZING IN MY HEAD I SOON COULD HEAR VIBRATIONS UNDER THE NAUTILUS'S HULL WE TILTED
405-130894-0069 THE ICE CRACKED WITH AN ODD RIPPING SOUND LIKE PAPER TEARING AND THE NAUTILUS BEGAN SETTLING DOWNWARD WE'RE GOING THROUGH CONSEIL MUTTERED IN MY EAR I COULDN'T ANSWER HIM I CLUTCHED HIS HAND
405-130894-0071 OUR FULL ELECTRIC POWER WAS THEN PUT ON THE PUMPS WHICH INSTANTLY BEGAN TO EXPEL WATER FROM THE BALLAST TANKS AFTER A FEW MINUTES WE HAD CHECKED OUR FALL THE PRESSURE GAUGE SOON INDICATED AN ASCENDING MOVEMENT
405-130894-0072 BROUGHT TO FULL SPEED THE PROPELLER MADE THE SHEET IRON HULL TREMBLE DOWN TO ITS RIVETS AND WE SPED NORTHWARD BUT HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO NAVIGATE UNDER THE ICE BANK TO THE OPEN SEA ANOTHER DAY I WOULD BE DEAD FIRST
405-130894-0074 A FEW WHIFFS OF AIR HAD ENTERED MY LUNGS HAD WE RISEN TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES HAD WE CLEARED THE ICE BANK NO NED AND CONSEIL MY TWO GALLANT FRIENDS WERE SACRIFICING THEMSELVES TO SAVE ME
405-130894-0075 INSTEAD OF BREATHING IT THEMSELVES THEY HAD SAVED IT FOR ME AND WHILE THEY WERE SUFFOCATING THEY POURED LIFE INTO ME DROP BY DROP I TRIED TO PUSH THE DEVICE AWAY THEY HELD MY HANDS AND FOR A FEW MOMENTS I COULD BREATHE LUXURIOUSLY
405-130894-0077 HAD HE PERISHED HAD HIS COMPANIONS DIED WITH HIM
405-130894-0078 SEPARATING US FROM THE OPEN AIR WAS A MERE TRACT OF ICE COULD WE BREAK THROUGH IT
405-130895-0001 NEXT TO ME MY TWO COMPANIONS WERE GETTING TIPSY ON THE FRESH OXYGEN PARTICLES POOR SOULS WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM LONG STARVATION MUSTN'T POUNCE HEEDLESSLY ON THE FIRST FOOD GIVEN THEM WE ON THE OTHER HAND DIDN'T HAVE TO PRACTICE SUCH MODERATION
405-130895-0002 WE COULD SUCK THE ATOMS FROM THE AIR BY THE LUNGFUL AND IT WAS THE BREEZE THE BREEZE ITSELF THAT POURED INTO US THIS LUXURIOUS INTOXICATION AHHH CONSEIL WAS PUTTING IN
405-130895-0004 AND WHAT POWERFUL INHALATIONS THE CANADIAN DREW LIKE A FURNACE GOING FULL BLAST OUR STRENGTH RETURNED PROMPTLY AND WHEN I LOOKED AROUND I SAW THAT WE WERE ALONE ON THE PLATFORM NO CREWMEN
405-130895-0005 THOSE STRANGE SEAMEN ON THE NAUTILUS WERE CONTENT WITH THE OXYGEN CIRCULATING INSIDE NOT ONE OF THEM HAD COME UP TO ENJOY THE OPEN AIR THE FIRST WORDS I PRONOUNCED WERE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
405-130895-0007 GOOD LORD PROFESSOR NED LAND ANSWERED ME DON'T MENTION IT WHAT DID WE DO THAT'S SO PRAISEWORTHY NOT A THING IT WAS A QUESTION OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC YOUR LIFE IS WORTH MORE THAN OURS SO WE HAD TO SAVE IT
405-130895-0008 AND YOU MY GALLANT CONSEIL YOU SUFFERED A GREAT DEAL NOT TOO MUCH TO BE CANDID WITH MASTER I WAS LACKING A FEW THROATFULS OF AIR BUT I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN BY
405-130895-0010 WE'RE BOUND TO EACH OTHER FOREVER AND I'M DEEPLY INDEBTED TO YOU WHICH I'LL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CANADIAN SHOT BACK
405-130895-0011 CONSEIL PUT IN YES NED LAND WENT ON YOU CAN REPAY YOUR DEBT BY COMING WITH ME WHEN I LEAVE THIS INFERNAL NAUTILUS BY THE WAY CONSEIL SAID ARE WE GOING IN A FAVORABLE DIRECTION
405-130895-0013 BUT IF WE RETURNED TO THE PACIFIC FAR FROM EVERY POPULATED SHORE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO NED LAND'S PLANS WE WOULD SOON SETTLE THIS IMPORTANT POINT THE NAUTILUS TRAVELED SWIFTLY
405-130895-0014 SOON WE HAD CLEARED THE ANTARCTIC CIRCLE PLUS THE PROMONTORY OF CAPE HORN
405-130895-0016 NOW THEN THAT EVENING IT BECAME OBVIOUS MUCH TO MY SATISFACTION THAT WE WERE RETURNING NORTH BY THE ATLANTIC ROUTE I SHARED THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS WITH THE CANADIAN AND CONSEIL
405-130895-0017 THAT'S GOOD NEWS THE CANADIAN REPLIED BUT WHERE'S THE NAUTILUS GOING I'M UNABLE TO SAY NED AFTER THE SOUTH POLE
405-130895-0019 WHEN THE NAUTILUS ROSE TO THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES A FEW MINUTES BEFORE NOON WE RAISED LAND TO THE WEST
405-130895-0020 THE LAND OF FIRE A NAME GIVEN IT BY EARLY NAVIGATORS AFTER THEY SAW NUMEROUS CURLS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE NATIVES HUTS THIS LAND OF FIRE FORMS A HUGE CLUSTER OF ISLANDS OVER THIRTY LEAGUES LONG AND EIGHTY LEAGUES WIDE
405-130895-0022 A PYRAMID SHAPED BLOCK OF SHALE WITH A VERY SHARP SUMMIT WHICH DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT'S CLEAR OR VEILED IN VAPOR PREDICTS FAIR WEATHER OR FOUL AS NED LAND TOLD ME A FIRST CLASS BAROMETER MY FRIEND
405-130895-0023 YES SIR A NATURAL BAROMETER THAT DIDN'T LET ME DOWN WHEN I NAVIGATED THE NARROWS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN JUST THEN ITS PEAK APPEARED BEFORE US STANDING OUT DISTINCTLY AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE SKIES THIS FORECAST FAIR WEATHER
405-130895-0025 IT SERVED AS BOTH NEST AND NOURISHMENT FOR MYRIADS OF CRUSTACEANS AND MOLLUSKS FOR CRABS AND CUTTLEFISH HERE SEALS AND OTTERS COULD INDULGE IN A SUMPTUOUS MEAL MIXING MEAT FROM FISH
405-130895-0026 WITH VEGETABLES FROM THE SEA LIKE THE ENGLISH WITH THEIR IRISH STEWS THE NAUTILUS PASSED OVER THESE LUSH LUXURIANT DEPTHS WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
405-130895-0028 AS FOR FISH I SPECIFICALLY OBSERVED SOME BONY FISH BELONGING TO THE GOBY GENUS ESPECIALLY SOME GUDGEON TWO DECIMETERS LONG SPRINKLED WITH WHITISH AND YELLOW SPOTS
405-130895-0029 I LIKEWISE MARVELED AT THE NUMEROUS MEDUSAS INCLUDING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF THEIR BREED THE COMPASS JELLYFISH UNIQUE TO THE FALKLAND SEAS
405-130895-0031 UPSIDE DOWN BASKETS FROM WHICH WIDE LEAVES AND LONG RED TWIGS WERE GRACEFULLY TRAILING THEY SWAM WITH QUIVERINGS OF THEIR FOUR LEAFLIKE ARMS LETTING THE OPULENT TRESSES OF THEIR TENTACLES DANGLE IN THE DRIFT
405-130895-0032 SHADOWS ILLUSIONS MELTING AND EVAPORATING OUTSIDE THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT WHEN THE LAST TIPS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS HAD DISAPPEARED BELOW THE HORIZON
405-130895-0034 DIDN'T PUT IN AN APPEARANCE
405-130895-0035 KEEPING TO ITS NORTHERLY HEADING IT FOLLOWED THE LONG WINDINGS OF SOUTH AMERICA BY THEN WE HAD FARED SIXTEEN THOUSAND LEAGUES SINCE COMING ON BOARD IN THE SEAS OF JAPAN
405-130895-0037 CAPTAIN NEMO HAD NO LIKING FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BRAZIL'S POPULOUS SHORES BECAUSE HE SHOT BY WITH DIZZYING SPEED
412-126975-0000 THE FLYING STARS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CRIME I EVER COMMITTED FLAMBEAU WOULD SAY IN HIS HIGHLY MORAL OLD AGE
412-126975-0002 I HAD ALWAYS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE CRIMES SUITABLE TO THE SPECIAL SEASON OR LANDSCAPES IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF CHOOSING THIS OR THAT TERRACE OR GARDEN FOR A CATASTROPHE AS IF FOR A STATUARY GROUP
412-126975-0003 THUS SQUIRES SHOULD BE SWINDLED IN LONG ROOMS PANELLED WITH OAK WHILE JEWS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD RATHER FIND THEMSELVES UNEXPECTEDLY PENNILESS
412-126975-0005 IF I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR IN THE GREEN LAWNS AND GREY TOWERS OF SOME CATHEDRAL TOWN SIMILARLY IN FRANCE WHEN I HAD GOT MONEY OUT OF A RICH AND WICKED PEASANT
412-126975-0006 WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT GRATIFIED ME TO GET HIS INDIGNANT HEAD RELIEVED AGAINST A GREY LINE OF CLIPPED POPLARS AND THOSE SOLEMN PLAINS OF GAUL OVER WHICH BROODS THE MIGHTY SPIRIT OF MILLET
412-126975-0008 I DID IT IN A GOOD OLD MIDDLE CLASS HOUSE NEAR PUTNEY A HOUSE WITH A CRESCENT OF CARRIAGE DRIVE A HOUSE WITH A STABLE BY THE SIDE OF IT A HOUSE WITH THE NAME ON THE TWO OUTER GATES
412-126975-0009 A HOUSE WITH A MONKEY TREE ENOUGH YOU KNOW THE SPECIES I REALLY THINK MY IMITATION OF DICKENS'S STYLE WAS DEXTEROUS AND LITERARY IT SEEMS ALMOST A PITY
412-126975-0011 IT WAS PERFECTLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND IT IS FROM THE OUTSIDE THAT THE STRANGER MUST STUDY IT FROM THIS STANDPOINT THE DRAMA MAY BE SAID TO HAVE BEGUN WHEN THE FRONT DOORS OF THE HOUSE WITH THE STABLE
412-126975-0012 OPENED ON THE GARDEN WITH THE MONKEY TREE AND A YOUNG GIRL CAME OUT WITH BREAD TO FEED THE BIRDS ON THE AFTERNOON OF BOXING DAY SHE HAD A PRETTY FACE WITH BRAVE BROWN EYES
412-126975-0014 THE WINTER AFTERNOON WAS REDDENING TOWARDS EVENING AND ALREADY A RUBY LIGHT WAS ROLLED OVER THE BLOOMLESS BEDS FILLING THEM AS IT WERE WITH THE GHOSTS OF THE DEAD ROSES
412-126975-0015 ON ONE SIDE OF THE HOUSE STOOD THE STABLE ON THE OTHER AN ALLEY OR CLOISTER OF LAURELS LED TO THE LARGER GARDEN BEHIND THE YOUNG LADY HAVING SCATTERED BREAD FOR THE BIRDS
412-126975-0017 HERE SHE GAVE AN EXCLAMATION OF WONDER REAL OR RITUAL AND LOOKING UP AT THE HIGH GARDEN WALL ABOVE HER BEHELD IT FANTASTICALLY BESTRIDDEN BY A SOMEWHAT FANTASTIC FIGURE
412-126975-0018 OH DON'T JUMP MISTER CROOK SHE CALLED OUT IN SOME ALARM IT'S MUCH TOO HIGH THE INDIVIDUAL RIDING THE PARTY WALL LIKE AN AERIAL HORSE
412-126975-0020 THIS SHOWED THE MORE PLAINLY BECAUSE HE WORE AN AGGRESSIVE RED TIE THE ONLY PART OF HIS COSTUME OF WHICH HE SEEMED TO TAKE ANY CARE PERHAPS IT WAS A SYMBOL
412-126975-0021 HE TOOK NO NOTICE OF THE GIRL'S ALARMED ADJURATION BUT LEAPT LIKE A GRASSHOPPER TO THE GROUND BESIDE HER WHERE HE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE BROKEN HIS LEGS I THINK I WAS MEANT TO BE A BURGLAR
412-126975-0023 HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH THINGS SHE REMONSTRATED WELL SAID THE YOUNG MAN IF YOU'RE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WALL I CAN'T SEE THAT IT'S WRONG TO CLIMB OVER IT
412-126975-0024 I NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU WILL SAY OR DO NEXT SHE SAID I DON'T OFTEN KNOW MYSELF REPLIED MISTER CROOK BUT THEN I AM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE WALL NOW
412-126975-0026 AS THEY WENT TOGETHER THROUGH THE LAURELS TOWARDS THE FRONT GARDEN A MOTOR HORN SOUNDED THRICE COMING NEARER AND NEARER AND A CAR OF SPLENDID SPEED GREAT ELEGANCE
412-126975-0027 AND STOOD THROBBING HULLO HULLO SAID THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE RED TIE HERE'S SOMEBODY BORN ON THE RIGHT SIDE ANYHOW I DIDN'T KNOW MISS ADAMS THAT YOUR SANTA CLAUS WAS SO MODERN AS THIS
412-126975-0029 RUBY ADAMS ADDED HE IS VERY KIND JOHN CROOK JOURNALIST HAD HEARD OF THAT EMINENT CITY MAGNATE AND IT WAS NOT HIS FAULT IF THE CITY MAGNATE
412-126975-0030 HAD NOT HEARD OF HIM FOR IN CERTAIN ARTICLES IN THE CLARION OR THE NEW AGE SIR LEOPOLD HAD BEEN DEALT WITH AUSTERELY BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND GRIMLY WATCHED THE UNLOADING OF THE MOTOR CAR
412-126975-0032 AND BEGAN TO UNPACK HIM LIKE SOME VERY CAREFULLY PROTECTED PARCEL RUGS ENOUGH TO STOCK A BAZAAR FURS OF ALL THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST AND SCARVES OF ALL THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
412-126975-0033 WERE UNWRAPPED ONE BY ONE TILL THEY REVEALED SOMETHING RESEMBLING THE HUMAN FORM THE FORM OF A FRIENDLY BUT FOREIGN LOOKING OLD GENTLEMAN WITH A GREY GOAT LIKE BEARD AND A BEAMING SMILE
412-126975-0035 HAD COME OUT HIMSELF TO INVITE HIS EMINENT GUEST INSIDE HE WAS A TALL SUNBURNT AND VERY SILENT MAN WHO WORE A RED SMOKING CAP LIKE A FEZ MAKING HIM LOOK LIKE ONE OF THE ENGLISH SIRDARS
412-126975-0036 OR PASHAS IN EGYPT WITH HIM WAS HIS BROTHER IN LAW LATELY COME FROM CANADA A BIG AND RATHER BOISTEROUS YOUNG GENTLEMAN FARMER WITH A YELLOW BEARD BY NAME JAMES BLOUNT
412-126975-0038 EVERYTHING SEEMED UNDISTINGUISHED ABOUT THE PRIEST EVEN DOWN TO HIS NAME WHICH WAS BROWN YET THE COLONEL HAD ALWAYS FOUND SOMETHING COMPANIONABLE ABOUT HIM AND FREQUENTLY ASKED HIM TO SUCH FAMILY GATHERINGS
412-126975-0039 IN THE LARGE ENTRANCE HALL OF THE HOUSE THERE WAS AMPLE ROOM EVEN FOR SIR LEOPOLD AND THE REMOVAL OF HIS WRAPS PORCH AND VESTIBULE INDEED
412-126975-0041 OVER WHICH HUNG THE COLONEL'S SWORD THE PROCESS WAS COMPLETED AND THE COMPANY INCLUDING THE SATURNINE CROOK PRESENTED TO SIR LEOPOLD FISCHER THAT VENERABLE FINANCIER HOWEVER
412-126975-0042 STILL SEEMED STRUGGLING WITH PORTIONS OF HIS WELL LINED ATTIRE AND AT LENGTH PRODUCED FROM A VERY INTERIOR TAIL COAT POCKET A BLACK OVAL CASE WHICH HE RADIANTLY EXPLAINED TO BE HIS CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR HIS GOD DAUGHTER
412-126975-0044 IT WAS JUST AS IF A CRYSTAL FOUNTAIN HAD SPURTED IN THEIR EYES IN A NEST OF ORANGE VELVET LAY LIKE THREE EGGS THREE WHITE AND VIVID DIAMONDS THAT SEEMED TO SET THE VERY AIR ON FIRE ALL ROUND THEM
412-126975-0045 FISCHER STOOD BEAMING BENEVOLENTLY AND DRINKING DEEP OF THE ASTONISHMENT AND ECSTASY OF THE GIRL THE GRIM ADMIRATION AND GRUFF THANKS OF THE COLONEL THE WONDER OF THE WHOLE GROUP
412-126975-0047 BUT EVEN THE ROUGH MEN ABOUT IN THE STREETS AND HOTELS COULD HARDLY HAVE KEPT THEIR HANDS OFF THEM I MIGHT HAVE LOST THEM ON THE ROAD HERE IT WAS QUITE POSSIBLE QUITE NATURAL I SHOULD SAY
412-126975-0048 GROWLED THE MAN IN THE RED TIE I SHOULDN'T BLAME EM IF THEY HAD TAKEN EM WHEN THEY ASK FOR BREAD AND YOU DON'T EVEN GIVE THEM A STONE I THINK THEY MIGHT TAKE THE STONE FOR THEMSELVES
412-126975-0050 A SAINT SAID FATHER BROWN I THINK SAID SIR LEOPOLD WITH A SUPERCILIOUS SMILE THAT RUBY MEANS A SOCIALIST
412-126975-0051 A RADICAL DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO LIVES ON RADISHES REMARKED CROOK WITH SOME IMPATIENCE AND A CONSERVATIVE DOES NOT MEAN A MAN WHO PRESERVES JAM NEITHER I ASSURE YOU
412-126975-0053 PUT IN THE PRIEST IN A LOW VOICE TO OWN YOUR OWN SOOT CROOK LOOKED AT HIM WITH AN EYE OF INTEREST AND EVEN RESPECT DOES ONE WANT TO OWN SOOT HE ASKED ONE MIGHT
412-126975-0054 WITH SPECULATION IN HIS EYE I'VE HEARD THAT GARDENERS USE IT AND I ONCE MADE SIX CHILDREN HAPPY AT CHRISTMAS WHEN THE CONJUROR DIDN'T COME ENTIRELY WITH SOOT APPLIED EXTERNALLY
412-126975-0056 AND THE ASTONISHED FINANCIER HIS IN SOME CONSIDERABLE DEPRECATION WHEN A KNOCK SOUNDED AT THE DOUBLE FRONT DOORS THE PRIEST OPENED THEM AND THEY SHOWED AGAIN THE FRONT GARDEN OF EVERGREENS MONKEY TREE AND ALL
412-126975-0057 NOW GATHERING GLOOM AGAINST A GORGEOUS VIOLET SUNSET THE SCENE THUS FRAMED WAS SO COLOURED AND QUAINT LIKE A BACK SCENE IN A PLAY THAT THEY FORGOT A MOMENT THE INSIGNIFICANT FIGURE STANDING IN THE DOOR
412-126975-0059 MISTER BLOUNT STARTED AND STOPPED IN HIS SHOUT OF ASSENT RIPPING UP THE ENVELOPE WITH EVIDENT ASTONISHMENT HE READ IT HIS FACE CLOUDED A LITTLE AND THEN CLEARED AND HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER IN LAW AND HOST
412-126975-0060 I'M SICK AT BEING SUCH A NUISANCE COLONEL HE SAID WITH THE CHEERY COLONIAL CONVENTIONS BUT WOULD IT UPSET YOU IF AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE CALLED ON ME HERE TONIGHT ON BUSINESS IN POINT OF FACT IT'S FLORIAN
412-126975-0062 OF COURSE OF COURSE REPLIED THE COLONEL CARELESSLY MY DEAR CHAP ANY FRIEND OF YOURS NO DOUBT HE WILL PROVE AN ACQUISITION
412-126975-0063 HE'LL BLACK HIS FACE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED BLOUNT LAUGHING I DON'T DOUBT HE'D BLACK EVERYONE ELSE'S EYES I DON'T CARE I'M NOT REFINED
412-126975-0065 DON'T LET'S QUARREL THERE ARE LOWER JOKES THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT DISLIKE OF THE RED TIED YOUTH BORN OF HIS PREDATORY OPINIONS AND EVIDENT INTIMACY WITH THE PRETTY GODCHILD
412-126975-0066 LED FISCHER TO SAY IN HIS MOST SARCASTIC MAGISTERIAL MANNER NO DOUBT YOU HAVE FOUND SOMETHING MUCH LOWER THAN SITTING ON A TOP HAT WHAT IS IT PRAY
412-126975-0068 WHAT I SAY IS LET'S DO SOMETHING FOR THE COMPANY TONIGHT NOT BLACKING FACES OR SITTING ON HATS IF YOU DON'T LIKE THOSE BUT SOMETHING OF THE SORT WHY COULDN'T WE HAVE A PROPER OLD ENGLISH PANTOMIME
412-126975-0069 CLOWN COLUMBINE AND SO ON I SAW ONE WHEN I LEFT ENGLAND AT TWELVE YEARS OLD AND IT'S BLAZED IN MY BRAIN LIKE A BONFIRE EVER SINCE I CAME BACK TO THE OLD COUNTRY ONLY LAST YEAR
412-126975-0071 OR SOMETHING BLUE BEARD'S MORE IN MY LINE AND HIM I LIKE BEST WHEN HE TURNED INTO THE PANTALOON I'M ALL FOR MAKING A POLICEMAN INTO SAUSAGES SAID JOHN CROOK
412-126975-0072 IT'S A BETTER DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM THAN SOME RECENTLY GIVEN BUT SURELY THE GET UP WOULD BE TOO BIG A BUSINESS NOT A SCRAP CRIED BLOUNT QUITE CARRIED AWAY

426-122819-0000 THAT OLD NUISANCE OF A RACHEL LYNDE WAS HERE AGAIN TODAY PESTERING ME FOR A SUBSCRIPTION TOWARDS BUYING A CARPET FOR THE VESTRY ROOM SAID MISTER HARRISON WRATHFULLY I DETEST THAT WOMAN MORE THAN ANYBODY I KNOW SHE CAN PUT A WHOLE SERMON
426-122819-0001 TEXT COMMENT AND APPLICATION INTO SIX WORDS AND THROW IT AT YOU LIKE A BRICK ANNE WHO WAS PERCHED ON THE EDGE OF THE VERANDA ENJOYING THE CHARM OF A MILD WEST WIND BLOWING ACROSS A NEWLY PLOUGHED FIELD ON A GRAY NOVEMBER TWILIGHT
426-122819-0003 I DIDN'T LIKE MISSUS LYNDE AT FIRST EITHER BUT AS SOON AS I CAME TO UNDERSTAND HER I LEARNED TO MISSUS LYNDE MAY BE AN ACQUIRED TASTE WITH SOME FOLKS
426-122819-0004 I SAID SOME DREADFUL THINGS TO MISSUS LYNDE LONG AGO BUT IT WAS WHEN I HAD LOST MY TEMPER I COULDN'T SAY THEM DELIBERATELY IT WAS THE TRUTH AND I BELIEVE IN TELLING THE TRUTH TO EVERYBODY
426-122819-0006 I KNOW I HAVE RED HAIR TOO ALTHOUGH IT'S MUCH DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE SO THERE'S NO NEED OF TELLING ME THAT EITHER WELL WELL I'LL TRY AND NOT MENTION IT AGAIN SINCE YOU'RE SO SENSITIVE
426-122819-0007 YOU MUST EXCUSE ME ANNE I'VE GOT A HABIT OF BEING OUTSPOKEN AND FOLKS MUSTN'T MIND IT BUT THEY CAN'T HELP MINDING IT AND I DON'T THINK IT'S ANY HELP THAT IT'S YOUR HABIT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK OF A PERSON WHO WENT ABOUT STICKING PINS AND NEEDLES INTO PEOPLE AND SAYING
426-122819-0009 AND NEVER SAID A WORD WHEN TIMOTHY COTTON STOLE A CROCK OF BUTTER OUT OF HER DAIRY AND TOLD HIS WIFE HE'D BOUGHT IT FROM HER MISSUS COTTON CAST IT UP TO HER THE NEXT TIME THEY MET THAT IT TASTED OF TURNIPS AND MISSUS LYNDE JUST SAID SHE WAS SORRY IT HAD TURNED OUT SO POORLY
426-122819-0010 FOLKS ARE EVERLASTING BEGGING FOR MONEY HERE IT SEEMS TO ME HOW'S YOUR PROJECT OF PAINTING THE HALL COMING ON SPLENDIDLY WE HAD A MEETING OF THE A V I S LAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND FOUND THAT WE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY SUBSCRIBED TO PAINT THE HALL AND SHINGLE THE ROOF TOO
426-122819-0012 MISTER ROGER PYE IS GOING TO GET THE PAINT IN TOWN TODAY WHO'S GOT THE JOB MISTER JOSHUA PYE OF CARMODY HE HAS NEARLY FINISHED THE SHINGLING WE HAD TO GIVE HIM THE CONTRACT FOR EVERY ONE OF THE PYES AND THERE ARE FOUR FAMILIES YOU KNOW
426-122819-0013 SAID THEY WOULDN'T GIVE A CENT UNLESS JOSHUA GOT IT THEY HAD SUBSCRIBED TWELVE DOLLARS BETWEEN THEM AND WE THOUGHT THAT WAS TOO MUCH TO LOSE ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GIVEN IN TO THE PYES MISSUS LYNDE SAYS THEY TRY TO RUN EVERYTHING
426-122819-0015 HE'S PECULIAR ENOUGH ALL RIGHT THEN SAID MISTER HARRISON DRILY
426-122819-0016 I NEVER WAS MUCH OF A TALKER TILL I CAME TO AVONLEA AND THEN I HAD TO BEGIN IN SELF DEFENSE OR MISSUS LYNDE WOULD HAVE SAID I WAS DUMB AND STARTED A SUBSCRIPTION TO HAVE ME TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE
426-122819-0018 THE POOR BIRD HAS BEEN MOPING EVER SINCE THOSE CHILDREN MUST BE A SIGHT OF TROUBLE TO YOU FOLKS EVERYTHING THAT'S WORTH HAVING IS SOME TROUBLE SAID ANNE SECRETLY RESOLVING TO FORGIVE DAVY'S NEXT OFFENCE WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE SINCE HE HAD AVENGED HER ON GINGER
426-122819-0019 BEGAN PAINTING THE NEXT DAY HE WAS NOT DISTURBED IN HIS TASK THE HALL WAS SITUATED ON WHAT WAS CALLED THE LOWER ROAD IN LATE AUTUMN THIS ROAD WAS ALWAYS MUDDY AND WET AND PEOPLE GOING TO CARMODY TRAVELED BY THE LONGER UPPER ROAD
426-122819-0021 THE NEWS FLEW LIKE WILDFIRE GILBERT BLYTHE PORING OVER A TEXT BOOK AT HOME HEARD IT FROM HIS FATHER'S HIRED BOY AT SUNSET AND RUSHED BREATHLESSLY TO GREEN GABLES JOINED ON THE WAY BY FRED WRIGHT
426-122819-0022 ARRIVING AT THIS MOMENT WITH A BANDBOX HE HAD BROUGHT FROM TOWN FOR MARILLA HAVEN'T YOU HEARD SAID JANE WRATHFULLY WELL ITS SIMPLY THIS JOSHUA PYE HAS GONE AND PAINTED THE HALL BLUE INSTEAD OF GREEN A DEEP BRILLIANT BLUE
426-122819-0024 IT'S HEARTBREAKING AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE WE'VE HAD HOW ON EARTH COULD SUCH A MISTAKE HAVE HAPPENED WAILED DIANA THE BLAME OF THIS UNMERCIFUL DISASTER WAS EVENTUALLY NARROWED DOWN TO THE PYES THE IMPROVERS HAD DECIDED TO USE MORTON HARRIS PAINTS
426-122819-0025 AND THE MORTON HARRIS PAINT CANS WERE NUMBERED ACCORDING TO A COLOR CARD A PURCHASER CHOSE HIS SHADE ON THE CARD AND ORDERED BY THE ACCOMPANYING NUMBER
426-122819-0027 AND THERE THE MATTER STANDS TO THIS DAY THAT NIGHT THERE WAS BLANK DISMAY IN EVERY AVONLEA HOUSE WHERE AN IMPROVER LIVED THE GLOOM AT GREEN GABLES WAS SO INTENSE THAT IT QUENCHED EVEN DAVY ANNE WEPT AND WOULD NOT BE COMFORTED
426-122819-0028 AND IT SOUNDS THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR SOCIETY WE'LL SIMPLY BE LAUGHED OUT OF EXISTENCE IN LIFE AS IN DREAMS HOWEVER THINGS OFTEN GO BY CONTRARIES THE AVONLEA PEOPLE DID NOT LAUGH THEY WERE TOO ANGRY
426-122819-0030 AND AS FOR JOSHUA PYE HE MUST BE A BORN FOOL NOT TO SUSPECT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN HE OPENED THE CANS AND SAW THE COLOR OF THE PAINT JOSHUA PYE WHEN THUS ANIMADVERTED UPON RETORTED THAT THE AVONLEA TASTE IN COLORS WAS NO BUSINESS OF HIS
426-122819-0031 YOU CAN'T HOLD HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MISTAKE SINCE HE CLAIMS HE WAS NEVER TOLD WHAT THE COLOR WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BUT JUST GIVEN THE CANS AND TOLD TO GO AHEAD BUT IT'S A BURNING SHAME AND THAT HALL CERTAINLY DOES LOOK AWFUL
426-122819-0033 HAD BEEN BADLY USED MISSUS LYNDE TOLD THEM TO KEEP ON AND SHOW THE PYES THAT THERE REALLY WERE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO COULD DO THINGS WITHOUT MAKING A MUDDLE OF THEM MISTER MAJOR SPENCER SENT THEM WORD THAT HE WOULD CLEAN OUT ALL THE STUMPS ALONG THE ROAD FRONT OF HIS FARM AND SEED IT DOWN WITH GRASS AT HIS OWN EXPENSE
426-122819-0034 TO TELL HER THAT IF THE SASSIETY WANTED TO MAKE A GERANIUM BED AT THE CROSSROADS IN THE SPRING THEY NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF HER COW FOR SHE WOULD SEE THAT THE MARAUDING ANIMAL WAS KEPT WITHIN SAFE BOUNDS EVEN MISTER HARRISON CHUCKLED IF HE CHUCKLED AT ALL IN PRIVATE
426-122819-0036 FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO SIT IN THE HALL AFTER THIS WITHOUT BEING LEAKED ON YOU'VE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH ANYHOW
426-122821-0000 TEACHING IS REALLY VERY INTERESTING WORK WROTE ANNE TO A QUEEN'S ACADEMY CHUM JANE SAYS SHE THINKS IT IS MONOTONOUS BUT I DON'T FIND IT SO SOMETHING FUNNY IS ALMOST SURE TO HAPPEN EVERY DAY AND THE CHILDREN SAY SUCH AMUSING THINGS
426-122821-0002 BECAUSE IT WOULD RAIN THE NEXT DAY IT'S SO HARD NOT TO LAUGH STELLA I HAVE TO SAVE UP ALL MY AMUSEMENT UNTIL I GET HOME AND MARILLA SAYS IT MAKES HER NERVOUS TO HEAR WILD SHRIEKS OF MIRTH PROCEEDING FROM THE EAST GABLE WITHOUT ANY APPARENT CAUSE

426-122821-0005 BUT IF YOU WERE A WIDOW THERE'D BE NO DANGER OF EITHER THE MOST REMARKABLE WISH WAS SALLY BELL'S SHE WANTED A HONEYMOON
426-122821-0006 BECAUSE HER COUSIN IN MONTREAL WENT ON A HONEYMOON WHEN HE WAS MARRIED AND HE HAD ALWAYS HAD THE VERY LATEST IN BICYCLES ANOTHER DAY I ASKED THEM ALL TO TELL ME THE NAUGHTIEST THING THEY HAD EVER DONE I COULDN'T GET THE OLDER ONES TO DO SO BUT THE THIRD CLASS ANSWERED QUITE FREELY

426-122822-0008 ANNE HAD WARNED THEM THAT IF THEY BROUGHT ANY MORE CAKES TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD BE CONFISCATED AND YET HERE WAS SAINT CLAIR DONNELL COOLLY PASSING A PARCEL OF THEM WRAPPED UP IN THE BLUE AND WHITE STRIPED PAPER MISSUS HIRAM USED UNDER HER VERY EYES

426-122822-0011 ANNE RECOVERING HERSELF SPRANG TO OPEN DOORS AND WINDOWS AND LET OUT THE GAS AND SMOKE WHICH FILLED THE ROOM THEN SHE HELPED THE GIRLS CARRY THE UNCONSCIOUS PRILLIE INTO THE PORCH

426-122822-0014 CHESTER SLOANE SPELLING ODORIFEROUS WITH TWO F'S WAS MADE TO FEEL THAT HE COULD NEVER LIVE DOWN THE DISGRACE OF IT EITHER IN THIS WORLD OR THAT WHICH IS TO COME
426-122822-0016 HE PEERED ACROSS HIS BOOK AT ANNE HIS BLACK EYES SPARKLING WITH CURIOSITY AND MOCKERY ANNE TWITCHED OPEN THE DRAWER OF HER DESK IN SEARCH OF CHALK AND UNDER HER VERY HAND A LIVELY MOUSE SPRANG OUT OF THE DRAWER SCAMPERED OVER THE DESK AND LEAPED TO THE FLOOR
426-122822-0017 ESPECIALLY AS SHE DIDN'T KNOW JUST WHERE THE MOUSE HAD GONE BUT SHE DECIDED NOT TO WHO COULD TAKE ANY COMFORT OUT OF HYSTERICS WITH A TEACHER SO WHITE FACED AND SO BLAZING EYED STANDING BEFORE ONE WHO PUT THAT MOUSE IN MY DESK SAID ANNE
426-122822-0019 ANNE PAID NO ATTENTION TO THE WRETCHED JOSEPH SHE LOOKED AT ANTHONY PYE AND ANTHONY PYE LOOKED BACK UNABASHED AND UNASHAMED ANTHONY WAS IT YOU YES IT WAS SAID ANTHONY INSOLENTLY
426-122822-0020 ANNE TOOK HER POINTER FROM HER DESK IT WAS A LONG HEAVY HARDWOOD POINTER COME HERE ANTHONY IT WAS FAR FROM BEING THE MOST SEVERE PUNISHMENT ANTHONY PYE HAD EVER UNDERGONE ANNE
426-122822-0022 SHE SAT DOWN AT HER DESK FEELING ASHAMED REPENTANT AND BITTERLY MORTIFIED HER QUICK ANGER WAS GONE AND SHE WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEEK RELIEF IN TEARS SO ALL HER BOASTS HAD COME TO THIS SHE HAD ACTUALLY WHIPPED ONE OF HER PUPILS
426-122822-0023 KEPT BACK HER TEARS UNTIL SHE GOT HOME THAT NIGHT THEN SHE SHUT HERSELF IN THE EAST GABLE ROOM AND WEPT ALL HER SHAME AND REMORSE AND DISAPPOINTMENT INTO HER PILLOWS WEPT SO LONG THAT MARILLA GREW ALARMED INVADED THE ROOM AND INSISTED ON KNOWING WHAT THE TROUBLE WAS
426-122822-0025 IT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO OH NO NO MARILLA AND I DON'T SEE HOW I CAN EVER LOOK THOSE CHILDREN IN THE FACE AGAIN I FEEL THAT I HAVE HUMILIATED MYSELF TO THE VERY DUST YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CROSS AND HATEFUL AND HORRID I WAS
426-122822-0026 OH MARILLA I HAVE TRIED SO HARD TO BE PATIENT AND TO WIN ANTHONY'S LIKING AND NOW IT HAS ALL GONE FOR NOTHING MARILLA PASSED HER HARD WORK WORN HAND OVER THE GIRL'S GLOSSY TUMBLED HAIR WITH A WONDERFUL TENDERNESS

426-122822-0031 EVERY MORN IS THE WORLD MADE NEW SANG ANNE AS SHE DRESSED OWING TO THE SNOW SHE HAD TO GO AROUND BY THE ROAD TO SCHOOL AND SHE THOUGHT IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPISH COINCIDENCE THAT ANTHONY PYE SHOULD COME PLOUGHING ALONG JUST AS SHE LEFT THE GREEN GABLES LANE
426-122822-0032 ANNE SURRENDERED HER BOOKS AND WONDERED IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY BE AWAKE ANTHONY WALKED ON IN SILENCE TO THE SCHOOL BUT WHEN ANNE TOOK HER BOOKS SHE SMILED DOWN AT HIM NOT THE STEREOTYPED KIND SMILE SHE HAD SO PERSISTENTLY ASSUMED FOR HIS BENEFIT
426-122822-0034 MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE CAME UP THE NEXT SATURDAY AND CONFIRMED THIS WELL ANNE I GUESS YOU'VE WON OVER ANTHONY PYE THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS HE BELIEVES YOU ARE SOME GOOD AFTER ALL EVEN IF YOU ARE A GIRL SAYS THAT WHIPPING YOU GAVE HIM WAS JUST AS GOOD AS A MAN'S
426-122822-0035 NO BUT THE PYES ARE AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY KNOWN RULE THAT'S WHAT DECLARED MISSUS RACHEL WITH CONVICTION
441-128982-0001 THE CAPTAIN WHO HAD BARTHOLEMY AND THE OTHERS IN CHARGE DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN IMPORTANT CAPTURE HE HAD MADE HE SUPPOSED THAT THESE PIRATES WERE ORDINARY BUCCANEERS AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WAS HIS INTENTION TO KEEP THEM AS HIS OWN PRIVATE PRISONERS
441-128982-0002 FOR AS THEY WERE ALL VERY ABLE BODIED MEN THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY USEFUL ON A SHIP BUT WHEN HIS VESSEL WAS SAFELY MOORED AND IT BECAME KNOWN IN THE TOWN THAT HE HAD A COMPANY OF PIRATES ON BOARD
441-128982-0004 AND WHO OUGHT IMMEDIATELY TO BE DELIVERED UP TO THE CIVIL AUTHORITIES THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER MET WITH NO FAVOR FROM THE SPANISH CAPTAIN WHO HAD FOUND BARTHOLEMY A VERY QUIET MAN AND COULD SEE THAT HE WAS A VERY STRONG ONE
441-128982-0005 AND HE DID NOT AT ALL DESIRE TO GIVE UP SUCH A VALUABLE ADDITION TO HIS CREW BUT THE MERCHANT GREW VERY ANGRY FOR HE KNEW THAT BARTHOLEMY HAD INFLICTED GREAT INJURY ON SPANISH COMMERCE AND AS THE CAPTAIN WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM HE WENT TO THE GOVERNOR OF THE TOWN AND REPORTED THE CASE
441-128982-0007 BUT HE DID NOT LOSE HEART AND IMMEDIATELY SET TO WORK TO FREE HIMSELF FROM HIS IRONS WHICH WERE PROBABLY VERY CLUMSY AFFAIRS AT LAST CARING LITTLE HOW MUCH HE SCRATCHED AND TORE HIS SKIN
441-128982-0008 HE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING RID OF HIS FETTERS AND COULD MOVE ABOUT AS FREELY AS A TIGER IN A CAGE TO GET OUT OF THIS CAGE WAS BARTHOLEMY'S FIRST OBJECT IT WOULD BE COMPARATIVELY EASY BECAUSE IN THE COURSE OF TIME SOME ONE WOULD COME INTO THE HOLD
441-128982-0010 AND HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM WHICH SEEMS A STRANGE FAILING IN A HARDY SAILOR WITH SO MANY OTHER NAUTICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ROUGH HOLD WHERE HE WAS SHUT UP OUR PIRATE PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUS AND EARNEST
441-128982-0011 HE WAS SATISFIED THAT THIS UNWIELDY CONTRIVANCE WOULD SUPPORT HIM IN THE WATER AMONG OTHER THINGS HE HAD FOUND IN HIS RUMMAGINGS ABOUT THE HOLD WAS AN OLD KNIFE AND WITH THIS IN HIS HAND HE NOW SAT WAITING FOR A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO ATTACK HIS SENTINEL
441-128982-0013 THERE WAS A FIERCE STRUGGLE BUT THE PIRATE WAS QUICK AND POWERFUL AND THE SENTINEL WAS SOON DEAD THEN CARRYING HIS TWO JARS BARTHOLEMY CLIMBED SWIFTLY AND NOISELESSLY UP THE SHORT LADDER
441-128982-0014 FOR A MOMENT HE SANK BELOW THE SURFACE BUT THE TWO AIR TIGHT JARS QUICKLY ROSE AND BORE HIM UP WITH THEM THERE WAS A BUSTLE ON BOARD THE SHIP THERE WAS SOME RANDOM FIRING OF MUSKETS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPLASHING WHICH THE WATCH HAD HEARD
441-128982-0016 AND RAN AS FAST AS HE COULD INTO THE DARK WOODS BEYOND THE TOWN BARTHOLEMY WAS NOW GREATLY IN FEAR THAT WHEN HIS ESCAPE WAS DISCOVERED HE WOULD BE TRACKED BY BLOODHOUNDS
441-128982-0017 WHICH WAS WHAT HE WISHED TO DO IF THE HOUNDS SHOULD GET UPON HIS TRAIL HE WAS A LOST MAN THE DESPERATE PIRATE THEREFORE DETERMINED TO GIVE THE BLOODHOUNDS NO CHANCE TO FOLLOW HIM AND FOR THREE DAYS HE REMAINED IN A MARSHY FOREST IN THE DARK RECESSES OF WHICH HE COULD HIDE
441-128982-0019 AND SOMETIMES HE SAW AT NIGHT DISTANT TORCHES WHICH HE WAS SURE WERE CARRIED BY MEN WHO WERE HUNTING FOR HIM BUT AT LAST THE PURSUIT SEEMED TO BE GIVEN UP AND HEARING NO MORE DOGS AND SEEING NO MORE FLICKERING LIGHTS BARTHOLEMY LEFT THE MARSH AND SET OUT ON HIS LONG JOURNEY DOWN THE COAST
441-128982-0020 WHICH WAS FORTY LEAGUES AWAY BUT WHERE HE HAD REASON TO SUPPOSE HE WOULD FIND SOME FRIENDS WHEN HE CAME OUT FROM AMONG THE TREES HE MOUNTED A SMALL HILL AND LOOKED BACK UPON THE TOWN THE PUBLIC SQUARE WAS LIGHTED AND THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HE SAW THE GALLOWS WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR HIS EXECUTION
441-128982-0022 BUT AFTER A DIET OF ROOTS SHELLFISH MUST HAVE BEEN A VERY AGREEABLE CHANGE AND THEY GAVE HIM ALL THE STRENGTH AND VIGOR HE NEEDED VERY OFTEN HE FOUND STREAMS AND INLETS WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO FORD
441-128982-0023 WHEN HE HAD MADE FOR HIMSELF WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FREE PASSAGE HE WOULD DASH IN AND HURRY ACROSS AT OTHER TIMES GREAT FORESTS STRETCHED DOWN TO THE VERY COAST AND THROUGH THESE HE WAS OBLIGED TO MAKE HIS WAY
441-128982-0025 THE ANIMALS MIGHT HOWL AROUND HIM AND GLARE AT HIM WITH THEIR SHINING EYES AND THE ALLIGATORS MIGHT LASH THE WATER INTO FOAM WITH THEIR GREAT TAILS
441-128982-0026 THIS WAS A WIDE RIVER FLOWING THROUGH THE INLAND COUNTRY INTO THE SEA HE MADE HIS WAY UP THE SHORE OF THIS RIVER FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BUT IT GREW BUT LITTLE NARROWER AND HE COULD SEE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ACROSS HE COULD NOT SWIM
441-128982-0028 BUT A MAN IN HIS SITUATION WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO GIVE UP READILY
441-128982-0029 NOW A PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAPPENED TO HIM ALTHOUGH TO AN ORDINARY TRAVELLER IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A MATTER OF NO IMPORTANCE WHATEVER ON THE EDGE OF THE SHORE WHERE IT HAD FLOATED DOWN FROM SOME REGION HIGHER UP THE RIVER
441-128982-0031 AND WHO BEGAN TO RUB A CROW BAR ON A STONE IN ORDER TO REDUCE IT TO THE PROPER SIZE BARTHOLEMY CAREFULLY KNOCKED ALL THE NAILS OUT OF THE BOARD AND THEN FINDING A LARGE FLAT STONE HE RUBBED DOWN ONE OF THEM UNTIL HE HAD FORMED IT INTO THE SHAPE OF A RUDE KNIFE BLADE
441-128982-0032 WHICH HE MADE AS SHARP AS HE COULD THEN WITH THESE TOOLS HE UNDERTOOK THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RAFT WORKING AWAY LIKE A BEAVER AND USING THE SHARPENED NAILS INSTEAD OF HIS TEETH
441-128982-0034 GATHERING UP HIS LEGS SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF REACH OF THE ALLIGATORS AND WITH A LONG POLE PUSHED HIMSELF OFF FROM SHORE SOMETIMES PADDLING AND SOMETIMES PUSHING HIS POLE AGAINST THE BOTTOM HE AT LAST GOT ACROSS THE RIVER AND TOOK UP HIS JOURNEY UPON DRY LAND
441-128982-0035 EVEN IF HE COULD NOT WALK NO ATHLETE OF THE PRESENT DAY NO MATTER IF HE SHOULD BE A MOST ACCOMPLISHED CIRCUS MAN COULD REASONABLY EXPECT TO PERFORM THE FEAT WHICH THIS BOLD PIRATE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISHED FOR FIVE OR SIX LEAGUES HE WENT THROUGH THAT MANGROVE FOREST
441-128988-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN A RESURRECTED PIRATE
441-128988-0001 THAT HE HAD COME BACK A COMPARATIVE PAUPER SURPRISED NO ONE FOR THIS WAS A COMMON THING TO HAPPEN TO A PIRATE BUT THE WONDER WAS THAT HE GOT BACK AT ALL HE HAD NO MONEY BUT BY THE EXERCISE OF HIS CRAFTY ABILITIES
441-128988-0003 HE DID NOT GO OUT IN SEARCH OF SHIPS BUT DIRECTED HIS VESSEL TO A LITTLE VILLAGE CALLED DE LOS CAYOS ON THE COAST OF CUBA FOR HERE HE THOUGHT WAS A CHANCE FOR A GOOD AND EASY STROKE OF BUSINESS
441-128988-0004 SO THAT LARGE SHIPS COULD NOT APPROACH VERY NEAR AND THUS THE VILLAGERS WERE KEPT BUSY CARRYING GOODS AND SUPPLIES IN SMALL BOATS BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS FROM THE TOWN TO THE VESSELS AT ANCHOR
441-128988-0006 HE CRUISED ABOUT THE COAST AT SOME DISTANCE FROM DE LOS CAYOS ENDEAVORING TO PROCURE TWO SMALL BOATS IN WHICH TO APPROACH THE TOWN BUT ALTHOUGH HIS PREPARATIONS WERE MADE AS QUIETLY AS POSSIBLE THE PRESENCE OF HIS VESSEL WAS DISCOVERED BY SOME FISHERMEN
441-128988-0007 INFORMING THE GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND THAT THE CRUEL PIRATE L'OLONNOIS WAS IN A SHIP A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THEIR VILLAGE WHICH HE UNDOUBTEDLY INTENDED TO ATTACK WHEN THE GOVERNOR HEARD THIS ASTONISHING TALE
441-128988-0009 AND WAS ABOUT TO FALL UPON A PEACEFUL LITTLE VILLAGE ON THE ISLAND OVER WHICH HE RULED FILLED THE GOVERNOR WITH RAGE AS WELL AS AMAZEMENT AND HE ORDERED A WELL ARMED SHIP WITH A LARGE CREW OF FIGHTING MEN TO SAIL IMMEDIATELY FOR DE LOS CAYOS
441-128988-0010 BY THE TIME THE WAR VESSEL HAD ARRIVED AT DE LOS CAYOS L'OLONNOIS HAD MADE HIS PREPARATION TO ATTACK THE PLACE HE HAD PROCURED TWO LARGE CANOES AND IN THESE HE HAD INTENDED TO ROW UP TO THE TOWN AND LAND WITH HIS MEN
441-128988-0012 WITH CANNON AND A WELL ARMED CREW WOULD HAVE ALTERED HIS PLANS SO COMPLETELY THAT HE WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT PART OF THE COAST OF CUBA WITH ALL POSSIBLE EXPEDITION BUT THE PIRATES OF THAT DAY SEEMED TO PAY VERY LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE ELEMENT OF ODDS
441-128988-0013 IF THEY MET AN ENEMY WHO WAS WEAK THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM AND IF THEY MET WITH ONE WHO WAS A GOOD DEAL STRONGER THAN THEMSELVES THEY WOULD FALL UPON HIM ALL THE SAME WHEN THE TIME CAME TO FIGHT THEY FOUGHT
441-128988-0015 AND HE ALSO NEEDED A LARGER FORCE THAN HE HAD WITH HIM AND HE THEREFORE CAPTURED SOME MEN WHO WERE FISHING ALONG THE COAST AND PUT THEM INTO HIS CANOES TO HELP WORK THE OARS THEN BY NIGHT HE PROCEEDED SLOWLY IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SPANISH VESSEL
441-128988-0016 THE MAN OF WAR WAS ANCHORED NOT VERY FAR FROM THE TOWN AND WHEN ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE WATCH ON DECK SAW SOME CANOES APPROACHING THEY SUPPOSED THEM TO BE BOATS FROM SHORE
441-128988-0018 BUT THEIR WAY WAS A VERY DIFFERENT ONE FROM ANY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BY THE CAPTAIN OF THE SHIP THEY ROWED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE TOWN AND WAITED UNTIL NEARLY DAYBREAK THEN THEY BOLDLY MADE FOR THE MAN OF WAR
441-128988-0019 ONE CANOE ATTACKING HER ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER ON THE OTHER BEFORE THE SPANISH COULD COMPREHEND WHAT HAD HAPPENED THERE WERE MORE THAN TWENTY PIRATES UPON THEIR DECKS THE DREADED L'OLONNOIS AT THEIR HEAD
441-128988-0021 L'OLONNOIS NOW STOOD A PROUD VICTOR ON THE DECK OF HIS PRIZE AND BEING A MAN OF PRINCIPLE HE DETERMINED TO LIVE UP TO THE DISTINGUISHED REPUTATION WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD
441-128988-0022 BARING HIS MUSCULAR AND HAIRY RIGHT ARM HE CLUTCHED THE HANDLE OF HIS SHARP AND HEAVY CUTLASS AND ORDERED THE PRISONERS TO BE BROUGHT UP FROM BELOW ONE AT A TIME AND CONDUCTED TO THE PLACE WHERE HE STOOD
441-128988-0024 THIS MAN WHO WAS NOT A SOLDIER WAS DESPERATELY FRIGHTENED AND BEGGED PITEOUSLY FOR HIS LIFE L'OLONNOIS FINDING THAT THE MAN WAS WILLING TO TELL EVERYTHING HE KNEW QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT THE SENDING OF THIS VESSEL FROM HAVANA
441-128988-0025 AND WHEN THE POOR FELLOW HAD FINISHED BY TELLING THAT HE HAD COME THERE NOT OF HIS OWN ACCORD BUT SIMPLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBEYING HIS MASTER TO HANG ALL THE PIRATES EXCEPT THEIR LEADER THAT GREAT BUCCANEER LAUGHED AND FINDING HE COULD GET NOTHING MORE FROM THE NEGRO
441-128988-0027 WHO HAD BEEN PRESERVED FROM THE FATE OF THE OTHERS BECAUSE L'OLONNOIS HAD SOME CORRESPONDENCE TO ATTEND TO AND HE NEEDED A MESSENGER TO CARRY A LETTER THE PIRATE CAPTAIN WENT INTO THE CABIN WHERE HE FOUND WRITING MATERIALS READY TO HIS HAND
441-128988-0028 AND THERE HE COMPOSED A LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR OF HAVANA A PART OF WHICH READ AS FOLLOWS I SHALL NEVER HENCEFORWARD GIVE QUARTER UNTO ANY SPANIARD WHATSOEVER
441-128988-0030 AND TO BE AFTERWARDS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SUCH UNHEARD OF INSOLENCE AND ABUSE WAS MORE THAN HE COULD BEAR AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MANY OF HIS OFFICIALS AND ATTENDANTS HE SWORE A TERRIBLE OATH THAT AFTER THAT HOUR HE WOULD NEVER AGAIN GIVE QUARTER TO ANY BUCCANEER
441-128988-0031 BUT WHEN THE INHABITANTS OF HAVANA AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES HEARD OF THIS TERRIBLE RESOLUTION OF THEIR GOVERNOR THEY WERE VERY MUCH DISTURBED THEY LIVED IN CONSTANT DANGER OF ATTACK ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO WERE ENGAGED IN FISHING OR MARITIME PURSUITS
441-128988-0033 CONSEQUENTLY IT WAS REPRESENTED TO THE GOVERNOR THAT HIS PLAN OF VENGEANCE WOULD WORK MOST DISASTROUSLY FOR THE SPANISH SETTLERS FOR THE BUCCANEERS COULD DO FAR MORE DAMAGE TO THEM THAN HE COULD POSSIBLY DO TO THESE DREADFUL BRETHREN OF THE COAST
441-128988-0034 AND THAT UNLESS HE WISHED TO BRING UPON THEM TROUBLES GREATER THAN THOSE OF FAMINE OR PESTILENCE THEY BEGGED THAT HE WOULD RETRACT HIS OATH WHEN THE HIGH DIGNITARY HAD COOLED DOWN A LITTLE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF SENSE IN WHAT THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE HAD SAID TO HIM
441-130108-0000 A SPUTTERING OF MUSKETRY WAS ALWAYS TO BE HEARD LATER THE CANNON HAD ENTERED THE DISPUTE IN THE FOG FILLED AIR THEIR VOICES MADE A THUDDING SOUND THE REVERBERATIONS WERE CONTINUAL
441-130108-0001 THIS PART OF THE WORLD LED A STRANGE BATTLEFUL EXISTENCE THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT WAS MARCHED TO RELIEVE A COMMAND THAT HAD LAIN LONG IN SOME DAMP TRENCHES THE MEN TOOK POSITIONS BEHIND A CURVING LINE OF RIFLE PITS THAT HAD BEEN TURNED UP LIKE A LARGE FURROW
441-130108-0003 ALWAYS THE NOISE OF SKIRMISHERS CAME FROM THE WOODS ON THE FRONT AND LEFT AND THE DIN ON THE RIGHT HAD GROWN TO FRIGHTFUL PROPORTIONS THE GUNS WERE ROARING WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S PAUSE FOR BREATH
441-130108-0004 IT SEEMED THAT THE CANNON HAD COME FROM ALL PARTS AND WERE ENGAGED IN A STUPENDOUS WRANGLE IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE HEARD THE YOUTH WISHED TO LAUNCH A JOKE A QUOTATION FROM NEWSPAPERS HE DESIRED TO SAY
441-130108-0006 LIKE BIRDS BUT THEY WERE NOW FOR THE MOST PART BLACK CREATURES WHO FLAPPED THEIR WINGS DREARILY NEAR TO THE GROUND AND REFUSED TO RISE ON ANY WINGS OF HOPE THE MEN'S FACES GREW DOLEFUL FROM THE INTERPRETING OF OMENS
441-130108-0007 STORIES OF DISASTER WERE BORNE INTO THEIR MINDS WITH MANY PROOFS THIS DIN OF MUSKETRY ON THE RIGHT GROWING LIKE A RELEASED GENIE OF SOUND EXPRESSED AND EMPHASIZED THE ARMY'S PLIGHT THE MEN WERE DISHEARTENED AND BEGAN TO MUTTER
441-130108-0009 THE DISORDERED HURRYING LINES OF THE ENEMY COULD SOMETIMES BE SEEN DOWN THROUGH THE GROVES AND LITTLE FIELDS THEY WERE YELLING SHRILL AND EXULTANT AT THIS SIGHT THE YOUTH FORGOT MANY PERSONAL MATTERS AND BECAME GREATLY ENRAGED HE EXPLODED IN LOUD SENTENCES
441-130108-0010 OBSERVED A MAN HIS FRIEND RECENTLY AROUSED WAS STILL VERY DROWSY HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM UNTIL HIS MIND TOOK IN THE MEANING OF THE MOVEMENT THEN HE SIGHED OH WELL I S'POSE WE GOT LICKED
441-130108-0012 HE PRESENTLY BEGAN A LONG AND INTRICATE DENUNCIATION OF THE COMMANDER OF THE FORCES MEBBE IT WA'N'T ALL HIS FAULT NOT ALL TOGETHER
441-130108-0013 IT'S OUR LUCK T GIT LICKED OFTEN SAID HIS FRIEND IN A WEARY TONE HE WAS TRUDGING ALONG WITH STOOPED SHOULDERS AND SHIFTING EYES LIKE A MAN WHO HAS BEEN CANED AND KICKED WELL DON'T WE FIGHT LIKE THE DEVIL
441-130108-0015 BUT NO ONE QUESTIONED HIS RIGHT TO DEAL IN SUCH WORDS AND PRESENTLY HE RECOVERED HIS AIR OF COURAGE HE WENT ON TO REPEAT A STATEMENT HE HAD HEARD GOING FROM GROUP TO GROUP AT THE CAMP THAT MORNING THE BRIGADIER SAID HE NEVER SAW A NEW REG'MENT FIGHT THE WAY WE FOUGHT YESTIRDAY DIDN'T HE
441-130108-0016 IN HIS REPLY THE FRIEND'S VOICE WAS STERN A COURSE NOT HE SAID
441-130108-0018 AND I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN FIGHTING AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING YET ALWAYS LOSING THROUGH SOME DERNED OLD LUNKHEAD OF A GENERAL
441-130108-0019 THE SPEECH PIERCED THE YOUTH INWARDLY HE WAS REDUCED TO AN ABJECT PULP BY THESE CHANCE WORDS HIS LEGS QUAKED PRIVATELY HE CAST A FRIGHTENED GLANCE AT THE SARCASTIC MAN WHY NO HE HASTENED TO SAY IN A CONCILIATING VOICE
441-130108-0021 THE YOUTH NEVERTHELESS FELT A THREAT HIS MIND SHRANK FROM GOING NEAR TO THE DANGER AND THEREAFTER HE WAS SILENT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SARCASTIC MAN'S WORDS TOOK FROM HIM ALL LOUD MOODS THAT WOULD MAKE HIM APPEAR PROMINENT
441-130108-0022 HE BECAME SUDDENLY A MODEST PERSON THERE WAS LOW TONED TALK AMONG THE TROOPS THE OFFICERS WERE IMPATIENT AND SNAPPY THEIR COUNTENANCES CLOUDED WITH THE TALES OF MISFORTUNE
441-130108-0024 THE NOISE OF FIRING DOGGED THEIR FOOTSTEPS SOMETIMES IT SEEMED TO BE DRIVEN A LITTLE WAY BUT IT ALWAYS RETURNED AGAIN WITH INCREASED INSOLENCE THE MEN MUTTERED AND CURSED THROWING BLACK LOOKS IN ITS DIRECTION
441-130108-0025 IN A CLEAR SPACE THE TROOPS WERE AT LAST HALTED REGIMENTS AND BRIGADES BROKEN AND DETACHED THROUGH THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THICKETS GREW TOGETHER AGAIN AND LINES WERE FACED TOWARD THE PURSUING BARK OF THE ENEMY'S INFANTRY
441-130108-0027 SAID A MAN HERE WE ARE EVERYBODY FIGHTIN BLOOD AN DESTRUCTION
441-130108-0028 WHO WERE LYING DOWN BEHIND WHATEVER PROTECTION THEY HAD COLLECTED A BATTERY HAD TRUNDLED INTO POSITION IN THE REAR AND WAS THOUGHTFULLY SHELLING THE DISTANCE THE REGIMENT UNMOLESTED AS YET
441-130108-0030 NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE WE GO OR WHY WE GO WE JUST GET FIRED AROUND FROM PILLAR TO POST AND GET LICKED HERE AND GET LICKED THERE AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IT'S DONE FOR IT MAKES A MAN FEEL LIKE A DAMN KITTEN IN A BAG
441-130108-0031 NOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE ETERNAL THUNDERS WE WAS MARCHED INTO THESE WOODS FOR ANYHOW UNLESS IT WAS TO GIVE THE REBS A REGULAR POT SHOT AT US WE CAME IN HERE AND GOT OUR LEGS ALL TANGLED UP IN THESE CUSSED BRIERS
441-130108-0033 OH THE DEVIL IT WILL YOU ALWAYS TALK LIKE A DOG HANGED PARSON DON'T TELL ME I KNOW
441-130108-0034 AT THIS TIME THERE WAS AN INTERPOSITION BY THE SAVAGE MINDED LIEUTENANT WHO WAS OBLIGED TO VENT SOME OF HIS INWARD DISSATISFACTION UPON HIS MEN YOU BOYS SHUT RIGHT UP
441-130108-0036 LESS TALKIN AN MORE FIGHTIN IS WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU BOYS I NEVER SAW SECH GABBLING JACKASSES HE PAUSED READY TO POUNCE UPON ANY MAN WHO MIGHT HAVE THE TEMERITY TO REPLY
441-130108-0037 THE DAY HAD GROWN MORE WHITE UNTIL THE SUN SHED HIS FULL RADIANCE UPON THE THRONGED FOREST A SORT OF A GUST OF BATTLE CAME SWEEPING TOWARD THAT PART OF THE LINE WHERE LAY THE YOUTH'S REGIMENT THE FRONT SHIFTED A TRIFLE TO MEET IT SQUARELY
441-130108-0039 THERE WAS A MIGHTY SONG OF CLASHES AND CRASHES THAT WENT SWEEPING THROUGH THE WOODS THE GUNS IN THE REAR AROUSED AND ENRAGED BY SHELLS THAT HAD BEEN THROWN BURR LIKE AT THEM SUDDENLY INVOLVED THEMSELVES IN A HIDEOUS ALTERCATION WITH ANOTHER BAND OF GUNS
441-130108-0040 THE BATTLE ROAR SETTLED TO A ROLLING THUNDER WHICH WAS A SINGLE LONG EXPLOSION IN THE REGIMENT THERE WAS A PECULIAR KIND OF HESITATION DENOTED IN THE ATTITUDES OF THE MEN
445-123857-0000 SOME GLORY IN THEIR BIRTH SOME IN THEIR SKILL SOME IN THEIR WEALTH SOME IN THEIR BODY'S FORCE SOME IN THEIR GARMENTS THOUGH NEW FANGLED ILL
445-123857-0001 SOME IN THEIR HAWKS AND HOUNDS SOME IN THEIR HORSE AND EVERY HUMOUR HATH HIS ADJUNCT PLEASURE WHEREIN IT FINDS A JOY ABOVE THE REST BUT THESE PARTICULARS ARE NOT MY MEASURE
445-123857-0003 SINCE THAT MY LIFE ON THY REVOLT DOTH LIE
445-123857-0004 HAPPY TO HAVE THY LOVE HAPPY TO DIE
445-123857-0006 IN MANY'S LOOKS THE FALSE HEART'S HISTORY IS WRIT IN MOODS AND FROWNS AND WRINKLES STRANGE BUT HEAVEN IN THY CREATION DID DECREE THAT IN THY FACE SWEET LOVE SHOULD EVER DWELL
445-123857-0007 WHATE'ER THY THOUGHTS OR THY HEART'S WORKINGS BE
445-123857-0009 AND WILL DO NONE THAT DO NOT DO THE THING THEY MOST DO SHOW WHO MOVING OTHERS ARE THEMSELVES AS STONE
445-123857-0010 THEY RIGHTLY DO INHERIT HEAVEN'S GRACES AND HUSBAND NATURE'S RICHES FROM EXPENSE THEY ARE THE LORDS AND OWNERS OF THEIR FACES OTHERS BUT STEWARDS OF THEIR EXCELLENCE
445-123857-0012 OUTBRAVES HIS DIGNITY FOR SWEETEST THINGS TURN SOUREST BY THEIR DEEDS LILIES THAT FESTER SMELL FAR WORSE THAN WEEDS
445-123857-0013 WHICH LIKE A CANKER IN THE FRAGRANT ROSE DOTH SPOT THE BEAUTY OF THY BUDDING NAME
445-123857-0015 O WHAT A MANSION HAVE THOSE VICES GOT WHICH FOR THEIR HABITATION CHOSE OUT THEE WHERE BEAUTY'S VEIL DOTH COVER EVERY BLOT AND ALL THINGS TURNS TO FAIR THAT EYES CAN SEE
445-123857-0016 TAKE HEED DEAR HEART OF THIS LARGE PRIVILEGE
445-123857-0018 WHAT OLD DECEMBER'S BARENESS EVERYWHERE AND YET THIS TIME REMOVED WAS SUMMER'S TIME THE TEEMING AUTUMN BIG WITH RICH INCREASE BEARING THE WANTON BURDEN OF THE PRIME
445-123857-0019 LIKE WIDOW'D WOMBS AFTER THEIR LORDS DECEASE YET THIS ABUNDANT ISSUE SEEM'D TO ME BUT HOPE OF ORPHANS AND UNFATHER'D FRUIT FOR SUMMER AND HIS PLEASURES WAIT ON THEE
445-123857-0021 FROM YOU HAVE I BEEN ABSENT IN THE SPRING WHEN PROUD PIED APRIL DRESS'D IN ALL HIS TRIM HATH PUT A SPIRIT OF YOUTH IN EVERY THING
445-123857-0022 YET NOR THE LAYS OF BIRDS NOR THE SWEET SMELL OF DIFFERENT FLOWERS IN ODOUR AND IN HUE COULD MAKE ME ANY SUMMER'S STORY TELL OR FROM THEIR PROUD LAP PLUCK THEM WHERE THEY GREW
445-123857-0024 YET SEEM'D IT WINTER STILL AND YOU AWAY AS WITH YOUR SHADOW I WITH THESE DID PLAY
445-123857-0025 THE FORWARD VIOLET THUS DID I CHIDE SWEET THIEF WHENCE DIDST THOU STEAL THY SWEET THAT SMELLS IF NOT FROM MY LOVE'S BREATH
445-123857-0027 THE ROSES FEARFULLY ON THORNS DID STAND ONE BLUSHING SHAME ANOTHER WHITE DESPAIR A THIRD NOR RED NOR WHITE HAD STOL'N OF BOTH AND TO HIS ROBBERY HAD ANNEX'D THY BREATH
445-123857-0028 BUT FOR HIS THEFT IN PRIDE OF ALL HIS GROWTH A VENGEFUL CANKER EAT HIM UP TO DEATH
445-123857-0030 DARKENING THY POWER TO LEND BASE SUBJECTS LIGHT RETURN FORGETFUL MUSE AND STRAIGHT REDEEM IN GENTLE NUMBERS TIME SO IDLY SPENT
445-123857-0031 SING TO THE EAR THAT DOTH THY LAYS ESTEEM AND GIVES THY PEN BOTH SKILL AND ARGUMENT
445-123860-0000 TIS BETTER TO BE VILE THAN VILE ESTEEM'D WHEN NOT TO BE RECEIVES REPROACH OF BEING AND THE JUST PLEASURE LOST WHICH IS SO DEEM'D NOT BY OUR FEELING BUT BY OTHERS SEEING
445-123860-0001 FOR WHY SHOULD OTHERS FALSE ADULTERATE EYES GIVE SALUTATION TO MY SPORTIVE BLOOD OR ON MY FRAILTIES WHY ARE FRAILER SPIES WHICH IN THEIR WILLS COUNT BAD WHAT I THINK GOOD
445-123860-0003 BY THEIR RANK THOUGHTS MY DEEDS MUST NOT BE SHOWN UNLESS THIS GENERAL EVIL THEY MAINTAIN ALL MEN ARE BAD AND IN THEIR BADNESS REIGN
445-123860-0004 WHICH SHALL ABOVE THAT IDLE RANK REMAIN BEYOND ALL DATE EVEN TO ETERNITY OR AT THE LEAST SO LONG AS BRAIN AND HEART HAVE FACULTY BY NATURE TO SUBSIST
445-123860-0006 THEY ARE BUT DRESSINGS OF A FORMER SIGHT OUR DATES ARE BRIEF AND THEREFORE WE ADMIRE WHAT THOU DOST FOIST UPON US THAT IS OLD AND RATHER MAKE THEM BORN TO OUR DESIRE THAN THINK THAT WE BEFORE HAVE HEARD THEM TOLD
445-123860-0007 THY REGISTERS AND THEE I BOTH DEFY NOT WONDERING AT THE PRESENT NOR THE PAST FOR THY RECORDS AND WHAT WE SEE DOTH LIE
445-123860-0009 IT FEARS NOT POLICY THAT HERETIC WHICH WORKS ON LEASES OF SHORT NUMBER'D HOURS BUT ALL ALONE STANDS HUGELY POLITIC THAT IT NOR GROWS WITH HEAT NOR DROWNS WITH SHOWERS TO THIS I WITNESS CALL
445-123860-0010 THE FOOLS OF TIME WHICH DIE FOR GOODNESS WHO HAVE LIVED FOR CRIME
445-123860-0012 HAVE I NOT SEEN DWELLERS ON FORM AND FAVOUR LOSE ALL AND MORE BY PAYING TOO MUCH RENT FOR COMPOUND SWEET FORGOING SIMPLE SAVOUR PITIFUL THRIVERS IN THEIR GAZING SPENT NO

445-123860-0015 O THOU MY LOVELY BOY WHO IN THY POWER DOST HOLD TIME'S FICKLE GLASS HIS FICKLE HOUR WHO HAST BY WANING GROWN
445-123860-0016 IF NATURE SOVEREIGN MISTRESS OVER WRACK AS THOU GOEST ONWARDS STILL WILL PLUCK THEE BACK SHE KEEPS THEE TO THIS PURPOSE
445-123860-0018 SWEET BEAUTY HATH NO NAME NO HOLY BOWER BUT IS PROFAN'D IF NOT LIVES IN DISGRACE
445-123860-0019 AND THEY MOURNERS SEEM AT SUCH WHO NOT BORN FAIR NO BEAUTY LACK SLAND'RING CREATION WITH A FALSE ESTEEM YET SO THEY MOURN
445-123860-0021 MURDEROUS BLOODY FULL OF BLAME SAVAGE EXTREME RUDE CRUEL NOT TO TRUST ENJOY'D NO SOONER BUT DESPISED STRAIGHT PAST REASON HUNTED
445-123860-0022 AND NO SOONER HAD PAST REASON HATED AS A SWALLOW'D BAIT ON PURPOSE LAID TO MAKE THE TAKER MAD MAD IN PURSUIT AND IN POSSESSION SO HAD HAVING AND IN QUEST TO HAVE
445-123860-0024 IF SNOW BE WHITE WHY THEN HER BREASTS ARE DUN IF HAIRS BE WIRES BLACK WIRES GROW ON HER HEAD I HAVE SEEN ROSES DAMASK'D RED AND WHITE
445-123860-0025 BUT NO SUCH ROSES SEE I IN HER CHEEKS AND IN SOME PERFUMES IS THERE MORE DELIGHT THAN IN THE BREATH THAT FROM MY MISTRESS REEKS I LOVE TO HEAR HER SPEAK
446-123501-0000 CHAPTER THREE MY ADVENT ON MARS I OPENED MY EYES UPON A STRANGE AND WEIRD LANDSCAPE I KNEW THAT I WAS ON MARS NOT ONCE DID I QUESTION EITHER MY SANITY OR MY WAKEFULNESS
446-123501-0001 I WAS NOT ASLEEP NO NEED FOR PINCHING HERE MY INNER CONSCIOUSNESS TOLD ME AS PLAINLY THAT I WAS UPON MARS AS YOUR CONSCIOUS MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE UPON EARTH YOU DO NOT QUESTION THE FACT
446-123501-0003 THE IRREGULARITIES OF LOW HILLS IT WAS MIDDAY THE SUN WAS SHINING FULL UPON ME AND THE HEAT OF IT WAS RATHER INTENSE UPON MY NAKED BODY YET NO GREATER
446-123501-0004 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN TRUE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON AN ARIZONA DESERT HERE AND THERE WERE SLIGHT OUTCROPPINGS OF QUARTZ BEARING ROCK WHICH GLISTENED IN THE SUNLIGHT AND A LITTLE TO MY LEFT PERHAPS A HUNDRED YARDS APPEARED A LOW WALLED ENCLOSURE
446-123501-0006 FOR THE EFFORT WHICH ON EARTH WOULD HAVE BROUGHT ME STANDING UPRIGHT CARRIED ME INTO THE MARTIAN AIR TO THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT THREE YARDS I ALIGHTED SOFTLY UPON THE GROUND HOWEVER WITHOUT APPRECIABLE SHOCK OR JAR
446-123501-0007 NOW COMMENCED A SERIES OF EVOLUTIONS WHICH EVEN THEN SEEMED LUDICROUS IN THE EXTREME I FOUND THAT I MUST LEARN TO WALK ALL OVER AGAIN
446-123501-0009 MY ATTEMPTS TO WALK RESULTED IN A VARIETY OF HOPS WHICH TOOK ME CLEAR OF THE GROUND A COUPLE OF FEET AT EACH STEP AND LANDED ME SPRAWLING UPON MY FACE OR BACK
446-123501-0010 MY MUSCLES PERFECTLY ATTUNED AND ACCUSTOMED TO THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ON EARTH PLAYED THE MISCHIEF WITH ME IN ATTEMPTING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO COPE WITH THE LESSER GRAVITATION AND LOWER AIR PRESSURE ON MARS
446-123501-0012 IT HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN ME TO SEE THE ROOF OF THE ENCLOSURE WAS OF SOLID GLASS
446-123501-0013 AND BENEATH THIS WERE SEVERAL HUNDRED LARGE EGGS PERFECTLY ROUND AND SNOWY WHITE THE EGGS WERE NEARLY UNIFORM IN SIZE BEING ABOUT TWO AND ONE HALF FEET IN DIAMETER FIVE OR SIX HAD ALREADY HATCHED
446-123501-0015 AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED TWO LEGS AND TWO ARMS WITH AN INTERMEDIARY PAIR OF LIMBS WHICH COULD BE USED AT WILL EITHER AS ARMS OR LEGS THEIR EYES WERE SET AT THE EXTREME SIDES OF THEIR HEADS A TRIFLE ABOVE THE CENTER
446-123501-0016 WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF TURNING THE HEAD THE EARS WHICH WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE EYES AND CLOSER TOGETHER WERE SMALL CUP SHAPED ANTENNAE PROTRUDING NOT MORE THAN AN INCH ON THESE YOUNG SPECIMENS
446-123501-0018 THESE LATTER ADD A MOST FEROCIOUS APPEARANCE TO AN OTHERWISE FEARSOME AND TERRIBLE COUNTENANCE AS THE LOWER TUSKS CURVE UPWARD TO SHARP POINTS WHICH END ABOUT WHERE THE EYES OF EARTHLY HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOCATED
446-123501-0019 THE WHITENESS OF THE TEETH IS NOT THAT OF IVORY BUT OF THE SNOWIEST AND MOST GLEAMING OF CHINA AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THEIR OLIVE SKINS THEIR TUSKS STAND OUT IN A MOST STRIKING MANNER
446-123501-0021 ON SUCH A LITTLE THING MY LIFE HUNG THAT I OFTEN MARVEL THAT I ESCAPED SO EASILY HAD NOT THE RIFLE OF THE LEADER OF THE PARTY SWUNG FROM ITS FASTENINGS BESIDE HIS SADDLE IN SUCH A WAY
446-123501-0022 AS TO STRIKE AGAINST THE BUTT OF HIS GREAT METAL SHOD SPEAR I SHOULD HAVE SNUFFED OUT WITHOUT EVER KNOWING THAT DEATH WAS NEAR ME BUT THE LITTLE SOUND CAUSED ME TO TURN
446-123501-0024 OF THE LITTLE DEVILS I HAD BEEN WATCHING BUT HOW PUNY AND HARMLESS THEY NOW LOOKED BESIDE THIS HUGE AND TERRIFIC INCARNATION OF HATE OF VENGEANCE AND OF DEATH
446-123501-0025 WAS FULLY FIFTEEN FEET IN HEIGHT
446-123501-0027 HIS TWO LEFT ARMS WERE OUTSTRETCHED LATERALLY TO HELP PRESERVE HIS BALANCE THE THING HE RODE HAVING NEITHER BRIDLE OR REINS OF ANY DESCRIPTION FOR GUIDANCE AND HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0028 HOW CAN EARTHLY WORDS DESCRIBE IT IT TOWERED TEN FEET AT THE SHOULDER HAD FOUR LEGS ON EITHER SIDE A BROAD FLAT TAIL LARGER AT THE TIP THAN AT THE ROOT AND WHICH IT HELD
446-123501-0030 ITS BELLY WAS WHITE AND ITS LEGS SHADED FROM THE SLATE OF ITS SHOULDERS AND HIPS TO A VIVID YELLOW AT THE FEET THE FEET THEMSELVES WERE HEAVILY PADDED AND NAILLESS
446-123501-0031 WHICH FACT HAD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE NOISELESSNESS OF THEIR APPROACH AND IN COMMON WITH A MULTIPLICITY OF LEGS IS A CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THE FAUNA OF MARS THE HIGHEST TYPE OF MAN
446-123501-0033 TRAILED NINETEEN OTHERS SIMILAR IN ALL RESPECTS BUT AS I LEARNED LATER BEARING INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS PECULIAR TO THEMSELVES PRECISELY
446-123501-0034 AS NO TWO OF US ARE IDENTICAL ALTHOUGH WE ARE ALL CAST IN A SIMILAR MOLD THIS PICTURE OR RATHER MATERIALIZED NIGHTMARE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED AT LENGTH
446-123501-0036 OF THE POINT OF THE CHARGING SPEAR CONSEQUENTLY I GAVE A VERY EARTHLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SUPERHUMAN LEAP TO REACH THE TOP OF THE MARTIAN INCUBATOR FOR SUCH I HAD DETERMINED IT MUST BE
446-123501-0037 MY EFFORT WAS CROWNED WITH A SUCCESS WHICH APPALLED ME NO LESS THAN IT SEEMED TO SURPRISE THE MARTIAN WARRIORS FOR IT CARRIED ME FULLY THIRTY FEET INTO THE AIR AND LANDED ME A HUNDRED FEET
446-123501-0039 SOME WERE SURVEYING ME WITH EXPRESSIONS WHICH I AFTERWARD DISCOVERED MARKED EXTREME ASTONISHMENT AND THE OTHERS WERE EVIDENTLY SATISFYING THEMSELVES THAT I HAD NOT MOLESTED THEIR YOUNG
446-123501-0040 THEY WERE CONVERSING TOGETHER IN LOW TONES AND GESTICULATING AND POINTING TOWARD ME THEIR DISCOVERY THAT I HAD NOT HARMED THE LITTLE MARTIANS AND THAT I WAS UNARMED MUST HAVE CAUSED THEM
446-123501-0042 AND I DOUBT THAT WERE ONE OF THEM SUDDENLY TO BE TRANSPORTED TO EARTH HE COULD LIFT HIS OWN WEIGHT FROM THE GROUND IN FACT I AM CONVINCED THAT HE COULD NOT DO SO MY FEAT THEN WAS AS MARVELOUS UPON MARS
446-123501-0043 AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UPON EARTH AND FROM DESIRING TO ANNIHILATE ME THEY SUDDENLY LOOKED UPON ME AS A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY TO BE CAPTURED AND EXHIBITED AMONG THEIR FELLOWS THE RESPITE
446-123501-0045 THEY ARE DEADLY IN THE EXTREME
446-123501-0046 WHICH WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE ON EARTH THE THEORETIC EFFECTIVE RADIUS OF THIS RIFLE IS THREE HUNDRED MILES BUT THE BEST THEY CAN DO IN ACTUAL SERVICE
446-123501-0048 AND SOME TELEPATHIC FORCE MUST HAVE WARNED ME AGAINST AN ATTEMPT TO ESCAPE IN BROAD DAYLIGHT FROM UNDER THE MUZZLES OF TWENTY OF THESE DEATH DEALING MACHINES
446-123501-0049 WHEN THEY HAD COVERED PERHAPS TWO HUNDRED YARDS THEY HALTED AND TURNING THEIR MOUNTS TOWARD US SAT WATCHING THE WARRIOR BY THE ENCLOSURE HE WAS THE ONE WHOSE SPEAR HAD SO NEARLY TRANSFIXED ME
446-123501-0051 WHEN HE WAS WITHIN ABOUT FIFTY FEET OF ME HE UNCLASPED AN ENORMOUS METAL ARMLET AND HOLDING IT TOWARD ME IN THE OPEN PALM OF HIS HAND ADDRESSED ME IN A CLEAR RESONANT VOICE
446-123501-0052 HE THEN STOPPED AS THOUGH WAITING FOR MY REPLY PRICKING UP HIS ANTENNAE LIKE EARS AND COCKING HIS STRANGE LOOKING EYES STILL FURTHER TOWARD ME AS THE SILENCE BECAME PAINFUL
446-123501-0054 SO WHY NOT THEN ON MARS PLACING MY HAND OVER MY HEART I BOWED LOW TO THE MARTIAN AND EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT WHILE I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIS LANGUAGE
446-123501-0055 HIS ACTIONS SPOKE FOR THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT WERE MOST DEAR TO MY HEART OF COURSE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BABBLING BROOK FOR ALL THE INTELLIGENCE MY SPEECH CARRIED TO HIM
446-123501-0057 SMILED AT HIM AND STOOD WAITING HIS WIDE MOUTH SPREAD INTO AN ANSWERING SMILE AND LOCKING ONE OF HIS INTERMEDIARY ARMS IN MINE WE TURNED AND WALKED BACK TOWARD HIS MOUNT
446-123501-0058 AT THE SAME TIME HE MOTIONED HIS FOLLOWERS TO ADVANCE THEY STARTED TOWARD US ON A WILD RUN
446-123501-0060 THE FELLOW DESIGNATED REACHED DOWN TWO OR THREE HANDS AND LIFTED ME UP BEHIND HIM ON THE GLOSSY BACK OF HIS MOUNT
446-123502-0000 CHAPTER FOUR A PRISONER WE HAD GONE PERHAPS TEN MILES WHEN THE GROUND BEGAN TO RISE VERY RAPIDLY WE WERE AS I WAS LATER TO LEARN NEARING THE EDGE OF ONE OF MARS LONG DEAD SEAS IN THE BOTTOM OF WHICH
446-123502-0002 AN ENORMOUS CITY TOWARD THIS WE GALLOPED ENTERING IT BY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A RUINED ROADWAY LEADING OUT FROM THE CITY BUT ONLY TO THE EDGE OF THE TABLE LAND WHERE IT ENDED ABRUPTLY IN A FLIGHT OF BROAD STEPS
446-123502-0003 UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION I SAW AS WE PASSED THEM THAT THE BUILDINGS WERE DESERTED AND WHILE NOT GREATLY DECAYED HAD THE APPEARANCE OF NOT HAVING BEEN TENANTED FOR YEARS POSSIBLY FOR AGES
446-123502-0005 FOR SUCH I NOW CONSIDERED THEM DESPITE THE SUAVE MANNER IN WHICH I HAD BEEN TRAPPED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THEIR ORNAMENTS ALL WERE NAKED THE WOMEN VARIED IN APPEARANCE BUT LITTLE FROM THE MEN EXCEPT THAT THEIR TUSKS WERE MUCH LARGER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR HEIGHT
446-123502-0006 IN SOME INSTANCES CURVING NEARLY TO THEIR HIGH SET EARS THEIR BODIES WERE SMALLER AND LIGHTER IN COLOR AND THEIR FINGERS AND TOES BORE THE RUDIMENTS OF NAILS WHICH WERE ENTIRELY LACKING AMONG THE MALES
446-123502-0008 WHICH LEADS NO LIVING MARTIAN KNOWS WHITHER AND FROM WHOSE BOSOM NO MARTIAN HAS EVER RETURNED OR WOULD BE ALLOWED TO LIVE DID HE RETURN AFTER ONCE EMBARKING UPON ITS COLD DARK WATERS
446-123502-0009 ONLY ABOUT ONE MARTIAN IN A THOUSAND DIES OF SICKNESS OR DISEASE AND POSSIBLY ABOUT TWENTY TAKE THE VOLUNTARY PILGRIMAGE THE OTHER NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE DIE VIOLENT DEATHS IN DUELS IN HUNTING
446-123502-0011 THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF A MARTIAN AFTER THE AGE OF MATURITY IS ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS BUT WOULD BE NEARER THE ONE THOUSAND MARK WERE IT NOT FOR THE VARIOUS MEANS LEADING TO VIOLENT DEATH
446-123502-0012 OWING TO THE WANING RESOURCES OF THE PLANET IT EVIDENTLY BECAME NECESSARY TO COUNTERACT THE INCREASING LONGEVITY WHICH THEIR REMARKABLE SKILL IN THERAPEUTICS AND SURGERY PRODUCED
446-123502-0014 WITHOUT A WEAPON OF DESTRUCTION AS WE NEARED THE PLAZA AND MY PRESENCE WAS DISCOVERED WE WERE IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDED BY HUNDREDS OF THE CREATURES WHO SEEMED ANXIOUS TO PLUCK ME FROM MY SEAT BEHIND MY GUARD A WORD FROM THE LEADER OF THE PARTY
446-123502-0015 STILLED THEIR CLAMOR AND WE PROCEEDED AT A TROT ACROSS THE PLAZA TO THE ENTRANCE OF AS MAGNIFICENT AN EDIFICE AS MORTAL EYE HAS RESTED UPON THE BUILDING WAS LOW BUT COVERED AN ENORMOUS AREA
446-123502-0017 TO FORM A HUGE CANOPY ABOVE THE ENTRANCE HALL THERE WAS NO STAIRWAY BUT A GENTLE INCLINE TO THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE BUILDING OPENED INTO AN ENORMOUS CHAMBER ENCIRCLED BY GALLERIES ON THE FLOOR OF THIS CHAMBER
446-123502-0018 WHICH WAS DOTTED WITH HIGHLY CARVED WOODEN DESKS AND CHAIRS WERE ASSEMBLED ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY MALE MARTIANS AROUND THE STEPS OF A ROSTRUM ON THE PLATFORM PROPER
446-123502-0020 ABOUT THIS ASSEMBLAGE AND THE HALL IN WHICH THEY WERE CONGREGATED WAS THE FACT THAT THE CREATURES WERE ENTIRELY OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE DESKS CHAIRS AND OTHER FURNISHINGS THESE BEING OF A SIZE ADAPTED TO HUMAN BEINGS SUCH AS I
446-123502-0021 WHEREAS THE GREAT BULKS OF THE MARTIANS
446-123502-0023 AND AT A SIGN FROM THE LEADER I HAD BEEN LOWERED TO THE GROUND AGAIN LOCKING HIS ARM IN MINE WE HAD PROCEEDED INTO THE AUDIENCE CHAMBER THERE WERE FEW FORMALITIES OBSERVED IN APPROACHING THE MARTIAN CHIEFTAIN
446-123502-0024 MY CAPTOR MERELY STRODE UP TO THE ROSTRUM THE OTHERS MAKING WAY FOR HIM AS HE ADVANCED THE CHIEFTAIN ROSE TO HIS FEET AND UTTERED THE NAME OF MY ESCORT WHO IN TURN HALTED AND REPEATED THE NAME OF THE RULER FOLLOWED BY HIS TITLE
446-123502-0026 HAD THEIR MISSIONS BEEN PEACEFUL OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE EXCHANGED SHOTS OR HAVE FOUGHT OUT THEIR INTRODUCTION WITH SOME OTHER OF THEIR VARIOUS WEAPONS MY CAPTOR WHOSE NAME WAS TARS TARKAS
446-123502-0027 AND WHEN HE HAD CONCLUDED THE CHIEFTAIN ADDRESSED ME AT SOME LENGTH I REPLIED IN OUR GOOD OLD ENGLISH TONGUE MERELY TO CONVINCE HIM THAT NEITHER OF US COULD UNDERSTAND THE OTHER
446-123502-0029 THEREFORE TO LAUGH DENOTING A SENSE OF HUMOR BUT I WAS TO LEARN THAT THE MARTIAN SMILE IS MERELY PERFUNCTORY AND THAT THE MARTIAN LAUGH IS A THING TO CAUSE STRONG MEN TO BLANCH IN HORROR THE IDEAS
446-123502-0030 OF INCITANTS TO MERRIMENT THE DEATH AGONIES OF A FELLOW BEING ARE TO THESE STRANGE CREATURES PROVOCATIVE OF THE WILDEST HILARITY WHILE THEIR CHIEF FORM OF COMMONEST AMUSEMENT
446-123502-0032 THE PRINCIPAL CHIEFTAIN THEN EVIDENTLY SIGNIFIED A DESIRE TO SEE ME PERFORM AND MOTIONING ME TO FOLLOW HE STARTED WITH TARS TARKAS FOR THE OPEN PLAZA NOW I HAD MADE NO ATTEMPT TO WALK SINCE MY FIRST SIGNAL FAILURE
446-123502-0033 AND SO NOW I WENT SKIPPING AND FLITTING ABOUT AMONG THE DESKS AND CHAIRS LIKE SOME MONSTROUS GRASSHOPPER AFTER BRUISING MYSELF SEVERELY
446-123502-0035 AS HE SUNK TO THE FLOOR I WHEELED AROUND WITH MY BACK TOWARD THE NEAREST DESK EXPECTING TO BE OVERWHELMED BY THE VENGEANCE OF HIS FELLOWS BUT DETERMINED TO GIVE THEM AS GOOD A BATTLE AS THE UNEQUAL ODDS WOULD PERMIT BEFORE I GAVE UP MY LIFE
446-123502-0036 MY FEARS WERE GROUNDLESS HOWEVER AS THE OTHER MARTIANS AT FIRST STRUCK DUMB WITH WONDERMENT FINALLY BROKE INTO WILD PEALS OF LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I DID NOT RECOGNIZE THE APPLAUSE AS SUCH BUT LATER
446-123502-0038 BUT I WAS NOT LONG IN BEING ENLIGHTENED THEY FIRST REPEATED THE WORD SAK A NUMBER OF TIMES AND THEN TARS TARKAS MADE SEVERAL JUMPS REPEATING THE SAME WORD BEFORE EACH LEAP THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID SAK
446-123502-0039 I SAW WHAT THEY WERE AFTER AND GATHERING MYSELF TOGETHER I SAKKED WITH SUCH MARVELOUS SUCCESS THAT I CLEARED A GOOD HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET NOR DID I THIS TIME LOSE MY EQUILIBRIUM BUT LANDED SQUARELY UPON MY FEET
446-123502-0041 WHICH THE CHIEFTAIN THEN ORDERED ME TO MAKE BUT I WAS BOTH HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND DETERMINED ON THE SPOT THAT MY ONLY METHOD OF SALVATION WAS TO DEMAND THE CONSIDERATION FROM THESE CREATURES
446-123502-0042 WHICH THEY EVIDENTLY WOULD NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCORD I THEREFORE IGNORED THE REPEATED COMMANDS TO SAK AND EACH TIME THEY WERE MADE I MOTIONED TO MY MOUTH AND RUBBED MY STOMACH
446-123502-0044 I GRASPED HER PROFFERED ARM AND TOGETHER WE CROSSED THE PLAZA TOWARD A LARGE BUILDING ON THE FAR SIDE MY FAIR COMPANION WAS ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL HAVING JUST ARRIVED AT MATURITY BUT NOT YET TO HER FULL HEIGHT
446-123502-0045 SHE WAS OF A LIGHT OLIVE GREEN COLOR WITH A SMOOTH GLOSSY HIDE HER NAME AS I AFTERWARD LEARNED WAS SOLA AND SHE BELONGED TO THE RETINUE OF TARS TARKAS SHE CONDUCTED ME TO A SPACIOUS CHAMBER
446-123502-0047 AND WAS BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED WITH MURAL PAINTINGS AND MOSAICS
446-123502-0048 MADE A PECULIAR HISSING SOUND AS THOUGH SIGNALING TO SOMEONE IN AN ADJOINING ROOM IN RESPONSE TO HER CALL I OBTAINED MY FIRST SIGHT OF A NEW MARTIAN WONDER IT WADDLED IN ON ITS TEN SHORT LEGS AND SQUATTED DOWN BEFORE THE GIRL
458-126290-0000 BUT WE MUST MAKE A PROVISION FOR WINTER OR ELSE WE SHALL SUFFER FROM HUNGER SAID THE CAT AND YOU LITTLE MOUSE CANNOT VENTURE EVERYWHERE OR YOU WILL BE CAUGHT IN A TRAP SOME DAY THE GOOD ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED AND A POT OF FAT WAS BOUGHT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE TO PUT IT
458-126290-0001 AT LENGTH AFTER MUCH CONSIDERATION THE CAT SAID I KNOW NO PLACE WHERE IT WILL BE BETTER STORED UP THAN IN THE CHURCH FOR NO ONE DARES TAKE ANYTHING AWAY FROM THERE WE WILL SET IT BENEATH THE ALTAR AND NOT TOUCH IT UNTIL WE ARE REALLY IN NEED OF IT
458-126290-0003 MY COUSIN HAS BROUGHT A LITTLE SON INTO THE WORLD AND HAS ASKED ME TO BE GODMOTHER HE IS WHITE WITH BROWN SPOTS AND I AM TO HOLD HIM OVER THE FONT AT THE CHRISTENING
458-126290-0004 AND YOU LOOK AFTER THE HOUSE BY YOURSELF YES YES ANSWERED THE MOUSE BY ALL MEANS GO AND IF YOU GET ANYTHING VERY GOOD TO EAT THINK OF ME I SHOULD LIKE A DROP OF SWEET RED CHRISTENING WINE MYSELF ALL THIS HOWEVER WAS UNTRUE
458-126290-0006 AND THEN STRETCHED HERSELF IN THE SUN AND LICKED HER LIPS WHENEVER SHE THOUGHT OF THE POT OF FAT AND NOT UNTIL IT WAS EVENING DID SHE RETURN HOME WELL HERE YOU ARE AGAIN SAID THE MOUSE NO DOUBT YOU HAVE HAD A MERRY DAY ALL WENT OFF WELL ANSWERED THE CAT
458-126290-0007 WHAT NAME DID THEY GIVE THE CHILD TOP OFF SAID THE CAT QUITE COOLLY TOP OFF CRIED THE MOUSE THAT IS A VERY ODD AND UNCOMMON NAME IS IT A USUAL ONE IN YOUR FAMILY
458-126290-0009 AS THE CHILD HAS A WHITE RING ROUND ITS NECK I CANNOT REFUSE THE GOOD MOUSE CONSENTED BUT THE CAT CREPT BEHIND THE TOWN WALLS TO THE CHURCH AND DEVOURED HALF THE POT OF FAT NOTHING EVER SEEMS SO GOOD AS WHAT ONE KEEPS TO ONESELF
458-126290-0010 WHEN SHE WENT HOME THE MOUSE INQUIRED AND WHAT WAS THE CHILD CHRISTENED HALF DONE ANSWERED THE CAT HALF DONE
458-126290-0012 ONLY IT HAS WHITE PAWS BUT WITH THAT EXCEPTION IT HAS NOT A SINGLE WHITE HAIR ON ITS WHOLE BODY THIS ONLY HAPPENS ONCE EVERY FEW YEARS YOU WILL LET ME GO WON'T YOU TOP OFF HALF DONE ANSWERED THE MOUSE THEY ARE SUCH ODD NAMES THEY MAKE ME VERY THOUGHTFUL
458-126290-0013 YOU SIT AT HOME SAID THE CAT IN YOUR DARK GREY FUR COAT AND LONG TAIL AND ARE FILLED WITH FANCIES THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DO NOT GO OUT IN THE DAYTIME DURING THE CAT'S ABSENCE THE MOUSE CLEANED THE HOUSE AND PUT IT IN ORDER BUT THE GREEDY CAT ENTIRELY EMPTIED THE POT OF FAT
458-126290-0015 THAT IS THE MOST SUSPICIOUS NAME OF ALL I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IN PRINT ALL GONE WHAT CAN THAT MEAN AND SHE SHOOK HER HEAD CURLED HERSELF UP AND LAY DOWN TO SLEEP FROM THIS TIME FORTH NO ONE INVITED THE CAT TO BE GODMOTHER
458-126290-0016 BUT WHEN THE WINTER HAD COME AND THERE WAS NO LONGER ANYTHING TO BE FOUND OUTSIDE THE MOUSE THOUGHT OF THEIR PROVISION AND SAID COME CAT WE WILL GO TO OUR POT OF FAT WHICH WE HAVE STORED UP FOR OURSELVES WE SHALL ENJOY THAT YES ANSWERED THE CAT
458-126290-0018 YOU HAVE DEVOURED ALL WHEN YOU WERE STANDING GODMOTHER FIRST TOP OFF THEN HALF DONE THEN WILL YOU HOLD YOUR TONGUE CRIED THE CAT
458-126290-0019 ALL GONE WAS ALREADY ON THE POOR MOUSE'S LIPS
458-126294-0001 FOR THE MOTHER HAD FALLEN ASLEEP UNDER THE TREE WITH THE CHILD
458-126294-0002 AND SET IT ON THE HIGH TREE THE FORESTER CLIMBED UP BROUGHT THE CHILD DOWN AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF YOU WILL TAKE HIM HOME WITH YOU AND BRING HIM UP WITH YOUR LINA HE TOOK IT HOME THEREFORE AND THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER AND THE ONE
458-126294-0004 AND DID NOT GO ONCE ONLY BUT MANY TIMES OUT TO THE SPRING LINA SAW THIS AND SAID LISTEN OLD SANNA WHY ARE YOU FETCHING SO MUCH WATER IF YOU WILL NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE I WILL TELL YOU WHY SO LINA SAID NO
458-126294-0005 SHE WOULD NEVER REPEAT IT TO ANYONE AND THEN THE COOK SAID EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN THE FORESTER IS OUT HUNTING I WILL HEAT THE WATER AND WHEN IT IS BOILING IN THE KETTLE I WILL THROW IN FUNDEVOGEL AND WILL BOIL HIM IN IT EARLY NEXT MORNING THE FORESTER GOT UP AND WENT OUT HUNTING
458-126294-0007 LAST NIGHT OLD SANNA CARRIED SO MANY BUCKETS OF WATER INTO THE HOUSE THAT I ASKED HER WHY SHE WAS DOING THAT AND SHE SAID THAT IF I WOULD PROMISE NOT TO TELL ANYONE AND SHE SAID THAT EARLY TOMORROW MORNING WHEN FATHER WAS OUT HUNTING SHE WOULD SET THE KETTLE FULL OF WATER
458-126294-0008 THROW YOU INTO IT AND BOIL YOU BUT WE WILL GET UP QUICKLY DRESS OURSELVES AND GO AWAY TOGETHER THE TWO CHILDREN THEREFORE GOT UP DRESSED THEMSELVES QUICKLY AND WENT AWAY WHEN THE WATER IN THE KETTLE WAS BOILING
458-126294-0010 THEY MUST BE FOLLOWED INSTANTLY TO GET THEM BACK AGAIN THEN THE COOK SENT THREE SERVANTS AFTER THEM WHO WERE TO RUN AND OVERTAKE THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER WERE SITTING OUTSIDE THE FOREST AND WHEN THEY SAW FROM AFAR THE THREE SERVANTS RUNNING LINA SAID TO FUNDEVOGEL NEVER LEAVE ME
458-126294-0011 AND I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU FUNDEVOGEL SAID NEITHER NOW NOR EVER
458-126294-0013 AND THEY WENT HOME AND TOLD THE COOK THAT THEY HAD SEEN NOTHING IN THE FOREST BUT A LITTLE ROSE BUSH WITH ONE ROSE ON IT
458-126294-0014 YOU SIMPLETONS YOU SHOULD HAVE CUT THE ROSE BUSH IN TWO AND HAVE BROKEN OFF THE ROSE AND BROUGHT IT HOME WITH YOU GO AND DO IT AT ONCE THEY HAD THEREFORE TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR THE SECOND TIME THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW THEM COMING FROM A DISTANCE THEN LINA SAID FUNDEVOGEL
458-126294-0016 THEY SAID THEREFORE TO EACH OTHER WHAT CAN WE DO HERE LET US GO HOME WHEN THEY GOT HOME THE COOK ASKED IF THEY HAD NOT FOUND THEM SO THEY SAID NO THEY HAD FOUND NOTHING BUT A CHURCH AND THERE WAS A CHANDELIER IN IT AND THE COOK SCOLDED THEM AND SAID
458-126294-0017 YOU FOOLS WHY DID YOU NOT PULL THE CHURCH TO PIECES AND BRING THE CHANDELIER HOME WITH YOU AND NOW THE OLD COOK HERSELF GOT ON HER LEGS AND WENT WITH THE THREE SERVANTS IN PURSUIT OF THE CHILDREN THE CHILDREN HOWEVER SAW FROM AFAR THAT THE THREE SERVANTS WERE COMING
458-126305-0000 THE LITTLE PEASANT THERE WAS A CERTAIN VILLAGE WHEREIN NO ONE LIVED BUT REALLY RICH PEASANTS AND JUST ONE POOR ONE WHOM THEY CALLED THE LITTLE PEASANT HE HAD NOT EVEN SO MUCH AS A COW AND STILL LESS MONEY TO BUY ONE
458-126305-0001 AND YET HE AND HIS WIFE DID SO WISH TO HAVE ONE ONE DAY HE SAID TO HER LISTEN I HAVE A GOOD IDEA THERE IS OUR GOSSIP THE CARPENTER HE SHALL MAKE US A WOODEN CALF AND PAINT IT BROWN SO THAT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER AND IN TIME
458-126305-0003 THE LITTLE PEASANT CALLED THE COW HERD IN AND SAID LOOK I HAVE A LITTLE CALF THERE BUT IT IS STILL SMALL AND HAS TO BE CARRIED THE COW HERD SAID ALL RIGHT AND TOOK IT IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED IT TO THE PASTURE AND SET IT AMONG THE GRASS
458-126305-0004 THE LITTLE CALF ALWAYS REMAINED STANDING LIKE ONE WHICH WAS EATING AND THE COW HERD SAID IT WILL SOON RUN BY ITSELF JUST LOOK HOW IT EATS ALREADY AT NIGHT WHEN HE WAS GOING TO DRIVE THE HERD HOME AGAIN HE SAID TO THE CALF
458-126305-0006 AND WHEN THE COW HERD DROVE THE COWS THROUGH THE VILLAGE AND THE CALF WAS MISSING HE INQUIRED WHERE IT WAS THE COW HERD ANSWERED IT IS STILL STANDING OUT THERE EATING IT WOULD NOT STOP AND COME WITH US BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID
458-126305-0007 OH BUT I MUST HAVE MY BEAST BACK AGAIN THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE MEADOW TOGETHER BUT SOMEONE HAD STOLEN THE CALF AND IT WAS GONE THE COW HERD SAID IT MUST HAVE RUN AWAY THE PEASANT HOWEVER SAID DON'T TELL ME THAT
458-126305-0009 BUT THEY HAD NO FOOD FOR IT AND COULD GIVE IT NOTHING TO EAT SO IT SOON HAD TO BE KILLED THEY SALTED THE FLESH AND THE PEASANT WENT INTO THE TOWN AND WANTED TO SELL THE SKIN THERE SO THAT HE MIGHT BUY A NEW CALF WITH THE PROCEEDS ON THE WAY HE PASSED BY A MILL
458-126305-0010 AND THERE SAT A RAVEN WITH BROKEN WINGS AND OUT OF PITY HE TOOK HIM AND WRAPPED HIM IN THE SKIN BUT AS THE WEATHER GREW SO BAD AND THERE WAS A STORM OF RAIN AND WIND HE COULD GO NO FARTHER AND TURNED BACK TO THE MILL AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0012 IN THE MEANTIME CAME THE PARSON THE MILLER'S WIFE RECEIVED HIM WELL AND SAID MY HUSBAND IS OUT SO WE WILL HAVE A FEAST THE PEASANT LISTENED AND WHEN HE HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT FEASTING HE WAS VEXED THAT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO MAKE SHIFT WITH A SLICE OF BREAD AND CHEESE
458-126305-0013 THEN THE WOMAN SERVED UP FOUR DIFFERENT THINGS ROAST MEAT SALAD CAKES AND WINE JUST AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO SIT DOWN AND EAT THERE WAS A KNOCKING OUTSIDE THE WOMAN SAID OH HEAVENS IT IS MY HUSBAND SHE QUICKLY HID THE ROAST MEAT INSIDE THE TILED STOVE
458-126305-0015 THERE IS SUCH A STORM IT LOOKS AS IF THE WORLD WERE COMING TO AN END THE MILLER SAW THE PEASANT LYING ON THE STRAW AND ASKED WHAT IS THAT FELLOW DOING THERE AH SAID THE WIFE THE POOR KNAVE CAME IN THE STORM AND RAIN AND BEGGED FOR SHELTER
458-126305-0016 THE MAN SAID I HAVE NO OBJECTION BUT BE QUICK AND GET ME SOMETHING TO EAT THE WOMAN SAID BUT I HAVE NOTHING BUT BREAD AND CHEESE I AM CONTENTED WITH ANYTHING REPLIED THE HUSBAND SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED BREAD AND CHEESE WILL DO AND LOOKED AT THE PEASANT AND SAID
458-126305-0018 CAN HE FORETELL ANYTHING TO ME SAID THE MILLER WHY NOT ANSWERED THE PEASANT BUT HE ONLY SAYS FOUR THINGS AND THE FIFTH HE KEEPS TO HIMSELF THE MILLER WAS CURIOUS AND SAID
458-126305-0019 AND WENT THITHER AND FOUND THE ROAST MEAT
458-126305-0021 FOURTHLY HE SAYS THAT THERE ARE SOME CAKES UNDER THE BED THAT WOULD BE A FINE THING CRIED THE MILLER AND LOOKED THERE AND FOUND THE CAKES AND NOW THE TWO SAT DOWN TO THE TABLE TOGETHER BUT THE MILLER'S WIFE WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH AND WENT TO BED AND TOOK ALL THE KEYS WITH HER
458-126305-0022 THE MILLER WOULD HAVE LIKED MUCH TO KNOW THE FIFTH BUT THE LITTLE PEASANT SAID FIRST WE WILL QUICKLY EAT THE FOUR THINGS FOR THE FIFTH IS SOMETHING BAD SO THEY ATE AND AFTER THAT THEY BARGAINED HOW MUCH THE MILLER WAS TO GIVE FOR THE FIFTH PROPHECY
458-126305-0024 THE DEVIL MUST GO OUT AND OPENED THE HOUSE DOOR THEN THE WOMAN WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP THE KEYS AND THE PEASANT UNLOCKED THE CLOSET THE PARSON RAN OUT AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE MILLER SAID IT WAS TRUE I SAW THE BLACK RASCAL WITH MY OWN EYES
458-126305-0025 THE PEASANT HOWEVER MADE OFF NEXT MORNING BY DAYBREAK WITH THE THREE HUNDRED TALERS AT HOME THE SMALL PEASANT GRADUALLY LAUNCHED OUT HE BUILT A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE AND THE PEASANTS SAID THE SMALL PEASANT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN TO THE PLACE WHERE GOLDEN SNOW FALLS
458-126305-0027 AND RAN HOME KILLED ALL THEIR COWS AND STRIPPED OFF THEIR SKINS IN ORDER TO SELL THEM IN THE TOWN TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE THE MAYOR HOWEVER SAID BUT MY SERVANT MUST GO FIRST
458-126305-0028 AND WHEN THE OTHERS CAME HE DID NOT GIVE THEM SO MUCH AND SAID WHAT CAN I DO WITH ALL THESE SKINS THEN THE PEASANTS WERE VEXED THAT THE SMALL PEASANT SHOULD HAVE THUS OUTWITTED THEM WANTED TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON HIM AND ACCUSED HIM OF THIS TREACHERY BEFORE THE MAYOR
458-126305-0030 THE OTHERS WERE ALL OBLIGED TO RETIRE TO A DISTANCE AND WHEN THE PEASANT LOOKED AT THE PRIEST HE RECOGNIZED THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN WITH THE MILLER'S WIFE HE SAID TO HIM I SET YOU FREE FROM THE CLOSET SET ME FREE FROM THE BARREL AT THIS SAME MOMENT UP CAME
458-126305-0031 WITH A FLOCK OF SHEEP THE VERY SHEPHERD WHOM THE PEASANT KNEW HAD LONG BEEN WISHING TO BE MAYOR
458-126305-0033 MYSELF IN THE BARREL BUT I WILL NOT DO IT THE SHEPHERD SAID
458-126305-0034 I WOULD GET INTO THE BARREL AT ONCE
458-126305-0036 THE PARSON WENT TO THE CROWD AND DECLARED THAT THE MASS HAD BEEN SAID THEN THEY CAME AND ROLLED THE BARREL TOWARDS THE WATER WHEN THE BARREL BEGAN TO ROLL THE SHEPHERD CRIED I AM QUITE WILLING TO BE MAYOR THEY BELIEVED NO OTHERWISE
458-126305-0037 THAN THAT IT WAS THE PEASANT WHO WAS SAYING THIS AND ANSWERED THAT IS WHAT WE INTEND BUT FIRST YOU SHALL LOOK ABOUT YOU A LITTLE DOWN BELOW THERE AND THEY ROLLED THE BARREL DOWN INTO THE WATER AFTER THAT THE PEASANTS WENT HOME
458-126305-0039 I SANK DEEP DEEP DOWN UNTIL AT LAST I GOT TO THE BOTTOM
458-126305-0040 OUT OF THE BARREL AND CREPT OUT AND THERE WERE PRETTY MEADOWS ON WHICH A NUMBER OF LAMBS WERE FEEDING AND FROM THENCE I BROUGHT THIS FLOCK AWAY WITH ME SAID THE PEASANTS ARE THERE ANY MORE THERE
458-126305-0042 WHEREUPON THE PEASANTS CRIED WE ALREADY SEE THE SHEEP DOWN BELOW THE MAYOR PRESSED FORWARD AND SAID I WILL GO DOWN FIRST AND LOOK ABOUT ME AND IF THINGS PROMISE WELL I'LL CALL YOU
460-172357-0000 I KNOW NO WAY IN WHICH A WRITER MAY MORE FITTINGLY INTRODUCE HIS WORK TO THE PUBLIC THAN BY GIVING A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF WHO AND WHAT HE IS BY THIS MEANS SOME OF THE BLAME FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE IS VERY PROPERLY SHIFTED TO THE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS LIFE
460-172357-0002 AND MY FATHER WAS JUST ABLE BY GREAT DILIGENCE TO PAY THE HIRED MEN AND IN YEARS OF PLENTY TO RAISE ENOUGH GRAIN TO HAVE SEED FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S CROP WITHOUT BUYING ANY BY THIS PROCESS MY BROTHERS AND I WERE INEVITABLY DRIVEN OFF THE LAND
460-172357-0003 THAT IS INDUCED BY HONEST MANUAL TOIL I WAS EDUCATED AT UPPER CANADA COLLEGE TORONTO OF WHICH I WAS HEAD BOY IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FROM THERE I WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO WHERE I GRADUATED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE
460-172357-0005 IN OTHER WORDS I WAS WHAT IS CALLED A DISTINGUISHED GRADUATE AND AS SUCH I TOOK TO SCHOOL TEACHING AS THE ONLY TRADE I COULD FIND THAT NEED NEITHER EXPERIENCE NOR INTELLECT I SPENT MY TIME FROM EIGHTEEN NINETY ONE TO EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE ON THE STAFF OF UPPER CANADA COLLEGE
460-172357-0006 AN EXPERIENCE WHICH HAS LEFT ME WITH A PROFOUND SYMPATHY FOR THE MANY GIFTED AND BRILLIANT MEN WHO ARE COMPELLED TO SPEND THEIR LIVES IN THE MOST DREARY THE MOST THANKLESS AND THE WORST PAID PROFESSION IN THE WORLD
460-172357-0008 AFTER THIS NO NEW IDEAS CAN BE IMPARTED TO HIM FROM THIS TIME AND SINCE MY MARRIAGE WHICH HAD OCCURRED AT THIS PERIOD I HAVE BELONGED TO THE STAFF OF MC GILL UNIVERSITY FIRST AS LECTURER IN POLITICAL SCIENCE AND LATER AS HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
460-172357-0009 I AM ABLE TO REGARD MYSELF AS SINGULARLY FORTUNATE THE EMOLUMENT IS SO HIGH AS TO PLACE ME DISTINCTLY ABOVE THE POLICEMEN POSTMEN STREET CAR CONDUCTORS AND OTHER SALARIED OFFICIALS OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD
460-172357-0011 AN ABILITY TO THINK AND WHAT IS STILL BETTER TO STOP THINKING ALTOGETHER FOR MONTHS AT A TIME I HAVE WRITTEN A NUMBER OF THINGS IN CONNECTION WITH MY COLLEGE LIFE A BOOK ON POLITICAL SCIENCE AND MANY ESSAYS MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND SO ON
460-172357-0012 A FEW YEARS AGO I WENT ALL ROUND THE BRITISH EMPIRE DELIVERING ADDRESSES ON IMPERIAL ORGANIZATION WHEN I STATE THAT THESE LECTURES WERE FOLLOWED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BY THE UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA THE BANANA RIOTS IN TRINIDAD AND THE TURCO ITALIAN WAR
460-172357-0014 AND THE OTHER NONSENSE NOVELS EACH OF THESE IS PUBLISHED BY JOHN LANE LONDON AND NEW YORK AND EITHER OF THEM CAN BE OBTAINED ABSURD THOUGH IT SOUNDS FOR THE MERE SUM OF THREE SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE ANY READER OF THIS PREFACE FOR EXAMPLE RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT APPEARS
460-172357-0015 COULD WALK INTO A BOOKSTORE AND BUY BOTH OF THESE BOOKS FOR SEVEN SHILLINGS YET THESE WORKS ARE OF SO HUMOROUS A CHARACTER THAT FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO PRINT THEM THE COMPOSITORS FELL BACK FROM THEIR TASK SUFFOCATED WITH LAUGHTER AND GASPING FOR AIR
460-172357-0017 BUT TO WRITE SOMETHING OUT OF ONE'S OWN MIND WORTH READING FOR ITS OWN SAKE IS AN ARDUOUS CONTRIVANCE ONLY TO BE ACHIEVED IN FORTUNATE MOMENTS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
460-172357-0018 IN REGARD TO THE PRESENT WORK I MUST DISCLAIM AT ONCE ALL INTENTIONS OF TRYING TO DO ANYTHING SO RIDICULOUSLY EASY AS WRITING ABOUT A REAL PLACE AND REAL PEOPLE MARIPOSA IS NOT A REAL TOWN ON THE CONTRARY IT IS ABOUT SEVENTY OR EIGHTY OF THEM
460-172357-0020 TO MAKE HIM I CLAPPED THE GAITERS OF ONE ECCLESIASTIC ROUND THE LEGS OF ANOTHER ADDED THE SERMONS OF A THIRD AND THE CHARACTER OF A FOURTH AND SO LET HIM START ON HIS WAY IN THE BOOK TO PICK UP SUCH INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AS HE MIGHT FIND FOR HIMSELF
460-172357-0021 MULLINS AND BAGSHAW AND JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH AND THE REST ARE IT IS TRUE PERSONAL FRIENDS OF MINE BUT I HAVE KNOWN THEM IN SUCH A VARIETY OF FORMS WITH SUCH ALTERNATIONS OF TALL AND SHORT DARK AND FAIR THAT INDIVIDUALLY I SHOULD HAVE MUCH ADO TO KNOW THEM
460-172357-0023 ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN BY EVERYBODY TO BE A NECESSARY AND UNIVERSAL ADJUNCT OF THE HOTEL BUSINESS THE INSPIRATION OF THE BOOK
460-172357-0024 A LAND OF HOPE AND SUNSHINE WHERE LITTLE TOWNS SPREAD THEIR SQUARE STREETS AND THEIR TRIM MAPLE TREES BESIDE PLACID LAKES ALMOST WITHIN ECHO OF THE PRIMEVAL FOREST IS LARGE ENOUGH
460-172359-0000 IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE MINING BOOM AT THE TIME WHEN EVERYBODY WENT SIMPLY CRAZY OVER THE COBALT AND PORCUPINE MINES OF THE NEW SILVER COUNTRY NEAR THE HUDSON BAY
460-172359-0001 THERE WERE ALWAYS PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BARBER SHOP MULLINS THE MANAGER OF THE EXCHANGE BANK TOOK HIS MORNING SHAVE FROM JEFF AS A FORM OF RESUSCITATION WITH ENOUGH WET TOWELS LAID ON HIS FACE TO STEW HIM AND WITH JEFF MOVING ABOUT IN THE STEAM RAZOR IN HAND
460-172359-0003 WHAT WITH JEFF'S WHITE COAT AND MISTER SMITH'S FLOWERED WAISTCOAT AND THE RED GERANIUM IN THE WINDOW AND THE FLORIDA WATER AND THE DOUBLE EXTRACT OF HYACINTH THE LITTLE SHOP SEEMED MULTI COLOURED AND LUXURIOUS ENOUGH FOR THE ANNEX OF A SULTAN'S HAREM BUT WHAT I MEAN IS THAT
460-172359-0004 TILL THE MINING BOOM JEFFERSON THORPE NEVER OCCUPIED A POSITION OF REAL PROMINENCE IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0006 IN THE SPEECH OF MARIPOSA THE HIGHEST FORM OF ENDOWMENT WAS TO HAVE THE HEAD SET ON HORIZONTALLY AS WITH A THEODOLITE AS I SAY IT WAS WHEN JEFF MADE MONEY THAT THEY SAW HOW GIFTED HE WAS AND WHEN HE LOST IT BUT STILL THERE'S NO NEED TO GO INTO THAT
460-172359-0007 I BELIEVE IT'S SOMETHING THE SAME IN OTHER PLACES TOO THE BARBER SHOP YOU WILL REMEMBER STANDS ACROSS THE STREET FROM SMITH'S HOTEL AND STARES AT IT FACE TO FACE IT IS ONE OF THOSE WOODEN STRUCTURES I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM
460-172359-0009 AND THE SHOP ITSELF HAS A LARGE SQUARE WINDOW OUT OF PROPORTION TO ITS LITTLE FLAT FACE PAINTED ON THE PANES OF THE WINDOW IS THE REMAINS OF A LEGEND THAT ONCE SPELT BARBER SHOP EXECUTED WITH THE FLOURISHES THAT PREVAILED IN THE GOLDEN AGE OF SIGN PAINTING IN MARIPOSA
460-172359-0010 THROUGH THE WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE GERANIUMS IN THE WINDOW SHELF AND BEHIND THEM JEFF THORPE WITH HIS LITTLE BLACK SCULL CAP ON AND HIS SPECTACLES DROOPED UPON HIS NOSE AS HE BENDS FORWARD IN THE ABSORPTION OF SHAVING
460-172359-0012 IT IS THE CURRENT SUPPOSITION OF EACH OF JEFF'S CUSTOMERS THAT EVERYONE ELSE BUT HIMSELF USES A SEPARATE MUG ONE CORNER OF THE SHOP IS PARTITIONED OFF AND BEARS THE SIGN HOT AND COLD BATHS FIFTY CENTS
460-172359-0013 ONLY OLD NEWSPAPERS AND A MOP STILL IT LENDS DISTINCTION SOMEHOW JUST AS DO THE FADED CARDBOARD SIGNS THAT HANG AGAINST THE MIRROR WITH THE LEGENDS TURKISH SHAMPOO SEVENTY FIVE CENTS AND ROMAN MASSAGE ONE DOLLAR
460-172359-0015 AND AT THAT IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW HE COULD MAKE MONEY
460-172359-0016 AND THEN IN THE OTHER YOU SEE IN MARIPOSA SHAVING ISN'T THE HURRIED PERFUNCTORY THING THAT IT IS IN THE CITY A SHAVE IS LOOKED UPON AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL PLEASURE AND LASTS ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE MINUTES TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR IN THE MORNING HOURS PERHAPS THERE WAS A SEMBLANCE OF HASTE ABOUT IT
460-172359-0018 AND AS YOU WAITED YOUR TURN IN ONE OF THE WOODEN ARM CHAIRS BESIDE THE WALL WHAT WITH THE QUIET OF THE HOUR AND THE LOW DRONE OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION THE BUZZING OF THE FLIES AGAINST THE WINDOW PANE AND THE MEASURED TICK OF THE CLOCK ABOVE THE MIRROR
460-172359-0019 YOUR HEAD SANK DREAMING ON YOUR BREAST AND THE MARIPOSA NEWSPACKET RUSTLED UNHEEDED ON THE FLOOR IT MAKES ONE DROWSY JUST TO THINK OF IT THE CONVERSATION OF COURSE WAS THE REAL CHARM OF THE PLACE YOU SEE JEFFERSON'S FORTE OR SPECIALTY WAS INFORMATION
460-172359-0021 THEY READ THE WHOLE THING FROM COVER TO COVER AND THEY BUILD UP ON IT IN THE COURSE OF YEARS A RANGE OF ACQUIREMENT THAT WOULD PUT A COLLEGE PRESIDENT TO THE BLUSH
460-172359-0022 AND OF COURSE THE PECULIARITY OF JEFF'S CONVERSATION WAS THAT HE COULD SUIT IT TO HIS MAN EVERY TIME
460-172359-0024 I SEE WHERE IT SAYS THAT THIS FLYING SQUIRL RUN A DEAD HEAT FOR THE KING'S PLATE TO A HUMBLE INTELLECT LIKE MINE HE WOULD EXPLAIN IN FULL THE RELATIONS OF THE KEESAR TO THE GERMAN RICH DOG
460-172359-0025 THE HUGE FORTUNES THAT A MAN WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF HEAD COULD MAKE I'VE KNOWN JEFFERSON TO PAUSE IN HIS SHAVING WITH THE RAZOR SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AS LONG AS FIVE MINUTES WHILE HE DESCRIBED WITH HIS EYE HALF CLOSED
460-172359-0027 IT WAS PROBABLY IN HIM FROM THE START THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH THINGS AS TRACTION STOCK AND AMALGAMATED ASBESTOS WENT TO HIS HEAD AND WHENEVER HE SPOKE OF MISTER CARNEGIE AND MISTER ROCKEFELLER THE YEARNING TONE OF HIS VOICE MADE IT AS SOFT AS LATHERED SOAP
460-172359-0028 I SUPPOSE THE MOST RUDIMENTARY FORM OF HIS SPECULATION WAS THE HENS THAT WAS YEARS AGO HE KEPT THEM OUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HOUSE WHICH ITSELF STOOD UP A GRASS PLOT BEHIND AND BEYOND THE BARBER SHOP AND IN THE OLD DAYS JEFF WOULD SAY WITH A CERTAIN NOTE OF PRIDE IN HIS VOICE
460-172359-0030 I SUPPOSE A GOOD MANY OF US HAVE FELT JUST AS JEFF DID ABOUT OUR POOR LITTLE EARNINGS ANYWAY I REMEMBER JEFF TELLING ME ONE DAY THAT HE COULD TAKE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE HENS AND SELL THEM OFF AND CRACK THE MONEY INTO CHICAGO WHEAT ON MARGIN AND TURN IT OVER IN TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE DID IT TOO
460-172359-0031 AFTER THAT THE HEN HOUSE STOOD EMPTY AND THE WOMAN HAD TO THROW AWAY CHICKEN FEED EVERY DAY AT A DEAD LOSS OF PERHAPS A SHAVE AND A HALF
460-172359-0033 SO NO WONDER THE TOWN WENT WILD ALL DAY IN THE STREET YOU COULD HEAR MEN TALKING OF VEINS AND SMELTERS AND DIPS AND DEPOSITS AND FAULTS THE TOWN HUMMED WITH IT LIKE A GEOLOGY CLASS ON EXAMINATION DAY
460-172359-0034 WITHIN A FORTNIGHT THEY PUT A PARTITION DOWN ROBERTSON'S COAL AND WOOD OFFICE AND OPENED THE MARIPOSA MINING EXCHANGE AND JUST ABOUT EVERY MAN ON THE MAIN STREET STARTED BUYING SCRIP THEN PRESENTLY YOUNG FIZZLECHIP WHO HAD BEEN TELLER IN MULLINS'S BANK AND THAT EVERYBODY HAD THOUGHT A WORTHLESS JACKASS BEFORE
460-172359-0036 THEY ALL WENT IN JIM ELIOT MORTGAGED THE INSIDE OF THE DRUG STORE AND JAMMED IT INTO TWIN TAMAGAMI PETE GLOVER AT THE HARDWARE STORE BOUGHT NIPPEWA STOCK AT THIRTEEN CENTS AND SOLD IT TO HIS BROTHER AT SEVENTEEN AND BOUGHT IT BACK IN LESS THAN A WEEK AT NINETEEN THEY DIDN'T CARE THEY TOOK A CHANCE
460-172359-0037 JUDGE PEPPERLEIGH PUT THE REST OF HIS WIFE'S MONEY INTO TEMISKAMING COMMON AND LAWYER MACARTNEY GOT THE FEVER TOO AND PUT EVERY CENT THAT HIS SISTER POSSESSED INTO TULIP PREFERRED AND EVEN WHEN YOUNG FIZZLECHIP SHOT HIMSELF IN THE BACK ROOM OF THE MARIPOSA HOUSE MISTER GINGHAM BURIED HIM IN A CASKET WITH SILVER HANDLES
460-172359-0039 BUT JEFF THORPE WAS IN THE MINING BOOM RIGHT FROM THE START HE BOUGHT IN ON THE NIPPEWA MINE EVEN BEFORE THE INTERIM PROSPECTUS WAS OUT
460-172359-0040 AND HE AND JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLEKEEPER NEXT DOOR FORMED A SYNDICATE
460-172359-0042 BLUE ONES PINK ONES GREEN ONES WITH OUTLANDISH AND FASCINATING NAMES ON THEM THAT RAN CLEAR FROM THE MATTAWA TO THE HUDSON BAY AND RIGHT FROM THE START HE WAS CONFIDENT OF WINNING THERE AIN'T NO DIFFICULTY TO IT HE SAID
460-172359-0043 I DON'T SAY HE USED TO CONTINUE WITH THE SCISSORS OPEN AND READY TO CUT
460-172359-0045 TO AN ONLOOKER IT CERTAINLY DIDN'T SEEM SO SIMPLE I NEVER KNEW THE MEANNESS THE TRICKERY OF THE MINING BUSINESS THE SHEER OBSTINATE DETERMINATION OF THE BIGGER CAPITALISTS NOT TO MAKE MONEY WHEN THEY MIGHT TILL I HEARD THE ACCOUNTS OF JEFF'S DIFFERENT MINES TAKE THE CASE OF CORONA JEWEL
460-172359-0046 THERE WAS A GOOD MINE SIMPLY GOING TO RUIN FOR LACK OF COMMON SENSE SHE AIN'T BEEN DEVELOPED JEFF WOULD SAY THERE'S SILVER ENOUGH IN HER SO YOU COULD DIG IT OUT WITH A SHOVEL SHE'S FULL OF IT BUT THEY WON'T GET AT HER AND WORK HER
460-172359-0048 UTTER LACK OF ENGINEERING SKILL WAS ALL THAT WAS KEEPING THE SILENT PINE FROM MAKING A FORTUNE FOR ITS HOLDERS THE ONLY TROUBLE WITH THAT MINE SAID JEFF IS THEY WON'T GO DEEP ENOUGH
460-172359-0049 IF THEY'D JUST GO RIGHT INTO HER GOOD THEY'D GET IT AGAIN SHE'S DOWN THERE ALL RIGHT BUT PERHAPS THE MEANEST CASE OF ALL WAS THE NORTHERN STAR THAT ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME EVERY TIME I HEARD OF IT A STRAIGHT CASE FOR THE CRIMINAL LAW THE THING WAS SO EVIDENTLY A CONSPIRACY
460-172359-0051 AND I HELD ON TO HER AND THEY SHOVED HER DOWN TO TWENTY ONE THIS MORNING THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO SIXTEEN BUT I DON'T MEAN TO LET GO NO SIR IN ANOTHER FORTNIGHT THEY SHOVED HER THE SAME UNSCRUPULOUS CROWD DOWN TO NINE CENTS AND JEFFERSON STILL HELD ON
460-172359-0052 A FEW DAYS AFTER THAT THE SAME CRIMINAL GANG HAD HER DOWN FURTHER THAN EVER THEY'VE GOT HER DOWN TO THREE CENTS SAID JEFF BUT I'M WITH HER YES SIR THEY THINK THEY CAN SHOVE HER CLEAN OFF THE MARKET BUT THEY CAN'T DO IT I'VE BOUGHTEN IN JOHNSON'S SHARES
460-172359-0054 AND THAT THE STOCK HAD JUMPED TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS A SHARE AND EVEN AT THAT YOU COULDN'T GET IT AND JEFF STOOD THERE FLUSHED AND HALF STAGGERED AGAINST THE MIRROR OF THE LITTLE SHOP WITH A BUNCH OF MINING SCRIP IN HIS HAND THAT WAS WORTH FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS
460-172359-0055 EXCITEMENT IT WAS ALL OVER THE TOWN IN A MINUTES
460-172359-0057 AND PEOPLE WERE JUST CLUTCHING FOR THEM THEN AT NIGHT THERE WAS A BIG OYSTER SUPPER IN SMITH'S CAFF WITH SPEECHES AND THE MARIPOSA BAND OUTSIDE AND THE QUEER THING WAS THAT THE VERY NEXT AFTERNOON WAS THE FUNERAL OF YOUNG FIZZLECHIP
460-172359-0058 A PERFECT ILIAD WHILE HE WAS CLINGING TO HER THE WHOLE THING WAS IN THE CITY PAPERS A FEW DAYS AFTER WITH A PHOTOGRAPH OF JEFF TAKEN SPECIALLY AT ED MOORE'S STUDIO UPSTAIRS OVER NETLEY'S IT SHOWED JEFF SITTING AMONG PALM TREES AS ALL MINING MEN DO
460-172359-0060 THAT UNLESS YOU HEAR ABOUT THEM SEPARATELY AND ONE BY ONE YOU CAN'T FOR A MOMENT UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKE
460-172359-0061 ON HER HIGH STOOL WITH A STEEL CAP ON JABBING THE CONNECTING PLUGS IN AND OUT AS IF ELECTRICITY COST NOTHING WELL
460-172359-0063 HE'D HAVE HAD HER ARRESTED FOR ASSAULT MIND YOU I DON'T MEAN THAT MYRA WAS MERELY FLIPPANT AND WORTHLESS NOT AT ALL SHE WAS A GIRL WITH ANY AMOUNT OF TALENT YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HER RECITE THE RAVEN AT THE METHODIST SOCIAL SIMPLY GENIUS
460-172359-0064 AND WHEN SHE ACTED PORTIA IN THE TRIAL SCENE OF THE MERCHANT OF VENICE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL CONCERT
460-172359-0066 AND BECOME A LEADING ACTRESS BUT AS I SAID THE PUBLIC RECOGNITION COUNTED A LOT FOR JEFF THE MOMENT YOU BEGIN TO GET THAT SORT OF THING IT COMES IN QUICKLY ENOUGH BRAINS YOU KNOW ARE RECOGNIZED RIGHT AWAY THAT WAS WHY OF COURSE WITHIN A WEEK FROM THIS
460-172359-0067 JEFF RECEIVED THE FIRST BIG PACKET OF STUFF FROM THE CUBAN LAND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY WITH COLOURED PICTURES OF CUBA AND FIELDS OF BANANAS AND HACIENDAS AND INSURRECTOS WITH MACHETES AND HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT THEY HEARD OF HIM SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FOR A MODEST MAN LIKE JEFFERSON TO SAY HOW
460-172359-0069 AND THAT TOUCHES YOU NO THEY ASKED NO GUARANTEE JUST SEND THE MONEY WHETHER BY EXPRESS ORDER OR BY BANK DRAFT OR CHEQUE THEY LEFT THAT ENTIRELY TO ONESELF AS A MATTER BETWEEN CUBAN GENTLEMEN AND THEY WERE QUITE FRANK ABOUT THEIR ENTERPRISE
460-172359-0070 BANANAS AND TOBACCO IN THE PLANTATION DISTRICT RECLAIMED FROM THE INSURRECTOS YOU COULD SEE IT ALL THERE IN THE PICTURES
460-172359-0072 I LIKED IT ABOUT JEFF THAT HE DIDN'T STOP SHAVING HE WENT ON JUST THE SAME EVEN WHEN JOHNSON THE LIVERY STABLE MAN CAME IN WITH FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND ASKED HIM TO SEE IF THE CUBAN BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD LET HIM PUT IT IN JEFF LAID IT IN THE DRAWER AND THEN SHAVED HIM FOR FIVE CENTS IN THE SAME OLD WAY
460-172359-0073 A FEW DAYS LATER HE GOT A LETTER FROM THE CUBAN PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK ACCEPTING THE MONEY STRAIGHT OFF WITHOUT A SINGLE QUESTION AND WITHOUT KNOWING ANYTHING MORE OF JOHNSON EXCEPT THAT HE WAS A FRIEND OF JEFF'S THEY WROTE MOST HANDSOMELY ANY FRIENDS OF JEFF'S WERE FRIENDS OF CUBA
460-172359-0075 AND THAT SPREAD ROUND HIM A KIND OF HALO OF WEALTH AND MYSTERY AND OUTLANDISHNESS OH SOMETHING SPANISH PERHAPS YOU'VE FELT IT ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANYHOW THEY ASKED HIM ABOUT THE CLIMATE AND YELLOW FEVER AND WHAT THE NEGROES WERE LIKE AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING
460-172359-0076 AND FOR FRUIT THEY SAY IT COMES UP SO FAST YOU CAN'T STOP IT AND THEN HE WOULD PASS INTO DETAILS ABOUT THE HASH ENDERS AND THE RESURRECTOS AND TECHNICAL THINGS LIKE THAT TILL IT WAS THOUGHT A WONDER HOW HE COULD KNOW IT STILL IT WAS REALIZED THAT A MAN WITH MONEY HAS GOT TO KNOW THESE THINGS
460-172359-0078 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS GETTING SO MUCH MONEY WELL YOU KNOW THE WAY IT ACTS ON PEOPLE IN THE LARGER CITIES IT SEEMED TO SPOIL ONE'S IDEA OF JEFF THAT COPPER AND ASBESTOS AND BANANA LANDS SHOULD FORM THE GOAL OF HIS THOUGHT WHEN IF HE KNEW IT
460-172359-0079 IN FACT I HAD PERHAPS BORNE HIM A GRUDGE FOR WHAT SEEMED TO ME HIS PERPETUAL INTEREST IN THE GREAT CAPITALISTS HE ALWAYS HAD SOME ITEM OUT OF THE PAPER ABOUT THEM
460-172359-0081 YOU COULD SEE THE LIGHT OF THE LAMP BEHIND THE BLIND AND THROUGH THE SCREEN DOOR AS YOU CAME ALONG
460-172359-0082 THERE WAS A ROUND TABLE THAT THE WOMAN USED TO LAY FOR SUPPER
460-172359-0084 JEFF LAID DOWN WHAT HE WAS READING AND STARTED TO TALK ABOUT CARNEGIE THIS CARNEGIE I BET YOU WOULD BE WORTH SAID JEFF CLOSING UP HIS EYES IN CALCULATION AS MUCH AS PERHAPS TWO MILLION DOLLARS IF YOU WAS TO SELL HIM UP
460-172359-0085 I MAY SAY IN PARENTHESES THAT IT WAS A FAVOURITE METHOD IN MARIPOSA IF YOU WANTED TO GET AT THE REAL WORTH OF A MAN TO IMAGINE HIM CLEAN SOLD UP PUT UP FOR AUCTION AS IT WERE IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO TEST HIM AND NOW LOOK AT EM JEFF WENT ON
460-172359-0087 THERE WERE NO BOYS PRESENT BUT IN MARIPOSA ALL REALLY IMPORTANT SPEECHES ARE ADDRESSED TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE OF BOYS I TELL YOU IF I WAS TO MAKE A MILLION OUT OF THIS CUBEY I'D GIVE IT STRAIGHT TO THE POOR YES SIR DIVIDE IT UP INTO A HUNDRED LOTS OF A THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH AND GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT HADN'T NOTHING
460-172359-0088 SO ALWAYS AFTER THAT I KNEW JUST WHAT THOSE BANANAS WERE BEING GROWN FOR INDEED AFTER THAT THOUGH JEFFERSON NEVER SPOKE OF HIS INTENTIONS DIRECTLY HE SAID A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT SEEMED TO BEAR ON THEM
460-172359-0090 A FELLER COULD GET ENOUGH OF THEM TO MAKE A SHOWING
460-172359-0091 BUT STILL WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING OF WHAT JEFF MEANT TO DO NOBODY KNOWS OR CARES ABOUT IT NOW THE END OF IT WAS BOUND TO COME EVEN IN MARIPOSA SOME OF THE PEOPLE MUST HAVE THOUGHT SO
460-172359-0093 AND YET WHEN IT CAME IT SEEMED SO QUIET EVER SO QUIET NOT A BIT LIKE THE NORTHERN STAR MINE AND THE OYSTER SUPPER AND THE MARIPOSA BAND IT IS STRANGE HOW QUIET THESE THINGS LOOK THE OTHER WAY ROUND
460-172359-0094 YOU REMEMBER THE CUBAN LAND FRAUDS IN NEW YORK AND PORFORIO GOMEZ SHOOTING THE DETECTIVE AND HIM AND MAXIMO MOREZ GETTING CLEAR AWAY WITH TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NO OF COURSE YOU DON'T WHY EVEN IN THE CITY PAPERS IT ONLY FILLED AN INCH OR TWO OF TYPE AND ANYWAY THE NAMES WERE HARD TO REMEMBER
460-172359-0096 AND JEFF WENT BACK TO THE SHOP SO QUIET HAVE YOU EVER SEEN AN ANIMAL THAT IS STRICKEN THROUGH HOW QUIET IT SEEMS TO MOVE
460-172359-0097 AND SINCE THAT THOUGH IT'S QUITE A LITTLE WHILE AGO THE SHOP'S OPEN TILL ELEVEN EVERY NIGHT NOW AND JEFF IS SHAVING AWAY TO PAY BACK THAT FIVE HUNDRED THAT JOHNSON THE LIVERY MAN SENT TO THE CUBANS AND PATHETIC TUT TUT YOU DON'T KNOW MARIPOSA
460-172359-0099 THEY WERE GLAD ENOUGH TO GET HER AND SHE SAYS NOW THAT IF THERE'S ONE THING SHE HATES IT'S THE STAGE AND SHE CAN'T SEE HOW THE ACTRESSES PUT UP WITH IT ANYWAY THINGS ARE NOT SO BAD
481-123719-0000 IT WAS FOLLOWED BY REMORSE I TRIED TO DRIVE IT AWAY I FELT TOO SICK
481-123719-0002 I WAS A TERRIBLE DREAMER I WOULD DREAM FOR THREE MONTHS ON END TUCKED AWAY IN MY CORNER AND YOU MAY BELIEVE ME THAT AT THOSE MOMENTS I HAD NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE GENTLEMAN WHO IN THE PERTURBATION OF HIS CHICKEN HEART
481-123719-0003 PUT A COLLAR OF GERMAN BEAVER ON HIS GREAT COAT I SUDDENLY BECAME A HERO I WOULD NOT HAVE ADMITTED MY SIX FOOT LIEUTENANT EVEN IF HE HAD CALLED ON ME
481-123719-0005 THOUGH INDEED EVEN NOW I AM TO SOME EXTENT SATISFIED WITH THEM DREAMS WERE PARTICULARLY SWEET AND VIVID AFTER A SPELL OF DISSIPATION
481-123719-0006 THERE WERE MOMENTS OF SUCH POSITIVE INTOXICATION OF SUCH HAPPINESS THAT THERE WAS NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF IRONY WITHIN ME ON MY HONOUR I HAD FAITH HOPE LOVE I BELIEVED BLINDLY AT SUCH TIMES THAT BY SOME MIRACLE
481-123719-0008 BUT THE GREAT THING WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE ALL READY FOR ME WOULD RISE UP BEFORE ME AND I SHOULD COME OUT INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY ALMOST RIDING A WHITE HORSE AND CROWNED WITH LAUREL ANYTHING BUT THE FOREMOST PLACE I COULD NOT CONCEIVE FOR MYSELF
481-123719-0009 AND FOR THAT VERY REASON I QUITE CONTENTEDLY OCCUPIED THE LOWEST IN REALITY EITHER TO BE A HERO OR TO GROVEL IN THE MUD THERE WAS NOTHING BETWEEN
481-123719-0011 IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT THESE ATTACKS OF THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL VISITED ME EVEN DURING THE PERIOD OF DISSIPATION AND JUST AT THE TIMES WHEN I WAS TOUCHING THE BOTTOM THEY CAME IN SEPARATE SPURTS AS THOUGH REMINDING ME OF THEMSELVES
481-123719-0012 BUT DID NOT BANISH THE DISSIPATION BY THEIR APPEARANCE ON THE CONTRARY
481-123719-0014 EVEN A SIGNIFICANCE TO MY DISSIPATION IN FACT COMPLETELY ANSWERED THE PURPOSE OF AN APPETISING SAUCE THERE WAS A CERTAIN DEPTH OF MEANING IN IT AND I COULD HARDLY HAVE RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE SIMPLE VULGAR DIRECT DEBAUCHERY OF A CLERK
481-123719-0015 AND HAVE ENDURED ALL THE FILTHINESS OF IT
481-123719-0017 IN THOSE FLIGHTS INTO THE SUBLIME AND THE BEAUTIFUL THOUGH IT WAS FANTASTIC LOVE THOUGH IT WAS NEVER APPLIED TO ANYTHING HUMAN IN REALITY YET THERE WAS SO MUCH OF THIS LOVE THAT ONE DID NOT FEEL AFTERWARDS EVEN THE IMPULSE TO APPLY IT IN REALITY
481-123719-0018 EVERYTHING HOWEVER PASSED SATISFACTORILY BY A LAZY AND FASCINATING TRANSITION INTO THE SPHERE OF ART THAT IS INTO THE BEAUTIFUL FORMS OF LIFE LYING READY
481-123719-0020 MUCH THAT WAS SUBLIME AND BEAUTIFUL SOMETHING IN THE MANFRED STYLE EVERYONE WOULD KISS ME AND WEEP
481-123719-0021 AUSTERLITZ AGAINST THE OBSCURANTISTS THEN THE BAND WOULD PLAY A MARCH AN AMNESTY WOULD BE DECLARED THE POPE WOULD AGREE TO RETIRE FROM ROME TO BRAZIL
481-123719-0023 BUT WHY IS IT CONTEMPTIBLE CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I AM ASHAMED OF IT ALL AND THAT IT WAS STUPIDER THAN ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE GENTLEMEN AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT SOME OF THESE FANCIES WERE BY NO MEANS BADLY COMPOSED
481-123719-0024 AND YET YOU ARE RIGHT IT REALLY IS VULGAR AND CONTEMPTIBLE
481-123719-0026 I COULD NEVER STAND MORE THAN THREE MONTHS OF DREAMING AT A TIME WITHOUT FEELING AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY TO PLUNGE INTO SOCIETY MEANT
481-123719-0027 TO VISIT MY SUPERIOR AT THE OFFICE ANTON ANTONITCH SYETOTCHKIN HE WAS THE ONLY PERMANENT ACQUAINTANCE I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE
481-123719-0029 HIS AT HOME DAY SO I HAD ALWAYS TO TIME MY PASSIONATE DESIRE TO EMBRACE HUMANITY SO THAT IT MIGHT FALL ON A TUESDAY THIS ANTON ANTONITCH LIVED ON THE FOURTH STOREY IN A HOUSE IN FIVE CORNERS IN FOUR LOW PITCHED ROOMS
481-123719-0030 ONE SMALLER THAN THE OTHER OF A PARTICULARLY FRUGAL AND SALLOW APPEARANCE HE HAD TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEIR AUNT WHO USED TO POUR OUT THE TEA OF THE DAUGHTERS ONE WAS THIRTEEN AND ANOTHER FOURTEEN
481-123719-0032 USUALLY A COLLEAGUE FROM OUR OFFICE OR SOME OTHER DEPARTMENT I NEVER SAW MORE THAN TWO OR THREE VISITORS THERE ALWAYS THE SAME THEY TALKED ABOUT THE EXCISE DUTY
481-123719-0033 AND THE BEST MEANS OF PLEASING HIM AND SO ON I HAD THE PATIENCE TO SIT LIKE A FOOL BESIDE THESE PEOPLE
481-123719-0035 ON RETURNING HOME I DEFERRED FOR A TIME MY DESIRE TO EMBRACE ALL MANKIND I HAD HOWEVER ONE OTHER ACQUAINTANCE OF A SORT SIMONOV WHO WAS AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW I HAD A NUMBER OF SCHOOLFELLOWS INDEED IN PETERSBURG
481-123719-0036 BUT I DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THEM AND HAD EVEN GIVEN UP NODDING TO THEM IN THE STREET I BELIEVE I HAD TRANSFERRED INTO THE DEPARTMENT I WAS IN SIMPLY TO AVOID THEIR COMPANY AND TO CUT OFF ALL CONNECTION WITH MY HATEFUL CHILDHOOD
481-123719-0038 WHO HAD IN NO WAY BEEN DISTINGUISHED AT SCHOOL WAS OF A QUIET AND EQUABLE DISPOSITION BUT I DISCOVERED IN HIM A CERTAIN INDEPENDENCE OF CHARACTER AND EVEN HONESTY I DON'T EVEN SUPPOSE THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY STUPID
481-123719-0039 BUT THESE HAD NOT LASTED LONG AND HAD SOMEHOW BEEN SUDDENLY CLOUDED OVER HE WAS EVIDENTLY UNCOMFORTABLE AT THESE REMINISCENCES AND WAS I FANCY ALWAYS AFRAID THAT I MIGHT TAKE UP THE SAME TONE AGAIN
481-123719-0041 BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENED THAT SUCH REFLECTIONS IMPELLED ME AS THOUGH PURPOSELY TO PUT MYSELF INTO A FALSE POSITION I WENT IN
481-123720-0000 ALL OF THEM TOOK SCARCELY ANY NOTICE OF MY ENTRANCE WHICH WAS STRANGE FOR I HAD NOT MET THEM FOR YEARS EVIDENTLY THEY LOOKED UPON ME AS SOMETHING ON THE LEVEL OF A COMMON FLY I HAD NOT BEEN TREATED LIKE THAT EVEN AT SCHOOL THOUGH THEY ALL HATED ME
481-123720-0002 BUT I HAD NOT EXPECTED SUCH CONTEMPT SIMONOV WAS POSITIVELY SURPRISED AT MY TURNING UP
481-123720-0003 ALL THIS DISCONCERTED ME I SAT DOWN FEELING RATHER MISERABLE AND BEGAN LISTENING TO WHAT THEY WERE SAYING THEY WERE ENGAGED IN WARM AND EARNEST CONVERSATION ABOUT A FAREWELL DINNER WHICH THEY WANTED TO ARRANGE FOR THE NEXT DAY TO A COMRADE OF THEIRS CALLED ZVERKOV
481-123720-0005 JUST BECAUSE HE WAS A PRETTY AND PLAYFUL BOY HE WAS ALWAYS BAD AT HIS LESSONS AND GOT WORSE AND WORSE AS HE WENT ON HOWEVER HE LEFT WITH A GOOD CERTIFICATE AS HE HAD POWERFUL INTERESTS DURING HIS LAST YEAR AT SCHOOL HE CAME IN FOR AN ESTATE OF TWO HUNDRED SERFS
481-123720-0006 AND AS ALMOST ALL OF US WERE POOR HE TOOK UP A SWAGGERING TONE AMONG US HE WAS VULGAR IN THE EXTREME BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS A GOOD NATURED FELLOW EVEN IN HIS SWAGGERING
481-123720-0008 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE HAD BEEN FAVOURED BY THE GIFTS OF NATURE MOREOVER IT WAS AS IT WERE AN ACCEPTED IDEA AMONG US THAT ZVERKOV WAS A SPECIALIST IN REGARD TO TACT AND THE SOCIAL GRACES THIS LAST FACT PARTICULARLY INFURIATED ME
481-123720-0009 I HATED THE ABRUPT SELF CONFIDENT TONE OF HIS VOICE HIS ADMIRATION OF HIS OWN WITTICISMS
481-123720-0011 I HATED THE WAY IN WHICH HE USED TO TALK OF HIS FUTURE CONQUESTS OF WOMEN HE DID NOT VENTURE TO BEGIN HIS ATTACK UPON WOMEN UNTIL HE HAD THE EPAULETTES OF AN OFFICER AND WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM WITH IMPATIENCE AND BOASTED OF THE DUELS HE WOULD CONSTANTLY BE FIGHTING
481-123720-0012 I REMEMBER HOW I INVARIABLY SO TACITURN SUDDENLY FASTENED UPON ZVERKOV WHEN ONE DAY TALKING AT A LEISURE MOMENT WITH HIS SCHOOLFELLOWS OF HIS FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE FAIR SEX AND GROWING AS SPORTIVE AS A PUPPY IN THE SUN
481-123720-0014 AND THAT IF THE PEASANTS DARED TO PROTEST HE WOULD HAVE THEM ALL FLOGGED AND DOUBLE THE TAX ON THEM THE BEARDED RASCALS OUR SERVILE RABBLE APPLAUDED BUT I ATTACKED HIM NOT FROM COMPASSION FOR THE GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS
481-123720-0015 BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY WERE APPLAUDING SUCH AN INSECT I GOT THE BETTER OF HIM ON THAT OCCASION BUT THOUGH ZVERKOV WAS STUPID HE WAS LIVELY AND IMPUDENT AND SO LAUGHED IT OFF AND IN SUCH A WAY THAT MY VICTORY WAS NOT REALLY COMPLETE
481-123720-0017 I DID NOT REBUFF THEM FOR I WAS FLATTERED BUT WE SOON PARTED AND QUITE NATURALLY AFTERWARDS I HEARD OF HIS BARRACK ROOM SUCCESS AS A LIEUTENANT AND OF THE FAST LIFE HE WAS LEADING THEN THERE CAME OTHER RUMOURS
481-123720-0018 BY THEN HE HAD TAKEN TO CUTTING ME IN THE STREET AND I SUSPECTED THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF COMPROMISING HIMSELF BY GREETING A PERSONAGE AS INSIGNIFICANT AS ME I SAW HIM ONCE IN THE THEATRE IN THE THIRD TIER OF BOXES
481-123720-0020 ONE COULD SEE THAT BY THE TIME HE WAS THIRTY HE WOULD BE CORPULENT
481-123720-0021 THEY HAD KEPT UP WITH HIM FOR THOSE THREE YEARS THOUGH PRIVATELY THEY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES ON AN EQUAL FOOTING WITH HIM I AM CONVINCED OF THAT OF SIMONOV'S TWO VISITORS ONE WAS FERFITCHKIN A RUSSIANISED GERMAN
481-123720-0023 OF PERSONAL HONOUR THOUGH OF COURSE HE WAS A WRETCHED LITTLE COWARD AT HEART HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WORSHIPPERS OF ZVERKOV WHO MADE UP TO THE LATTER FROM INTERESTED MOTIVES AND OFTEN BORROWED MONEY FROM HIM SIMONOV'S OTHER VISITOR TRUDOLYUBOV WAS A PERSON IN NO WAY REMARKABLE
481-123720-0024 A TALL YOUNG FELLOW IN THE ARMY WITH A COLD FACE FAIRLY HONEST THOUGH HE WORSHIPPED SUCCESS OF EVERY SORT AND WAS ONLY CAPABLE OF THINKING OF PROMOTION HE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTANT RELATION OF ZVERKOV'S AND THIS
481-123720-0026 WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD DINNER ZVERKOV OF COURSE WON'T PAY OF COURSE NOT SINCE WE ARE INVITING HIM SIMONOV DECIDED CAN YOU IMAGINE FERFITCHKIN INTERRUPTED HOTLY AND CONCEITEDLY
481-123720-0027 LIKE SOME INSOLENT FLUNKEY BOASTING OF HIS MASTER THE GENERAL'S DECORATIONS CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT ZVERKOV WILL LET US PAY ALONE HE WILL ACCEPT FROM DELICACY
481-123720-0029 SIMONOV WHO HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS CONCLUDED FINALLY HOW TWENTY ONE ROUBLES I ASKED IN SOME AGITATION WITH A SHOW OF BEING OFFENDED
481-123720-0030 TWENTY EIGHT ROUBLES IT SEEMED TO ME THAT TO INVITE MYSELF SO SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY WOULD BE POSITIVELY GRACEFUL AND THAT THEY WOULD ALL BE CONQUERED AT ONCE
481-123720-0032 I AM AN OLD SCHOOLFELLOW OF HIS TOO I BELIEVE AND I MUST OWN I FEEL HURT THAT YOU HAVE LEFT ME OUT I SAID BOILING OVER AGAIN AND WHERE WERE WE TO FIND YOU FERFITCHKIN PUT IN ROUGHLY YOU NEVER WERE ON GOOD TERMS WITH ZVERKOV TRUDOLYUBOV ADDED FROWNING
481-123720-0033 BUT I HAD ALREADY CLUTCHED AT THE IDEA AND WOULD NOT GIVE IT UP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NO ONE HAS A RIGHT TO FORM AN OPINION UPON THAT I RETORTED IN A SHAKING VOICE AS THOUGH SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED PERHAPS THAT IS JUST MY REASON FOR WISHING IT NOW
481-123720-0035 WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY FERFITCHKIN BEGAN IN AN UNDERTONE INDICATING ME TO SIMONOV BUT HE BROKE OFF FOR EVEN SIMONOV WAS EMBARRASSED THAT WILL DO SAID TRUDOLYUBOV GETTING UP IF HE WANTS TO COME SO MUCH LET HIM
481-123720-0036 BUT IT'S A PRIVATE THING BETWEEN US FRIENDS FERFITCHKIN SAID CROSSLY AS HE TOO PICKED UP HIS HAT IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL GATHERING WE DO NOT WANT AT ALL PERHAPS THEY WENT AWAY FERFITCHKIN DID NOT GREET ME IN ANY WAY AS HE WENT OUT
481-123720-0038 WILL YOU PAY YOUR SUBSCRIPTION NOW I JUST ASK SO AS TO KNOW HE MUTTERED IN EMBARRASSMENT I FLUSHED CRIMSON AS I DID SO I REMEMBERED THAT I HAD OWED SIMONOV FIFTEEN ROUBLES FOR AGES
481-123720-0039 WHICH I HAD INDEED NEVER FORGOTTEN THOUGH I HAD NOT PAID IT
481-123720-0041 AM I KEEPING YOU I ASKED AFTER TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE
481-123720-0042 THAT IS TO BE TRUTHFUL YES I HAVE TO GO AND SEE SOMEONE NOT FAR FROM HERE
481-123720-0044 IT'S CLOSE BY NOT TWO PACES AWAY SIMONOV REPEATED ACCOMPANYING ME TO THE FRONT DOOR WITH A FUSSY AIR WHICH DID NOT SUIT HIM AT ALL
481-123720-0045 HE WAS VERY GLAD TO GET RID OF ME I WAS IN A FURY WHAT POSSESSED ME WHAT POSSESSED ME TO FORCE MYSELF UPON THEM I WONDERED GRINDING MY TEETH AS I STRODE ALONG THE STREET FOR A SCOUNDREL A PIG LIKE THAT ZVERKOV OF COURSE
481-123720-0047 BUT WHAT MADE ME FURIOUS WAS THAT I KNEW FOR CERTAIN THAT I SHOULD GO THAT I SHOULD MAKE A POINT OF GOING AND THE MORE TACTLESS THE MORE UNSEEMLY MY GOING WOULD BE THE MORE CERTAINLY I WOULD GO AND THERE WAS A POSITIVE OBSTACLE TO MY GOING
481-123720-0048 I HAD NO MONEY ALL I HAD WAS NINE ROUBLES I HAD TO GIVE SEVEN OF THAT TO MY SERVANT APOLLON FOR HIS MONTHLY WAGES THAT WAS ALL I PAID HIM HE HAD TO KEEP HIMSELF
481-123720-0050 I WAS SENT TO THE SCHOOL BY DISTANT RELATIONS UPON WHOM I WAS DEPENDENT AND OF WHOM I HAVE HEARD NOTHING SINCE THEY SENT ME THERE A FORLORN SILENT BOY ALREADY CRUSHED BY THEIR REPROACHES ALREADY TROUBLED BY DOUBT
481-123720-0051 AND LOOKING WITH SAVAGE DISTRUST AT EVERYONE MY SCHOOLFELLOWS MET ME WITH SPITEFUL AND MERCILESS JIBES BECAUSE I WAS NOT LIKE ANY OF THEM BUT I COULD NOT ENDURE THEIR TAUNTS
481-123720-0053 THEIR COARSENESS REVOLTED ME THEY LAUGHED CYNICALLY AT MY FACE AT MY CLUMSY FIGURE AND YET WHAT STUPID FACES THEY HAD THEMSELVES IN OUR SCHOOL THE BOYS FACES SEEMED IN A SPECIAL WAY TO DEGENERATE AND GROW STUPIDER
481-123720-0054 HOW MANY FINE LOOKING BOYS CAME TO US IN A FEW YEARS THEY BECAME REPULSIVE EVEN AT SIXTEEN I WONDERED AT THEM MOROSELY EVEN THEN I WAS STRUCK BY THE PETTINESS OF THEIR THOUGHTS THE STUPIDITY OF THEIR PURSUITS
481-123720-0056 IT WAS NOT WOUNDED VANITY THAT DROVE ME TO IT AND FOR GOD'S SAKE DO NOT THRUST UPON ME YOUR HACKNEYED REMARKS REPEATED TO NAUSEA THAT I WAS ONLY A DREAMER WHILE THEY EVEN THEN HAD AN UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE
481-123720-0057 THEY TOOK RANK FOR INTELLIGENCE EVEN AT SIXTEEN THEY WERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT A SNUG BERTH OF COURSE A GREAT DEAL OF IT WAS DUE TO THEIR STUPIDITY TO THE BAD EXAMPLES WITH WHICH THEY HAD ALWAYS BEEN SURROUNDED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD AND BOYHOOD
481-123720-0059 AND SHOWED ITSELF IN A CERTAIN RAKISHNESS I HATED THEM HORRIBLY THOUGH PERHAPS I WAS WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM THEY REPAID ME IN THE SAME WAY AND DID NOT CONCEAL THEIR AVERSION FOR ME BUT BY THEN I DID NOT DESIRE THEIR AFFECTION
481-123720-0060 ON THE CONTRARY I CONTINUALLY LONGED FOR THEIR HUMILIATION TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR DERISION I PURPOSELY BEGAN TO MAKE ALL THE PROGRESS I COULD WITH MY STUDIES AND FORCED MY WAY TO THE VERY TOP THIS IMPRESSED THEM
481-123720-0062 BUT WERE MORALLY IMPRESSED ESPECIALLY AS THE TEACHERS BEGAN TO NOTICE ME ON THOSE GROUNDS THE MOCKERY CEASED BUT THE HOSTILITY REMAINED AND COLD AND STRAINED RELATIONS BECAME PERMANENT BETWEEN US IN THE END I COULD NOT PUT UP WITH IT
481-123720-0063 WITH YEARS A CRAVING FOR SOCIETY FOR FRIENDS DEVELOPED IN ME I ATTEMPTED TO GET ON FRIENDLY TERMS WITH SOME OF MY SCHOOLFELLOWS BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER MY INTIMACY WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS STRAINED AND SOON ENDED OF ITSELF
481-123720-0065 AND REPULSED HIM AS THOUGH ALL I NEEDED HIM FOR WAS TO WIN A VICTORY OVER HIM TO SUBJUGATE HIM AND NOTHING ELSE BUT I COULD NOT SUBJUGATE ALL OF THEM MY FRIEND WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE THEM EITHER HE WAS IN FACT A RARE EXCEPTION
481-123720-0066 THE FIRST THING I DID ON LEAVING SCHOOL WAS TO GIVE UP THE SPECIAL JOB FOR WHICH I HAD BEEN DESTINED SO AS TO BREAK ALL TIES
481-123720-0068 BUT I BELIEVED THAT SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WAS COMING AND WOULD INEVITABLY COME THAT DAY OWING TO ITS RARITY PERHAPS ANY EXTERNAL EVENT HOWEVER TRIVIAL ALWAYS MADE ME FEEL AS THOUGH SOME RADICAL CHANGE IN MY LIFE WERE AT HAND
481-123720-0069 I WENT TO THE OFFICE HOWEVER AS USUAL BUT SNEAKED AWAY HOME TWO HOURS EARLIER TO GET READY THE GREAT THING I THOUGHT IS NOT TO BE THE FIRST TO ARRIVE OR THEY WILL THINK I AM OVERJOYED AT COMING BUT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF SUCH
481-123720-0071 I STOLE THE BRUSHES TO CLEAN THEM FROM THE PASSAGE BEING CAREFUL HE SHOULD NOT DETECT IT FOR FEAR OF HIS CONTEMPT
481-123720-0072 I HAD LET MYSELF GET TOO SLOVENLY MY UNIFORM PERHAPS WAS TIDY BUT I COULD NOT GO OUT TO DINNER IN MY UNIFORM THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT ON THE KNEE OF MY TROUSERS WAS A BIG YELLOW STAIN
481-123720-0074 I KNEW TOO PERFECTLY WELL EVEN THEN THAT I WAS MONSTROUSLY EXAGGERATING THE FACTS BUT HOW COULD I HELP IT
481-123720-0075 WITH DESPAIR I PICTURED TO MYSELF HOW COLDLY AND DISDAINFULLY THAT SCOUNDREL ZVERKOV WOULD MEET ME
481-123720-0077 AND WORST OF ALL HOW PALTRY UNLITERARY COMMONPLACE IT WOULD ALL BE
481-123720-0078 BUT THAT WAS MOST IMPOSSIBLE OF ALL IF I FEEL IMPELLED TO DO ANYTHING I SEEM TO BE PITCHFORKED INTO IT I SHOULD HAVE JEERED AT MYSELF EVER AFTERWARDS SO YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED IT YOU FUNKED THE REAL THING
481-123720-0080 OF DOMINATING THEM CARRYING THEM AWAY MAKING THEM LIKE ME IF ONLY FOR MY ELEVATION OF THOUGHT AND UNMISTAKABLE WIT THEY WOULD ABANDON ZVERKOV HE WOULD SIT ON ONE SIDE SILENT AND ASHAMED WHILE I SHOULD CRUSH HIM THEN PERHAPS
481-123720-0081 WE WOULD BE RECONCILED AND DRINK TO OUR EVERLASTING FRIENDSHIP BUT WHAT WAS MOST BITTER AND HUMILIATING FOR ME WAS THAT I KNEW EVEN THEN KNEW FULLY AND FOR CERTAIN THAT I NEEDED NOTHING OF ALL THIS REALLY THAT I DID NOT REALLY WANT TO CRUSH
481-123720-0083 OH HOW I PRAYED FOR THE DAY TO PASS QUICKLY
481-123720-0084 OPENED THE MOVABLE PANE AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE TROUBLED DARKNESS OF THE THICKLY FALLING WET SNOW AT LAST MY WRETCHED LITTLE CLOCK HISSED OUT FIVE I SEIZED MY HAT AND TRYING NOT TO LOOK AT APOLLON
587-41611-0000 ALTHOUGH THE GIRLS BELONGING TO JULIA'S PARTY WERE SILENT CONCERNING WHAT HAPPENED AT THE OMNIBUS HOUSE THE STORY LEAKED OUT CREATING CONSIDERABLE DISCUSSION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE TWO UPPER CLASSES JULIA CROSBY HAD A SHREWD SUSPICION
587-41611-0001 THAT EDNA WRIGHT HAD BEEN THE ORIGINAL PURVEYOR OF THE NEWS AND IN THIS SHE WAS RIGHT EDNA HAD UNDER PLEDGE OF SECRECY TOLD IT TO A SOPHOMORE WHO IMMEDIATELY TOLD IT TO HER DEAREST FRIEND AND SO THE TALE TRAVELED UNTIL IT REACHED ELEANOR
587-41611-0003 FROM THE DAY THAT MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN HER TO TASK FOR ABSENCE SHE HAD ENTERTAINED A SUPREME CONTEMPT FOR THE PRINCIPAL OF WHICH MISS THOMPSON WAS WHOLLY UNAWARE UNTIL ENCOUNTERING ELEANOR ONE MORNING IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41611-0004 A DIRECT SLAP IN THE FACE COULD SCARCELY HAVE CONVEYED GREATER INSULT THAN DID THAT ONE INSOLENT GLANCE THE PRINCIPAL WAS AT A LOSS AS TO ITS IMPORT SHE WISELY DECIDED TO IGNORE IT BUT STORED IT UP IN HER MEMORY FOR FUTURE REFERENCE
587-41611-0006 AND WENT ABOUT MAKING MYSTERIOUS SIGNS TO EACH OTHER WHENEVER THEY MET THE VERY NAME OF THE SOCIETY WAS SHROUDED IN MYSTERY THOUGH NORA O'MALLEY WAS HEARD TO DECLARE THAT SHE HAD NO DOUBT IT WAS A BRANCH OF THE BLACK HAND
587-41611-0007 ELEANOR WAS THE ACKNOWLEDGED LEADER BUT EDNA WRIGHT BECAME A CLOSE SECOND AND BETWEEN THEM THEY MANAGED TO DISSEMINATE A SPIRIT OF MISCHIEF THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL THAT THE TEACHERS FOUND HARD TO COMBAT GRACE HARLOWE WATCHED THE TREND THAT AFFAIRS WERE TAKING WITH CONSIDERABLE ANXIETY
587-41611-0009 GRACE'S HEART WAS WITH HER CLASS SHE WISHED IT TO BE A CLASS AMONG CLASSES AND FELT AN ALMOST MOTHERLY ANXIETY FOR ITS SUCCESS WHAT DOES AIL SOME OF OUR CLASS SHE EXCLAIMED TO ANNE AND NORA ONE DAY AS THEY LEFT THE SCHOOL BUILDING
587-41611-0010 THEY SEEM POSSESSED WITH IMPS THE PHI SIGMA TAU GIRLS AND A FEW OF THE GRINDS ARE REALLY THE ONLY ONES WHO BEHAVE LATELY IT'S LARGELY DUE TO ELEANOR I THINK REPLIED ANNE SHE SEEMS TO HAVE BECOME QUITE A POWER AMONG SOME OF THE GIRLS IN THE CLASS
587-41611-0012 THE JUNIORS WILL GET THE REPUTATION AMONG THE TEACHERS THIS YEAR THAT THE JUNIOR CLASS HAD LAST AND IT SEEMS SUCH A PITY I OVERHEARD MISS CHESTER TELL MISS KANE THE OTHER DAY
587-41611-0013 THAT HER JUNIOR CLASSES WERE THE MOST TRYING OF THE DAY BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK HARDER TO MAINTAIN DISCIPLINE THAN TO TEACH HER SUBJECT THAT'S A NICE REPUTATION TO CARRY AROUND ISN'T IT REMARKED NORA INDIGNANTLY BUT ALL WE CAN DO IS TO TRY HARDER THAN EVER TO MAKE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY
587-41611-0015 THERE IS TALK OF GIVING A SHAKESPEARIAN PLAY WITH MISS TEBBS TO ENGINEER IT AND THE CAST TO BE CHOSEN FROM THE THREE LOWER CLASSES THE SENIORS OF COURSE WILL GIVE THEIR OWN PLAY LATER HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ASKED ANNE MISS THOMPSON HERSELF TOLD ME ABOUT IT REPLIED GRACE
587-41611-0016 I SHALL TRY AWFULLY HARD FOR A PART EVEN IF IT IS ONLY TWO LINES SAID ANNE EARNESTLY I WONDER WHAT PLAY IS TO BE CHOSEN AND IF IT IS TO BE GIVEN FOR THE SCHOOL ONLY
587-41611-0018 HOWEVER I'M NOT GOING TO BOTHER MUCH ABOUT THE PLAY NOW FOR THE SENIOR TEAM HAS JUST SENT ME A CHALLENGE TO PLAY THEM SATURDAY DECEMBER TWELFTH SO I'LL HAVE TO GET THE TEAM TOGETHER AND GO TO WORK WE'RE AWFULLY LATE THIS YEAR ABOUT STARTING DON'T YOU THINK SO ASKED NORA
587-41611-0019 YES ADMITTED GRACE I AM JUST AS ENTHUSIASTIC OVER BASKETBALL AS EVER ONLY I HAVEN'T HAD THE TIME TO DEVOTE TO IT THAT I DID LAST YEAR NEVER MIND YOU'LL MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME AFTER THANKSGIVING SAID ANNE SOOTHINGLY AS FOR ME I'M GOING TO DREAM ABOUT THE PLAY
587-41611-0021 IT IS WONDERFUL TO FEEL THAT ONE IS ABLE TO FORGET ONE'S SELF AND BECOME SOME ONE ELSE BUT IT IS MORE WONDERFUL TO MAKE ONE'S AUDIENCE FEEL IT TOO TO HAVE THEM FORGET THAT ONE IS ANYTHING EXCEPT THE LIVING BREATHING PERSON WHOSE CHARACTER ONE IS TRYING TO PORTRAY
587-41611-0022 I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SENSE OF POWER THAT ONE HAS OVER PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS THAT MAKES ACTING SO FASCINATING IT IS THE OTHER SIDE THAT I HATE SHE ADDED WITH A SLIGHT SHUDDER I SUPPOSE THEATRICAL PEOPLE DO UNDERGO MANY HARDSHIPS SAID GRACE
587-41611-0024 LIKE MAUD ADAMS OR ETHEL BARRYMORE THEN THAT IS DIFFERENT SHE IS PRACTICALLY BORN BRED AND BROUGHT UP IN THE THEATRE SHE IS AS CAREFULLY GUARDED AS THOUGH SHE LIVED IN A LITTLE VILLAGE SIMPLY BECAUSE SHE KNOWS FROM BABYHOOD ALL THE UNPLEASANT FEATURES OF THE PROFESSION
587-41611-0025 AND HOW TO AVOID THEM THERE IS SOME CHANCE OF HER BECOMING GREAT TOO OF COURSE REAL STARS DO APPEAR ONCE IN A WHILE WHO ARE TOO TALENTED TO BE KEPT DOWN HOWEVER THE REALLY GREAT ONES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN
587-41611-0027 SHE CERTAINLY WILL SAID NORA BUT TO GIVE THE PLAY A REST AND COME DOWN TO EVERYDAY AFFAIRS WHERE SHALL WE MEET TO GO TO THE FOOTBALL GAME LET ME SEE SAID GRACE THE GAME IS TO BE CALLED AT THREE O'CLOCK
587-41611-0028 I SUPPOSE WE SHALL ALL BE THROUGH DINNER BY HALF PAST TWO YOU HAD BETTER BRING YOUR GIRLS TO MY HOUSE EACH OF YOU IS TO HAVE TWO AND JESSICA HAS ONE BESIDES MABEL I AM TO HAVE THREE I FOUND ANOTHER YESTERDAY DAVID PROMISED TO GET ME THE TICKETS
587-41619-0000 WHO MADE AN ENTRY ON HER PAD AND BECKONED TO THE GIRL NEXT TO MARIAN TO COME FORWARD STRAIGHT DOWN THE LINE HE WENT SOMETIMES STOPPING A GIRL AT HER THIRD OR FOURTH LINE RARELY ALLOWING THEM TO READ FARTHER THAN THE ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH
587-41619-0001 NORA WAS THE SECOND PHI SIGMA TAU TO UNDERGO THE ORDEAL AS SHE BRISKLY DELIVERED THE OPENING LINES THE ACTOR STOPPED HER TAKING THE BOOK FROM HER HE TURNED TO THE PART WHERE TOUCHSTONE QUAINTLY HUMOROUS HOLDS FORTH UPON THE LIE SEVEN TIMES REMOVED
587-41619-0003 THEN HE AGAIN HELD CONVERSATION WITH MISS TEBBS WHO NODDED AND LOOKED SMILINGLY TOWARD NORA WHO STOOD SCOWLING FAINTLY RATHER ILL PLEASED AT ATTRACTING SO MUCH ATTENTION
587-41619-0004 WHISPERED JESSICA TO GRACE WHO WAS ABOUT TO REPLY WHEN MISTER SOUTHARD MOTIONED TO HER GRACE WHO KNEW THE SCENE BY HEART WENT FEARLESSLY FORWARD AND READ THE LINES WITH SPLENDID EMPHASIS MARIAN AND EVA ALLEN FOLLOWED HER
587-41619-0006 BEGAN THE READING OF THE DESIGNATED LINES HER VOICE SOUNDED UNUSUALLY CLEAR AND SWEET YET LACKED SOMETHING OF THE POWER OF EXPRESSION DISPLAYED BY GRACE IN HER RENDERING OF THE SAME SCENE WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED
587-41619-0007 SHE HANDED THE BOOK BACK WITH AN AIR OF STUDIED INDIFFERENCE SHE WAS FAR FROM FEELING SHE HAD DECIDED IN HER OWN MIND THAT ROSALIND WAS THE PART BEST SUITED TO HER AND FELT THAT THE HONOR NOW LAY BETWEEN HERSELF AND GRACE
587-41619-0009 THE GIRL WAS ANNE PIERSON WHO IN SOME MYSTERIOUS MANNER HAD BEEN ALL BUT OVERLOOKED UNTIL MISS TEBBS SPIED HER STANDING BETWEEN GRACE AND NORA CAN YOU SPARE US A MOMENT MORE MISTER SOUTHARD SAID MISS TEBBS TO THE ACTOR WHO WAS PREPARING TO LEAVE
587-41619-0010 JUST AS THAT TEACHER HAD OBSERVED HER AS MOST OF THE GIRLS PRESENT HAD HEARD ANNE RECITE
587-41619-0012 AND THE MOCK SERIOUS BANTERING TONES IN WHICH SHE DELIVERED ROSALIND'S WITTY SPEECHES CAUSED MISTER SOUTHARD TO SMILE AND NOD APPROVINGLY AS SHE GAVE FULL VALUE TO THE IMMORTAL LINES HER CHANGE OF VOICE FROM ROSALIND TO ORLANDO WAS WHOLLY DELIGHTFUL
587-41619-0013 AND SO CHARMINGLY DID SHE DEPICT BOTH CHARACTERS THAT WHEN SHE ENDED WITH ORLANDO'S EXIT SHE RECEIVED A LITTLE OVATION FROM THE LISTENING GIRLS IN WHICH MISTER SOUTHARD AND MISS TEBBS JOINED
587-41619-0015 I AM SURE ROSALIND WILL BE SAFE WITH YOU
587-41619-0016 IF I AM ANYWHERE NEAR HERE WHEN YOUR PLAY IS ENACTED I SHALL MAKE IT A POINT TO COME AND SEE IT SHAKING HANDS WARMLY WITH MISS TEBBS AND BOWING TO THE ADMIRING GIRLS MISTER SOUTHARD HURRIEDLY DEPARTED LEAVING HIS AUDIENCE DEVOURED WITH CURIOSITY AS TO THE CHOSEN ONES
587-41619-0018 BUT SHE WAS TOO OVERCOME TO THANK THEM AND SMILED AT THEM THROUGH A MIST OF TEARS LOOK AT ELEANOR WHISPERED NORA TO GRACE SHE'S SO ANGRY SHE CAN'T SEE STRAIGHT SHE MUST HAVE WANTED TO PLAY ROSALIND HERSELF
587-41619-0019 I TOLD YOU SHE'D SULK IF SHE COULDN'T BE THE LEADING LADY GRACE GLANCED OVER TOWARD ELEANOR WHO STOOD BITING HER LIP HER HANDS CLENCHED AND HER FACE SET IN ANGRY LINES SHE LOOKS LIKE THE VENDETTA OR THE CAMORRA
587-41619-0021 THEN STOPPED AND TURNING HER BACK UPON THE PHI SIGMA TAU BEGAN TALKING TO EDNA WRIGHT JUST THEN MISS TEBBS WHO HAD BEEN BUSY WITH HER LIST ANNOUNCED THAT SHE WOULD NOW NAME THE CAST AND ALL CONVERSATION CEASED AS BY MAGIC
587-41619-0022 MIRIAM NESBIT WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE DUKE WHILE MARIAN BARBER WAS TO PLAY FREDERICK HIS BROTHER JESSICA WAS IN RAPTURES OVER PHEBE WHILE NORA HAD CAPTURED TOUCHSTONE EVA ALLEN AUDREY AND TO HER GREAT DELIGHT
587-41619-0024 THERE GOES ELEANOR AFTER MISS TEBBS OBSERVED MARIAN BARBER WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE SHE'S UP TO NOW OH NEVER MIND HER SAID NORA IMPATIENTLY YOU'LL SEE ENOUGH OF HER DURING REHEARSAL IT WILL BE SO PLEASANT TO REHEARSE WITH HER
587-41619-0025 CONSIDERING THAT SHE ISN'T ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH ANY OF US HAD THE GIRL CHUMS KNOWN THEN WHAT ELEANOR WAS UP TO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MATTER OF SURPRISE AND INDIGNATION TO ALL OF THEM AFTER IMPERIOUSLY COMMANDING HER SATELLITES TO WAIT FOR HER IN THE CORRIDOR
587-41619-0027 AND YOU CAN WIN PLENTY OF APPLAUSE PLAYING IT YOU MUST UNDERSTAND HOWEVER THAT ONCE HAVING GIVEN OUT A PART I SHOULD NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE IT FROM THE GIRL I HAD GIVEN IT TO SIMPLY BECAUSE SOME OTHER GIRL DESIRED IT THAT WOULD BE BOTH UNFAIR AND UNJUST
587-41619-0028 STOOD AWAITING HER REPLY I SHOULD LIKE TO DO THAT ELEANOR SAID SLOWLY A CURIOUS LIGHT IN HER EYES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TEBBS
587-54108-0001 BY A VAGUE SOMETHING IN KEMP'S EYES THE FEELING HOWEVER HAD VANISHED GRADUALLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DOCTOR ALWAYS HAD A PECULIARLY INTENT GAZE AND MOREOVER NO ONE COULD HAVE HELPED APPRECIATING HER LOVELINESS THAT NIGHT
587-54108-0002 THIS OF ITSELF WILL BRING A SOFTNESS INTO A MAN'S MANNER AND WITHOUT DOUBT HIS FEARS HAD BEEN GROUNDLESS FEARS THAT HE HAD NOT DARED TO PUT INTO WORDS FOR OLD MAN AS HE WAS HE REALIZED THAT DOCTOR KEMP'S STRONG PERSONALITY
587-54108-0004 YET NOW AS HE RECOGNIZED HER COMPANION HIS MISGIVINGS RETURNED THREEFOLD THE COURTEOUS GENTLEMAN HOWEVER WAS AT HIS EASE AS THEY CAME UP THIS IS A SURPRISE DOCTOR HE EXCLAIMED CORDIALLY OPENING THE GATE AND EXTENDING HIS HAND
587-54108-0005 KEMP GRASPED HIS HAND HEARTILY I AM A SORT OF SURPRISE PARTY HE ANSWERED SWINGING ETHEL TO THE GROUND AND WATCHING HER SCAMPER OFF TO THE HOTEL AND WHAT IS MORE HE CONTINUED TURNING TO HIM I HAVE NOT BROUGHT A HAMPER WHICH MAKES ONE OF ME
587-54108-0007 HE PROTESTED AT SUCH A STUPENDOUS COMPARISON AND INSISTED THAT SHE MAKE CLEAR THAT THE DUMMY WAS NOT INCLUDED THE SHORT AFTERNOON GLIDED INTO EVENING AND DOCTOR KEMP WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL AND DINED AT THE LEVICES TABLE
587-54108-0008 RUTH IN A WHITE WOOL GOWN SAT OPPOSITE HIM IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD DINED WITH THEM AND HE ENJOYED A SINGULAR FEELING OVER THE SITUATION
587-54108-0010 THOUGH OF COURSE HE DID NOT SAY SO AS THEY STROLLED ABOUT AFTERWARD HE MANAGED TO KEEP HIS DAUGHTER WITH HIM AND ALLOWED KEMP TO APPROPRIATE HIS WIFE THEY FINALLY DRIFTED TO THE COTTAGE STEPS
587-54108-0011 AND WERE ENJOYING THE BEAUTY OF THE NIGHT WHEN WILL TYRRELL PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THEM GOOD EVENING HE SAID TAKING OFF HIS HAT AS HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STEPS
587-54108-0013 NOW WHEN HE DECIDEDLY OBJECTED TO MOVING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARTLESS NOT TO GO DON'T CONSIDER ME SAID THE DOCTOR OBSERVING HIS HESITANCY IF IT ILL RELIEVE YOU I ASSURE YOU I SHALL NOT MISS YOU IN THE LEAST GO RIGHT AHEAD JULES URGED HIS WIFE
587-54108-0014 RUTH AND I WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR IF SHE HAD PROMISED TO TAKE CARE OF RUTH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO HIS MIND BUT SINCE HIS WIFE WAS THERE WHAT HARM COULD ACCRUE THAT HIS PRESENCE WOULD PREVENT SO WITH A SINCERE APOLOGY HE WENT OVER TO THE HOTEL
587-54108-0016 WHO SWAYED TO AND FRO IN HER ROCKER HE WAS INTENTLY CONSCIOUS OF RUTH'S WHITE FIGURE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL
587-54108-0017 BUT SHE WAS RATHER STARTLED WHEN SHE PERCEIVED THAT KEMP WAS ADDRESSING HER I SHOULD LIKE TO SHOW MY PROWESS TO YOU MISS LEVICE IN WHAT SHE ASKED SOMEWHAT DAZED RUTH RUTH LAUGHED HER MOTHER
587-54108-0019 THAT AS IT IS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT THERE IS NOTHING TO PREVENT YOUR TAKING A LITTLE ROW AND THEN EACH CAN JUDGE OF THE OTHER'S CLAIM TO SUPERIORITY MY CLAIM HAS NEVER BEEN JUSTLY ESTABLISHED SAID RUTH I HAVE NEVER ALLOWED ANY ONE TO USURP MY OARS
587-54108-0020 AS YET CORRECTED KEMP THEN WILL YOU WRAP SOMETHING ABOUT YOU AND COME DOWN TO THE RIVER CERTAINLY SHE WILL ANSWERED HER MOTHER RUN IN AND GET SOME WRAPS RUTH YOU WILL COME TOO MAMMA OF COURSE BUT CONSIDERING DOCTOR KEMP'S LENGTH
587-54108-0022 IF DOCTOR KEMP WISHED TO ROW HE SHOULD ROW AND SINCE THE JEWISH MISSUS GRUNDY WAS NOT ON HAND ANYTHING HARMLESSLY ENJOYABLE WAS PERMISSIBLE RUTH WENT INDOORS THIS WAS CERTAINLY SOMETHING SHE HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR
587-54108-0023 HOW COULD HER MOTHER BE SO BLIND AS NOT TO KNOW OR FEEL HER DESIRE TO EVADE DOCTOR KEMP SHE FELT A POSITIVE CONTEMPT FOR HERSELF THAT HIS PRESENCE SHOULD AFFECT HER AS IT DID SHE DARED NOT LOOK AT HIM LEST HER HEART SHOULD FLUTTER TO HER EYES
587-54108-0025 SHE WOULD MEET AND ANSWER EVERY ONE OF HIS LONG GLANCES IN KIND SHE WOUND A BLACK LACE SHAWL AROUND HER HEAD AND WITH SOME WRAPS FOR HER MOTHER CAME OUT HADN'T YOU BETTER PUT SOMETHING OVER YOUR SHOULDERS HE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY AS SHE APPEARED
587-54108-0026 AND DISGUST THE NIGHT WITH LACK OF APPRECIATION SHE TURNED TO A CORNER OF THE PORCH AND LIFTED A PAIR OF OARS TO HER SHOULDER WHY HE SAID IN SURPRISE COMING TOWARD HER YOU KEEP YOUR OARS AT HOME ON THE PRINCIPLE OF NEITHER A BORROWER NOR A LENDER BE
587-54108-0028 HE GENTLY LIFTED HER RESISTING FINGERS ONE BY ONE AND RAISED THE BROAD BONE OF CONTENTION TO HIS SHOULDER
587-54108-0029 THE CRICKETS CHIRPED IN THE HEDGES NOW AND THEN A FIREFLY FLASHED BEFORE THEM
587-54108-0031 AS HE PUT ONE FOOT IN AFTER SHOVING IT OFF
587-54108-0032 IN THE BOW I DISLIKE TO SEE DANGERS BEFORE WE COME TO THEM HE HELPED HER CAREFULLY TO HER PLACE SHE THANKED HIM LAUGHINGLY FOR HIS EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG ARM AND HE TURNED TO RUTH I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO MOVE FROM MY PLACE SHE SAID IN DEFIANT MISCHIEF
587-54108-0034 YOU HAD BETTER SIT DOWN HE SAID MOTIONING TO THE ROWER'S SEAT AND YOU SHE ASKED I SHALL SIT BESIDE YOU AND USE THE OTHER OAR HE ANSWERED NONCHALANTLY SMILING DOWN AT HER WITH A HALF PLEASED FEELING OF DISCOMFITURE
587-54108-0035 THAT IS NO HINDRANCE TO MY VOLUBILITY I AM GLAD TO SAY A BACK IS NOT VERY INSPIRING OR EXPRESSIVE BUT RUTH CAN TELL ME WHEN YOU LOOK BORED IF I WAX TOO DISCURSIVE IT WAS A TINY BOAT
587-54108-0037 SHE COULD NOT FAIL TO NOTICE THE EASY MOTION OF HIS FIGURE AS HE ROWED LIGHTLY DOWN THE RIVER HIS FLANNEL SHIRT LOW AT THE THROAT SHOWED HIS STRONG WHITE NECK RISING LIKE A COLUMN FROM HIS BROAD SHOULDERS
587-54108-0038 AND SEEMED STRIVING TO OUTDO THE NIGHT IN BRILLIANCY FOR A WHILE KEMP MAINTAINED A SORT OF ROLAND FOR AN OLIVER CONVERSATION WITH HER BUT WITH HIS EYES CONTINUALLY STRAYING TO THE GIRL BEFORE HIM IT BECAME RATHER DIFFICULT
587-54108-0040 THE BALMY SUMMER FREIGHTED AIR MADE HER FEEL DROWSY SHE LISTENED ABSENTLY TO RUTH'S OCCASIONAL WARNINGS TO KEMP AND TO THE SWIFT DIP OF THE OARS NOW WE HAVE CLEAR SAILING FOR A STRETCH SAID RUTH AS THEY CAME TO A BROAD CURVE
587-54108-0041 SHE LEANED A LITTLE FARTHER FORWARD LOOKING PAST KEMP MAMMA THEN SHE STRAIGHTENED HERSELF BACK IN HER SEAT
587-54108-0043 DOCTOR KEMP MOVED QUIETLY BACK TO HIS FORMER POSITION FAR ACROSS THE RIVER A WOMAN'S SILVERY VOICE WAS SINGING THE SWEET OLD LOVE SONG JUANITA OVERHEAD THE GOLDEN CRESCENT MOON HUNG LOW FROM THE FLOOR OF HEAVEN PULSATING WITH STARS
587-54108-0044 SHE SCARCELY SEEMED TO BREATHE SO STILL SHE SAT HER SLENDER HANDS LOOSELY CLASPED IN HER LAP DOCTOR KEMP SAT OPPOSITE HER AND MISSUS LEVICE SLEPT SLOWLY AND MORE SLOWLY SPED THE TINY BOAT
587-54108-0046 SINGING OF LOVE THEIR EYES MET
587-54108-0047 EVER IN THE AFTER TIME WHEN RUTH HEARD THAT SONG SHE WAS AGAIN ROCKING IN THE FRAIL ROW BOAT UPON THE LOVELY RIVER AND A MAN'S DEEP GRAVE EYES HELD HERS AS IF THEY WOULD NEVER LET THEM GO
587-54108-0049 THEY HAD DRIFTED INTO A COVE AND SHE WAS COWERING FROM THE OVER HANGING BOUGHS I DO NOT CARE TO BE ABSALOMED WHERE WERE YOUR EYES RUTH SHE COMPLAINED AS KEMP PUSHED OUT WITH A HAPPY APOLOGETIC LAUGH
587-54108-0050 NO SHE ANSWERED A LITTLE BREATHLESSLY I BELIEVE I AM GROWING FAR SIGHTED IT MUST BE TIME TO SIGHT HOME NOW SAID HER MOTHER I AM QUITE CHILLY
587-54108-0052 AND THE SLIGHT WHITE FIGURE STOOD STILL TILL THEY CAME UP YOU ARE SO SLOW SHE SAID WITH A RECKLESS LITTLE LAUGH I FEEL AS IF I COULD FLY HOME ARE YOU LIGHT HEADED RUTH ASKED HER MOTHER BUT THE GIRL HAD FALLEN BEHIND THEM
587-54108-0053 SHE COULD NOT YET MEET HIS EYES AGAIN COME RUTH EITHER STAY WITH US OR JUST AHEAD OF US
587-54108-0055 AND STOOD INSIDE OF IT AS THEY DREW NEAR THEN YOU WILL NOT BE HOME TILL MONDAY HE SAID TAKING MISSUS LEVICE'S HAND AND RAISING HIS HAT AND I AM OFF ON THE EARLY MORNING TRAIN GOOD BY AS SHE TURNED IN AT THE GATE HE HELD OUT HIS HAND TO RUTH
587-54108-0056 HIS FINGERS CLOSED SOFTLY TIGHTLY OVER HERS SHE HEARD HIM SAY ALMOST INAUDIBLY TILL MONDAY SHE RAISED HER SHY EYES FOR ONE BRIEF SECOND TO HIS GLOWING ONES AND HE PASSED A TALL DARK FIGURE DOWN THE SHADOWY ROAD
625-132112-0000 THIS WAS INDEED THE EGYPT OF THE CONFEDERACY THE RICH GRANARY WHENCE POTATOES AND CORN AND COTTON POURED OUT TO THE FAMISHED AND RAGGED CONFEDERATE TROOPS AS THEY BATTLED FOR A CAUSE LOST LONG BEFORE EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE

625-132112-0007 THERE ON THE EDGE OF TOWN ARE FIVE HOUSES OF PROSTITUTES TWO OF BLACKS AND THREE OF WHITES AND IN ONE OF THE HOUSES OF THE WHITES A WORTHLESS BLACK BOY WAS HARBORED TOO OPENLY TWO YEARS AGO SO HE WAS HANGED FOR RAPE
625-132112-0009 AND THEY NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE GUILTY BUT BECAUSE THE STATE NEEDS CRIMINALS TO EKE OUT ITS INCOME BY THEIR FORCED LABOR IMMIGRANTS ARE HEIRS OF THE SLAVE BARON IN DOUGHERTY AND AS WE RIDE WESTWARD BY WIDE STRETCHING CORNFIELDS AND STUBBY ORCHARDS OF PEACH AND PEAR
625-132112-0010 WE SEE ON ALL SIDES WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF DARK FOREST A LAND OF CANAAN HERE AND THERE ARE TALES OF PROJECTS FOR MONEY GETTING BORN IN THE SWIFT DAYS OF RECONSTRUCTION
625-132112-0012 THE SOLEMN PINES HAVE DISAPPEARED AND THIS IS THE OAKEY WOODS WITH ITS WEALTH OF HICKORIES BEECHES OAKS AND PALMETTOS BUT A PALL OF DEBT HANGS OVER THE BEAUTIFUL LAND THE MERCHANTS ARE IN DEBT TO THE WHOLESALERS

625-132112-0019 WAS A PART OF THE FAMOUS BOLTON ESTATE AFTER THE WAR IT WAS FOR MANY YEARS WORKED BY GANGS OF NEGRO CONVICTS AND BLACK CONVICTS THEN WERE EVEN MORE PLENTIFUL THAN NOW IT WAS A WAY OF MAKING NEGROES WORK AND THE QUESTION OF GUILT WAS A MINOR ONE
625-132112-0021 BUT NOT UNTIL ONE OF THE FAIREST REGIONS OF THE OAKEY WOODS HAD BEEN RUINED AND RAVISHED INTO A RED WASTE OUT OF WHICH ONLY A YANKEE OR AN IMMIGRANT COULD SQUEEZE MORE BLOOD FROM DEBT CURSED TENANTS NO WONDER THAT LUKE BLACK
625-132112-0022 SLOW DULL AND DISCOURAGED SHUFFLES TO OUR CARRIAGE AND TALKS HOPELESSLY WHY SHOULD HE STRIVE EVERY YEAR FINDS HIM DEEPER IN DEBT HOW STRANGE THAT GEORGIA THE WORLD HERALDED REFUGE OF POOR DEBTORS
625-132112-0024 TWENTY YEARS YONDER SUNKEN CHEEKED OLD BLACK MAN HAS LABORED UNDER THAT SYSTEM AND NOW TURNED DAY LABORER IS SUPPORTING HIS WIFE AND BOARDING HIMSELF ON HIS WAGES OF A DOLLAR AND A HALF A WEEK RECEIVED ONLY PART OF THE YEAR
625-132112-0025 THE BOLTON CONVICT FARM FORMERLY INCLUDED THE NEIGHBORING PLANTATION HERE IT WAS THAT THE CONVICTS WERE LODGED IN THE GREAT LOG PRISON STILL STANDING A DISMAL PLACE IT STILL REMAINS WITH ROWS OF UGLY HUTS
625-132112-0027 THERE IS LITTLE OF THE JOYOUS ABANDON AND PLAYFULNESS WHICH WE ARE WONT TO ASSOCIATE WITH THE PLANTATION NEGRO AT BEST THE NATURAL GOOD NATURE IS EDGED WITH COMPLAINT OR HAS CHANGED INTO SULLENNESS AND GLOOM
625-132112-0028 AND STILL HAVING NOTHING TO BE SURE HE HAD GIVEN FOUR CHILDREN A COMMON SCHOOL TRAINING AND PERHAPS IF THE NEW FENCE LAW HAD NOT ALLOWED UNFENCED CROPS IN WEST DOUGHERTY HE MIGHT HAVE RAISED A LITTLE STOCK AND KEPT AHEAD
625-132112-0030 AND THEN HE SAID SLOWLY LET A WHITE MAN TOUCH ME AND HE DIES I DON'T BOAST THIS I DON'T SAY IT AROUND LOUD OR BEFORE THE CHILDREN BUT I MEAN IT
625-132112-0031 AND WE PASSED ON NOW SEARS
625-132112-0033 COULDN'T AFFORD BOOKS AND CLOTHES AND COULDN'T SPARE THEIR WORK THERE GO PART OF THEM TO THE FIELDS NOW THREE BIG BOYS ASTRIDE MULES AND A STRAPPING GIRL WITH BARE BROWN LEGS
625-132112-0034 HERE AND THERE WE MEET DISTINCT CHARACTERS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY ONE CAME OUT OF A PIECE OF NEWLY CLEARED GROUND MAKING A WIDE DETOUR TO AVOID THE SNAKES HE WAS AN OLD HOLLOW CHEEKED MAN WITH A DRAWN
625-132112-0036 WITH AN IMPERTURBABLE GRAVITY THAT SEEMED ALMOST SUSPICIOUS THEN HE CONTINUED MY MULE DIED LAST WEEK A CALAMITY IN THIS LAND EQUAL TO A DEVASTATING FIRE IN TOWN
625-132112-0037 BUT A WHITE MAN LOANED ME ANOTHER THEN HE ADDED EYEING US
625-132112-0039 THAT THE CONCERN SOON LANDED IN INEXTRICABLE BANKRUPTCY NOBODY LIVES IN THE OLD HOUSE NOW BUT A MAN COMES EACH WINTER OUT OF THE NORTH AND COLLECTS HIS HIGH RENTS I KNOW NOT WHICH ARE THE MORE TOUCHING SUCH OLD EMPTY HOUSES
625-132112-0040 OR THE HOMES OF THE MASTERS SONS SAD AND BITTER TALES LIE HIDDEN BACK OF THOSE WHITE DOORS TALES OF POVERTY OF STRUGGLE OF DISAPPOINTMENT A REVOLUTION SUCH AS THAT OF SIXTY THREE IS A TERRIBLE THING
625-132112-0042 I REMEMBER WHEELING AROUND A BEND IN THE ROAD BESIDE A GRACEFUL BIT OF FOREST AND A SINGING BROOK A LONG LOW HOUSE FACED US WITH PORCH AND FLYING PILLARS GREAT OAKEN DOOR AND A BROAD LAWN SHINING IN THE EVENING SUN
625-132112-0043 BUT THE WINDOW PANES WERE GONE THE PILLARS WERE WORM EATEN AND THE MOSS GROWN ROOF WAS FALLING IN HALF CURIOUSLY I PEERED THROUGH THE UNHINGED DOOR AND SAW WHERE ON THE WALL ACROSS THE HALL
625-132112-0045 THEN TOO THERE ARE FEWER SIGNS OF A ROMANTIC PAST AND MORE OF SYSTEMATIC MODERN LAND GRABBING AND MONEY GETTING WHITE PEOPLE ARE MORE IN EVIDENCE HERE
625-132112-0046 AND THERE WERE FENCES AND MEADOWS HERE AND THERE MOST OF THIS LAND WAS POOR AND BENEATH THE NOTICE OF THE SLAVE BARON BEFORE THE WAR SINCE THEN HIS POOR RELATIONS AND FOREIGN IMMIGRANTS HAVE SEIZED IT

625-132112-0052 WE PASS THE MUNSON PLACE WHERE A PLUCKY WHITE WIDOW IS RENTING AND STRUGGLING AND THE ELEVEN HUNDRED ACRES OF THE SENNET PLANTATION WITH ITS NEGRO OVERSEER
625-132112-0054 THE OVERSEERS ARE WHITE AND THE CABINS ARE BARE BOARD HOUSES SCATTERED HERE AND THERE THE RENTS ARE HIGH AND DAY LABORERS AND CONTRACT HANDS ABOUND IT IS A KEEN HARD STRUGGLE FOR LIVING HERE

625-132118-0014 I SAW THE SHADOW OF THE VEIL AS IT PASSED OVER MY BABY I SAW THE COLD CITY TOWERING ABOVE THE BLOOD RED LAND I HELD MY FACE BESIDE HIS LITTLE CHEEK
625-132118-0016 HE TINGED HER EVERY DREAM AND IDEALIZED HER EVERY EFFORT NO HANDS BUT HERS MUST TOUCH AND GARNISH THOSE LITTLE LIMBS NO DRESS OR FRILL MUST TOUCH THEM THAT HAD NOT WEARIED HER FINGERS
625-132118-0017 NO VOICE BUT HERS COULD COAX HIM OFF TO DREAMLAND AND SHE AND HE TOGETHER SPOKE SOME SOFT AND UNKNOWN TONGUE AND IN IT HELD COMMUNION I TOO MUSED ABOVE HIS LITTLE WHITE BED
625-132118-0019 THAT WAS TO RISE WITHIN THE VEIL AND SO WE DREAMED AND LOVED AND PLANNED BY FALL AND WINTER AND THE FULL FLUSH OF THE LONG SOUTHERN SPRING
625-132118-0020 TILL THE HOT WINDS ROLLED FROM THE FETID GULF TILL THE ROSES SHIVERED AND THE STILL STERN SUN QUIVERED ITS AWFUL LIGHT OVER THE HILLS OF ATLANTA AND THEN ONE NIGHT THE LITTLE FEET PATTERED WEARILY TO THE WEE WHITE BED
625-132118-0022 OUT INTO THE STARLIGHT I CREPT TO ROUSE THE GRAY PHYSICIAN THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE SHADOW OF DEATH THE HOURS TREMBLED ON THE NIGHT LISTENED
625-132118-0023 AND THEN HIS LITTLE SOUL LEAPT LIKE A STAR THAT TRAVELS IN THE NIGHT AND LEFT A WORLD OF DARKNESS IN ITS TRAIN THE DAY CHANGED NOT

625-132118-0029 AND THE CHILDREN HOVERED AND FLUTTERED ABOUT HIM I CAN SEE HIM NOW CHANGING LIKE THE SKY FROM SPARKLING LAUGHTER TO DARKENING FROWNS AND THEN TO WONDERING THOUGHTFULNESS AS HE WATCHED THE WORLD
625-132118-0031 AND IN HIS LITTLE WORLD WALKED SOULS ALONE UNCOLORED AND UNCLOTHED I YEA ALL MEN ARE LARGER AND PURER BY THE INFINITE BREADTH OF THAT ONE LITTLE LIFE
625-132118-0032 SHE WHO IN SIMPLE CLEARNESS OF VISION SEES BEYOND THE STARS SAID WHEN HE HAD FLOWN HE WILL BE HAPPY THERE HE EVER LOVED BEAUTIFUL THINGS

669-129074-0029 AND HAD BEEN CONSTANTLY BEFRIENDED BY THE GOOD WILLIAM WHY WHEN YOUR PAPA WAS A LITTLE BOY SHE SAID HE OFTEN TOLD ME THAT IT WAS WILLIAM WHO DEFENDED HIM AGAINST A TYRANT AT THE SCHOOL WHERE THEY WERE
669-129074-0030 AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP NEVER CEASED FROM THAT DAY UNTIL THE LAST WHEN YOUR DEAR FATHER FELL DID DOBBIN KILL THE MAN WHO KILLED PAPA

696-92939-0007 AND AT FIRST THEY WERE INCLINED TO LOOK UPON MISS CAVELL AS AN UNTRAINED OUTSIDER BUT HER TACT EFFICIENCY AND SKILL SOON WON THE HEARTS OF THESE GOOD WOMEN WHO AFFORDED HER EVERY COURTESY AND ENTERED INTO CORDIAL COOPERATION WITH HER
696-92939-0009 BUT HER MOTHER WAS CLOSE TO HER HEART AND SHE SAW HER AS OFTEN AS SHE COULD I MAY BE LOOKED ON AS AN OLD MAID SHE IS REPORTED AS SAYING BUT WITH MY WORK AND MY MOTHER I AM A VERY HAPPY ONE AND DESIRE NOTHING MORE AS LONG AS I HAVE THESE TWO
696-92939-0010 WHEN WAR WAS DECLARED MISS CAVELL LOST NO TIME IN HURRYING BACK TO BRUSSELS BELIEVING THAT HER DUTY CALLED HER THERE SHE WROTE A LETTER COMMENTING ON THE GERMAN ARMY WHEN IT SWEPT THROUGH BELGIUM AND IN IT SHE VOICED HER PITY FOR THE TIRED FOOTSORE GERMAN SOLDIERS

696-92939-0016 ON THE NIGHT OF AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN FIFTEEN WE ARE TOLD MISS CAVELL WAS TYING UP THE WOUNDS OF A WOUNDED GERMAN SOLDIER WHEN A GROUP OF ARMED MEN ENTERED THE ROOM AND THEIR LEADER TOLD HER ROUGHLY THAT SHE WAS UNDER ARREST
696-92939-0018 SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES KNOW OF THE AFFAIR OR OF WHAT THEY PROPOSED TO DO BUT WORD OF HER PLIGHT DID REACH ENGLAND THROUGH A TRAVELER AND AT ONCE THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT REQUESTED THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR DOCTOR PAGE
696-92939-0019 TO GET WHAT INFORMATION HE COULD FROM BRAND WHITLOCK THE AMERICAN MINISTER IN BELGIUM HE WENT AT ONCE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES BUT THEY EVADED HIS QUESTIONS AND WAITED TEN DAYS BEFORE GIVING HIM A REPLY THEN THE GERMANS SENT HIM A STATEMENT
696-92939-0021 FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE
696-92939-0022 AN AMERICAN LAWYER MISTER DE LEVAL WAS REQUESTED BY MISTER WHITLOCK TO TAKE MISS CAVELL'S CASE AND DO WHATEVER WAS POSSIBLE IN HER BEHALF HE WAS NOT ALLOWED TO SEE THE PRISONER AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THE DOCUMENTS IN THE CASE UNTIL THE TRIAL BEGAN
696-92939-0024 AND THAT HE WOULD KEEP THEM INFORMED OF ALL THE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CASE ALL THESE PROMISES WERE BROKEN IT IS TRUE THAT HE SENT A NOTE A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE TRIAL TELLING MISTER WHITLOCK THAT THE CASE WAS ABOUT TO COME TO COURT
696-92939-0025 HE NEVER INFORMED THEM THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD BEEN IMPOSED HE NEVER CAME TO SEE THEM AFTERWARD AND WHEN THEY SOUGHT HIM FOR AN EXPLANATION AND FOR ASSISTANCE HE HAD DISAPPEARED MISS CAVELL WAS KEPT IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT FOR TWO MONTHS
696-92939-0027 HE DID EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SECURE HER PARDON OR AT LEAST A MODERATION OF THE PUNISHMENT HE WROTE TO BARON VON DER LANCKEN POINTING OUT IN A CLEAR AND DECISIVE MANNER THAT MISS CAVELL HAD SERVED THE GERMANS BY CARING FOR THEIR WOUNDED
696-92939-0028 AND THAT THE DEATH SENTENCE HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN INFLICTED FOR THE CRIME OF WHICH SHE WAS ACCUSED HE ALSO WROTE A NOTE TO THE BARON WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS MY DEAR BARON I AM TOO ILL TO PRESENT MY REQUEST TO YOU IN PERSON
696-92939-0030 ALL THROUGH THE DAY THE AMERICAN LEGATION SENT MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE TO THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES ASKING FOR INFORMATION THEY RECEIVED NONE AT SIX TWENTY IN THE EVENING THEY WERE TOLD BY A SUBORDINATE THAT THE SENTENCE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN
696-92939-0031 ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
696-92939-0033 AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
696-92939-0034 EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
696-92939-0036 AND IN MISS CAVELL'S HOME TOWN EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN WAS SWORN INTO THE ARMY A BITTER DENUNCIATION OF THE GERMAN ACT WAS MADE BY SIR EDWARD GREY THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD ONLY A POOR EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
696-92939-0037 IN BRIEF THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IS AS FOLLOWS THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE OF WHICH MISS CAVELL WAS ACCUSED THEY HAD KEPT HER IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND PREVENTED HER FROM CONSULTING AN ADVOCATE UP TO THE TIME OF HER TRIAL
696-92939-0039 AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
696-93314-0000 THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
696-93314-0002 THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
696-93314-0003 DO YOU WANT SOME HE SAID AND ON THE INSTANT HIS HAND HAD FOUND A STRONG JUTTING STONE HIS FOOT A FIRM LEDGE AND SHE SAW HIS FIGURE GREY FLANNEL AGAINST GREY STONE GO UP THE WALL TOWARDS THE YELLOW FLOWERS
696-93314-0005 HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
696-93314-0006 AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
696-93314-0008 WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
696-93314-0009 AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
696-93314-0011 NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
696-93314-0012 AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
696-93314-0014 DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
696-93314-0015 FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
696-93314-0017 HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
696-93314-0018 A PICTURE TO WRING THE HEART OF THE ONLOOKER WITH ENVY OR SYMPATHY ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONLOOKER A MAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS WHO PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE AND TOOK IN THE FULL CHARM AND MEANING OF THE SCENE
696-93314-0020 IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
696-93314-0021 IF HE DID THE LESS PRECISE AND DEVOTIONAL MAY PARDON HIM HE HAD LOVED THE GIRL SINCE HER EARLY TEENS AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY'S POST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE APPOINTMENT THAT ONE MIGHT MARRY ON THE APPOINTMENT HAD COME THROUGH HER FATHER
696-93314-0023 AND CALLED ON HER FATHER TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION AND SET FORTH HIS PROSPECTS HIS COMING WAS HERALDED BY A LETTER FROM HER ONE MUST NOT QUOTE IT IT IS NOT PROPER TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY LETTERS TO A TRUSTED FATHER FROM A CHILD ONLY AND ADORED
696-93314-0024 ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
696-93314-0026 AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
696-93314-0027 HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
696-93314-0029 BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0030 BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
696-93314-0032 WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
696-93314-0033 THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
696-93314-0035 NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
696-93314-0036 HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
696-93314-0038 OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0041 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
696-93314-0042 THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
696-93314-0044 I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0045 WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
696-93314-0047 LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
696-93314-0048 AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
696-93314-0050 HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
696-93314-0051 AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0054 YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
696-93314-0056 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
696-93314-0059 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0062 YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
696-93314-0063 WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
696-93314-0065 DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
696-93314-0066 WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
730-358-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ERA OF MY BEING
730-358-0001 BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
730-358-0003 THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
730-358-0004 THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
730-358-0006 AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
730-358-0007 I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOME CLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OF NIGHT
730-358-0009 THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
730-358-0010 NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
730-358-0012 I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITH DRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE
730-358-0013 WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MY EARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS
730-358-0015 SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
730-358-0016 THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
730-358-0018 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
730-358-0019 IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
730-358-0021 AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
730-358-0022 I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
730-358-0024 AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
730-358-0025 AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED
730-358-0027 AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
730-358-0028 I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
730-358-0030 THIS WAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED AN OLD MAN SAT IN IT NEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST HE TURNED ON HEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY
730-358-0031 HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
730-358-0033 I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP
730-358-0034 WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
730-358-0036 ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
730-358-0037 REFUGE IN A LOW HOVEL QUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HAD BEHELD IN THE VILLAGE THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEAT AND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE I DARED NOT ENTER IT
730-358-0039 HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
730-358-0040 THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
730-358-0042 ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
730-358-0043 HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW I RETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBERED TOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER
730-358-0045 WHICH FLOWED BY MY RETREAT THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPT PERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM
730-358-0046 THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
730-358-0048 HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
730-358-0049 AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
730-358-0051 ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEEN FILLED UP WITH WOOD IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE
730-358-0052 WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
730-358-0054 THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER
730-358-0055 HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
730-358-0057 BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
730-358-0058 AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
730-358-0060 THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
730-358-0061 THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
730-358-0063 DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
730-358-0064 THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
730-359-0001 WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
730-359-0002 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0004 AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
730-359-0005 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0007 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0010 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0011 THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
730-359-0013 AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
730-359-0014 THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
730-359-0016 BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
730-359-0017 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0019 NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
730-359-0020 AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0023 AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
730-359-0025 OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
730-359-0026 AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
730-359-0028 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0031 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0034 THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
730-359-0035 OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
730-359-0037 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0038 AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
730-359-0040 AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
730-359-0041 MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
730-359-0043 AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
730-359-0044 MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
730-359-0046 I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
730-359-0047 AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
730-359-0049 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
730-360-0001 IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
730-360-0002 MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
730-360-0004 THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
730-360-0005 THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
730-360-0007 AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
730-360-0008 EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
730-360-0010 SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
730-360-0011 AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
730-360-0013 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0014 PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
730-360-0016 WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
730-360-0017 AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
730-360-0019 THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
730-360-0020 THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
730-360-0022 IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
730-360-0023 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
730-360-0025 WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
730-360-0026 THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
730-360-0028 AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
730-360-0029 DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
730-360-0031 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
730-360-0032 A CONDITION MORE ABJECT THAN THAT
730-360-0034 I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
730-360-0035 UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
730-360-0037 SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
730-360-0038 AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
730-360-0040 MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH OTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY
730-360-0041 HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
730-360-0043 ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
730-360-0044 I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEING RESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME WHAT WAS I
831-130739-0001 A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
831-130739-0002 YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
831-130739-0004 AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
831-130739-0005 HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
831-130739-0007 NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
831-130739-0008 HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
831-130739-0010 HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
831-130739-0011 MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
831-130739-0013 HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
831-130739-0014 ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
831-130739-0016 IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
831-130739-0017 THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
831-130739-0019 AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
831-130739-0020 ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
831-130739-0022 AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
831-130739-0023 THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
831-130739-0025 HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
831-130739-0026 EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
831-130739-0028 WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
831-130739-0029 CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
831-130739-0031 FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
831-130739-0032 TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
831-130739-0034 RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
831-130739-0035 A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
831-130739-0037 TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
831-130739-0038 BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
831-130739-0040 A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
831-130739-0041 THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
831-130739-0043 HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
831-130739-0044 THEY'RE GOING FAIRLY WELL SIR
831-130739-0046 HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
831-130739-0047 OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
831-130739-0049 THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH
831-130739-0050 AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS

831-130739-0053 YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
831-130739-0055 WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
831-130739-0056 WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS

831-130739-0061 HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
831-130739-0062 A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
831-130746-0001 THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
831-130746-0002 THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
831-130746-0004 MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
831-130746-0005 INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD

831-130746-0019 AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
831-130746-0020 KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS
831-130746-0022 I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
831-130746-0023 THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY

831-130746-0026 HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
831-130746-0028 IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
831-130746-0029 HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
831-130746-0031 THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
831-130746-0032 AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
831-130746-0034 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
831-130746-0035 AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
831-130746-0037 WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE

839-130898-0004 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0006 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0010 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0012 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0015 BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0018 SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A THREE THOUSAND METER PIT HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
839-130898-0019 A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
839-130898-0021 VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO
839-130898-0022 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0024 BLENNIES AND SALMON IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
839-130898-0025 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0027 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0031 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0034 BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
839-130898-0036 OF FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FISH MAKING TWENTY TWO MILLION OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0039 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0040 OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
839-130898-0042 AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0045 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0046 AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
839-130898-0048 ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
839-130898-0049 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0051 WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
839-130898-0052 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0054 CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING
839-130898-0055 WITHOUT A TRIAL AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED BY JULY TWENTY THIRD THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0060 A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
839-130898-0061 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0063 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0064 TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
839-130898-0066 ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
839-130898-0067 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0069 I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
839-130898-0070 WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0073 IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST IT DID NOT ALL DAY LONG ON MAY THIRTY FIRST THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
839-130898-0076 HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL REMORSE OR REGRET FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
839-130898-0078 CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
839-130898-0079 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0081 AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE
839-130898-0082 AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US I'M UNABLE TO SAY I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK
839-130898-0084 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0087 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0090 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
839-130898-0091 IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
839-130898-0093 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
839-130898-0094 WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
839-130898-0096 SEVENTY FOUR YEARS AGO TO THE DAY AT THIS VERY SPOT IN LATITUDE
839-130898-0097 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0099 NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR THE AVENGER A SPLENDID NAME
887-123289-0000 WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS
887-123289-0002 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0005 THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
887-123289-0006 AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
887-123289-0008 ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
887-123289-0009 I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
887-123289-0011 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
887-123289-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0014 WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
887-123289-0015 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0018 AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
887-123289-0020 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0023 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0024 THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
887-123289-0026 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0027 AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
887-123289-0029 THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
887-123289-0030 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0032 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0035 HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
887-123289-0036 AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
909-131041-0001 THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THESE WHO HAS APPEARED IN PRINT
909-131041-0002 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0004 AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
909-131041-0005 SELECTED BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM THE GENERAL MASS WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO POSSESS THE INFORMATION AND DISCERNMENT REQUISITE TO SUCH COMPLICATED INVESTIGATIONS
909-131041-0007 WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
909-131041-0008 ARE TO ASSEMBLE AND VOTE IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN THIS DETACHED AND DIVIDED SITUATION WILL EXPOSE THEM MUCH LESS TO HEATS AND FERMENTS WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED FROM THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAN IF THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVENED
909-131041-0010 THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
909-131041-0011 HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
909-131041-0013 TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
909-131041-0014 NO SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING A PLACE OF TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER THE UNITED STATES CAN BE OF THE NUMBERS OF THE ELECTORS THUS WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE THE IMMEDIATE AGENTS IN THE ELECTION
909-131041-0016 THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
909-131041-0017 IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
909-131041-0019 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0020 WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
909-131041-0022 IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT OUT OF THE CANDIDATES WHO SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES THE MAN WHO IN THEIR OPINION MAY BE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE OFFICE
909-131041-0023 THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
909-131041-0025 OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
909-131041-0026 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
909-131041-0028 THAT THE TRUE TEST OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ITS APTITUDE AND TENDENCY TO PRODUCE A GOOD ADMINISTRATION THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TO BE CHOSEN IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE PRESIDENT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE SENATE IS TO DO IN RESPECT TO THE FORMER
909-131041-0029 WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AS VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OBJECTED TO AS SUPERFLUOUS IF NOT MISCHIEVOUS
909-131041-0031 APPLY WITH GREAT IF NOT WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE MANNER OF APPOINTING THE OTHER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN THIS AS IN MOST OTHER INSTANCES THE OBJECTION WHICH IS MADE WOULD LIE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS STATE WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
909-131044-0000 THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
909-131044-0002 IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
909-131044-0003 AND OF COURSE WILL BE WILLING TO RISK MORE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THIS REMARK IS NOT LESS APPLICABLE TO A POLITICAL PRIVILEGE OR HONOR OR TRUST THAN TO ANY ARTICLE OF ORDINARY PROPERTY
909-131044-0005 FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
909-131044-0006 IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0009 OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
909-131044-0011 THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
909-131044-0012 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0014 BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0015 THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
909-131044-0017 TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
909-131044-0018 AND ANOTHER TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE FIRST COMPORTS WITH THE LAST VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNITES ALL POWER IN THE SAME HANDS
909-131044-0020 THEY OFTEN APPEAR DISPOSED TO EXERT AN IMPERIOUS CONTROL OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AS THEY COMMONLY HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE
909-131044-0021 THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
909-131044-0023 THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
909-131044-0024 OBNOXIOUS TO ITS RESENTMENT IT MAY BE ASKED ALSO WHETHER A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND IF IT WOULD NOT WHETHER A LESS PERIOD WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE RECOMMENDED BY GREATER SECURITY AGAINST AMBITIOUS DESIGNS
909-131044-0026 THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
909-131044-0027 AND IN WHICH HE MIGHT REASONABLY PROMISE HIMSELF THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE IT ARRIVED TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEASURES HE MIGHT INCLINE TO PURSUE THOUGH IT BE PROBABLE THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE MOMENT
909-131044-0029 AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
909-131044-0030 IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
909-131044-0032 ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
909-131044-0033 WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0007 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0013 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0014 IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0017 AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0022 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
909-131045-0023 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0025 WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0028 IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
909-131045-0029 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0031 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0032 A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
909-131045-0034 AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
909-131045-0035 THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0040 AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
909-131045-0041 WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
909-131045-0043 BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
911-128684-0000 ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
911-128684-0002 IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
911-128684-0003 THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
911-128684-0005 IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
911-128684-0006 A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
911-128684-0008 THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
911-128684-0009 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0011 IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
911-128684-0012 TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
911-128684-0014 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0015 BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
911-128684-0017 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0018 IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
911-128684-0020 BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
911-128684-0021 IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
911-128684-0023 CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
911-128684-0024 IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
911-128684-0026 THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
911-128684-0027 WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
911-128684-0029 AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
911-128684-0030 OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
911-128684-0032 AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
911-128684-0033 MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
911-128684-0035 AN AGREEABLE DEGREE OF HEAT OR AN AGREEABLE FEELING OCCASIONED BY THE DEGREE OF HEAT EITHER WILL DO AND LANGUAGE WOULD LOSE MOST OF ITS ESTHETIC AND RHETORICAL VALUE
911-128684-0036 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0038 AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
911-128684-0039 AND DOUBTLESS PASSES WITH MOST READERS FOR ALL RIGHT PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDYING OUR PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENT HAVE UNEARTHED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH MOVEMENT IS FELT IN GENERAL
911-128684-0041 WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT BY THE MOON IT IS AS IF BOTH CLOUDS AND MOON AND WE OURSELVES SHARED IN THE MOTION IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF AMNESIA
911-128684-0042 PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
911-128684-0044 IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
911-128684-0045 MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
911-128684-0047 IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
911-128684-0048 WE SHALL PROBABLY JUDGE IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH WITH THE AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ARE CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY PURE CONDITION LASTS IN PRACTICAL LIFE NO URGENT NEED HAS YET ARISEN FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT THEM AS RIGOROUSLY MENTAL
911-128684-0050 ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
911-128684-0051 THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
911-128684-0053 INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
911-128684-0054 ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
911-128684-0056 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0057 ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
911-128684-0059 BUT ONLY A TRANSLOCATION OF EXPERIENCES FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER A GROUPING OF THEM WITH ONE SET OR ANOTHER OF ASSOCIATES FOR DEFINITELY PRACTICAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENDS
911-128684-0060 I WILL SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE PERSISTENT AMBIGUITY OF RELATIONS THEY ARE UNDENIABLE PARTS OF PURE EXPERIENCE YET WHILE COMMON SENSE AND WHAT I CALL RADICAL EMPIRICISM STAND FOR THEIR BEING OBJECTIVE
911-128684-0062 TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0063 IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
911-128684-0065 ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
911-128684-0066 EVEN SUCH THINGS AS FORCES TENSIONS AND ACTIVITIES CAN AT A PINCH BE REGARDED AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTIONS SO FAR THEN AS THE PHYSICAL WORLD MEANS THE COLLECTION OF CONTENTS THAT DETERMINE IN EACH OTHER CERTAIN REGULAR CHANGES
911-128684-0068 WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
911-128684-0069 THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
911-128684-0071 MEANS ALSO THAT IT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE BODILY EFFECTS UPON US ALTERATIONS OF TONE AND TENSION OF HEART BEAT AND BREATHING OF VASCULAR AND VISCERAL ACTION
911-128684-0072 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
911-128684-0074 WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0075 FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
911-128684-0077 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0078 FITNESS FIXES THEIR ORDER AND CONNECTION I NEED ONLY REFER FOR THIS ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL LIFE
911-128684-0080 IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
911-128684-0081 BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
911-128684-0083 THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
911-128684-0084 IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
911-128684-0086 SOMETIMES AGAIN I THINK OF IT AS MINE I SORT IT WITH THE ME AND THEN CERTAIN LOCAL CHANGES AND DETERMINATIONS IN IT PASS FOR SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS ITS BREATHING IS MY THINKING
911-128684-0087 ITS SENSORIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE MY ATTENTION
911-128684-0089 PROVE HOW HARD IT IS TO DECIDE BY BARE INTROSPECTION WHAT IT IS IN EXPERIENCES THAT SHALL MAKE THEM EITHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL IT SURELY CAN BE NOTHING INTRINSIC IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0090 IT IS THEIR WAY OF BEHAVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEIR SYSTEM OF RELATIONS THEIR FUNCTION AND ALL THESE THINGS VARY WITH THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND IT OPPORTUNE TO CONSIDER THEM I THINK I MAY CONCLUDE THEN
911-130578-0000 AND FOR THIS THE VILLAGE BOYS WITH WHOM HE PLAYED USED TO QUARREL WITH HIM SAYING FATHERLESS ORPHAN WHY DO YOU CHEAT SO ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER WHY THEY CALLED HIM THAT NAME AND WHETHER HIS FATHER WAS REALLY DEAD
911-130578-0001 HE IS ALIVE SAID SHE BUT A LONG TIME AGO A RHINOCEROS CARRIED HIM OFF ON ITS HORN THEN THE BOY VOWED THAT HE WOULD GO IN SEARCH OF HIS FATHER AND MADE HIS MOTHER PUT HIM UP PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
911-130578-0003 GRANNIE GRANNIE OPEN THE DOOR I HAVE NO SON AND NO GRANDCHILDREN TO CALL ME GRANNIE GRUMBLED THE OLD WOMAN AND WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SEE WHO WAS THERE AND WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM SHE SAID HO
911-130578-0004 YOU ARE MY GRANDSON YES ANSWERED HE I AM YOUR GRANDCHILD SO SHE CALLED HIM INSIDE AND GAVE HIM A BED TO SLEEP ON THE OLD WOMAN WAS CALLED HUTIBUDI
911-130578-0006 HE ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS EATING SOME PULSE I GOT FROM THE VILLAGE HEADMAN GIVE ME A LITTLE TO TRY HE BEGGED I AM SORRY MY CHILD I HAVE FINISHED IT ALL
911-130578-0007 BUT REALLY SHE HAD NONE TO GIVE HOWEVER SHE ONLY HURT HER JAWS BITING SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO GROAN WITH PAIN WHAT ARE YOU GROANING FOR GRANNIE SAID THE BOY
911-130578-0009 BUT THIS ONLY BROKE HER TEETH AND MADE HER MOUTH BLEED SO THAT THE PAIN WAS WORSE THAN BEFORE THEN THE BOY JEERED AT HER AND SAID DID YOU THINK GRANNIE THAT YOU COULD BITE MY IRON BOW AND ARROWS SO SAYING HE LEFT HER
911-130578-0010 AND CONTINUED THE SEARCH FOR HIS FATHER
911-130578-0012 AND CLIMBED UP A TALL SAL TREE FROM THE TREE HE WATCHED THE BISON GO DOWN TO THE WATER TO DRINK AND THEN GO BACK INTO THE JUNGLE AND AFTER THEM TIGERS AND BEARS CAME DOWN TO THE WATER
911-130578-0013 THE SIGHT OF THEM FRIGHTENED HIM AND HE SANG DRINK YOUR FILL TIGER I SHALL NOT SHOOT YOU
911-130578-0015 AND AMONG THEM WAS ONE WHICH HAD THE DRIED UP BODY OF THE BOY'S FATHER STUCK ON ITS HORN THE BOY WAS RATHER FRIGHTENED AND SANG
911-130578-0016 HE PUT AN ARROW THROUGH IT AND IT TURNED A SOMERSAULT AND FELL OVER DEAD
911-130578-0018 A MAN SUDDENLY STOOD BEFORE HIM AND ASKED WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND WHEN HE HEARD SAID CRY NO MORE TAKE A CLOTH AND WET IT IN THE LAKE AND COVER YOUR FATHER'S BODY WITH IT
911-130578-0019 AND THEN WHIP THE BODY WITH A MERAL TWIG AND HE WILL COME TO LIFE SO SAYING THE STRANGER SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND THE BOY OBEYED HIS INSTRUCTIONS AND BEHOLD HIS FATHER SAT UP ALIVE AND RUBBING HIS EYES SAID
1034-121119-0000 CHAPTER NINETY NINE THE LAW WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUIETLY
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0003 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0004 AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
1034-121119-0006 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0009 WAS ASCENDING THE STAIRS LEADING TO DEBRAY'S APARTMENTS
1034-121119-0010 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0012 AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BECOME INTERESTING DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
1034-121119-0013 AWAITED THE RETURN OF DEBRAY IN THE LITTLE GREEN ROOM SEATED BETWEEN TWO BASKETS OF FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD THAT MORNING SENT AND WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED
1034-121119-0015 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0016 AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
1034-121119-0018 AFTER WHICH THEY DESIRED ME TO LEAVE SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED ME NO LONGER
1034-121119-0019 MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0022 AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
1034-121119-0024 AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
1034-121119-0025 SUPPORTED BY AN HONORABLE NAME HOW COULD SHE EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM THIS LABYRINTH TO WHOM WOULD SHE APPLY TO HELP HER OUT OF THIS PAINFUL SITUATION DEBRAY TO WHOM SHE HAD RUN WITH THE FIRST INSTINCT OF A WOMAN TOWARDS THE MAN SHE LOVES AND WHO YET BETRAYS HER
1034-121119-0027 BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0030 APPEARED TO THE BARONESS AS IF SHAPED FOR THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE BUT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCUREUR SHOULD STOP THERE SHE WOULD SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTIES AS A MAGISTRATE SHE WOULD AT LEAST
1034-121119-0031 OBTAIN ALL THE INDULGENCE HE COULD ALLOW SHE WOULD INVOKE THE PAST RECALL OLD RECOLLECTIONS SHE WOULD SUPPLICATE HIM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF GUILTY YET HAPPY DAYS
1034-121119-0033 AT NINE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING SHE AROSE AND WITHOUT RINGING FOR HER MAID OR GIVING THE LEAST SIGN OF HER ACTIVITY SHE DRESSED HERSELF IN THE SAME SIMPLE STYLE AS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THEN RUNNING DOWN STAIRS SHE LEFT THE HOTEL WALKED TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE
1034-121119-0034 FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
1034-121119-0036 MADAME DANGLARS INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED AT THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE MANSION
1034-121119-0037 THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD
1034-121119-0039 FIRST MADAME WHO ARE YOU WHO AM I YOU KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH WE NO LONGER KNOW ANY ONE MADAME

1034-121119-0045 DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DOOR WAS OPENED WIDE ENOUGH TO ADMIT HER AND WHEN SHE HAD PASSED THROUGH IT WAS AGAIN SHUT WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF HER FOR AN INSTANT THE CONCIERGE TOOK A WHISTLE FROM HIS POCKET AS SOON AS THEY ENTERED THE COURT AND BLEW IT
1034-121119-0046 YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS POOR FELLOW MADAME
1034-121119-0048 PREOCCUPIED AS MADAME DANGLARS HAD BEEN WITH THE OBJECT OF HER VISIT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED FROM THESE UNDERLINGS APPEARED TO HER SO INSULTING THAT SHE BEGAN BY COMPLAINING OF IT

1034-121119-0084 WITH A FEVERISH RAGE WHICH GAVE A FEROCIOUS ELOQUENCE TO HIS WORDS
1034-121119-0085 THIS YOUNG MAN THOUGH A MURDERER IS AN ORPHAN ABANDONED BY EVERYBODY SO MUCH THE WORSE OR RATHER SO MUCH THE BETTER

1040-133433-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN WHEN WENDY GREW UP I HOPE YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT BECAME OF THE OTHER BOYS THEY WERE WAITING BELOW TO GIVE WENDY TIME TO EXPLAIN ABOUT THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD COUNTED FIVE HUNDRED THEY WENT UP
1040-133433-0001 THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
1040-133433-0003 THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY

1040-133433-0006 BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
1040-133433-0007 I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0010 BUT AT ANY RATE THEY FOUND CORNERS AND THEY ALL FITTED IN AS FOR PETER HE SAW WENDY ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HE FLEW AWAY HE DID NOT EXACTLY COME TO THE WINDOW BUT HE BRUSHED AGAINST IT IN PASSING SO THAT SHE COULD OPEN IT IF SHE LIKED AND CALL TO HIM
1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0013 WOULD YOU SEND ME TO SCHOOL HE INQUIRED CRAFTILY YES AND THEN TO AN OFFICE I SUPPOSE SO
1040-133433-0015 AND MISSUS DARLING STRETCHED OUT HER ARMS TO HIM BUT HE REPULSED HER KEEP BACK LADY
1040-133433-0016 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO LIVE WITH TINK IN THE HOUSE WE BUILT FOR WENDY THE FAIRIES ARE TO PUT IT HIGH UP AMONG THE TREE TOPS WHERE THEY SLEEP AT NIGHTS HOW LOVELY CRIED WENDY SO LONGINGLY THAT MISSUS DARLING TIGHTENED HER GRIP I THOUGHT ALL THE FAIRIES WERE DEAD MISSUS DARLING SAID
1040-133433-0018 I SHALL HAVE TINK TINK CAN'T GO A TWENTIETH PART OF THE WAY ROUND SHE REMINDED HIM A LITTLE TARTLY
1040-133433-0019 TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS
1040-133433-0021 LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
1040-133433-0022 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0024 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
1040-133433-0025 IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
1040-133433-0027 SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
1040-133433-0028 WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE ARCH ENEMY DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHE ASKED AMAZED HOW YOU KILLED HIM AND SAVED ALL OUR LIVES I FORGET THEM AFTER I KILL THEM HE REPLIED CARELESSLY WHEN SHE EXPRESSED A DOUBTFUL HOPE THAT TINKER BELL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER HE SAID
1040-133433-0030 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0033 PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
1040-133433-0034 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0037 YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
1040-133433-0039 WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THEM THEY WERE MOSTLY ABOUT PETER PAN SHE LOVED TO HEAR OF PETER AND WENDY TOLD HER ALL SHE COULD REMEMBER IN THE VERY NURSERY FROM WHICH THE FAMOUS FLIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1040-133433-0040 WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
1040-133433-0042 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1040-133433-0045 WHY CAN'T YOU FLY NOW MOTHER BECAUSE I AM GROWN UP DEAREST WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP THEY FORGET THE WAY WHY DO THEY FORGET THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0046 IT IS ONLY THE GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS WHO CAN FLY WHAT IS GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0048 THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW

1040-133433-0052 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0054 TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
1040-133433-0055 JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR

1040-133433-0058 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER

1040-133433-0063 SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0066 SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN SMILING AT IT ALL
1040-133433-0067 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0069 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0070 OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
1040-133433-0072 BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
1040-133433-0073 YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
1040-133433-0075 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0076 IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
1040-133433-0078 OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0079 AS YOU LOOK AT WENDY YOU MAY SEE HER HAIR BECOMING WHITE AND HER FIGURE LITTLE AGAIN FOR ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO
1069-133699-0000 HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
1069-133699-0001 TO DEAL WITH HER IN STRICT RECIPROCITY HE CARRIED OUT HIS RESOLVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TACT AND THE YOUNG LADY FOUND IN RENEWED CONTACT WITH HIM NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS FOR UNSHRINKING ENQUIRY
1069-133699-0003 SHE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN TRUTH THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS OF THE LIGHTEST AND THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MISS STACKPOLE BEHAVED MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD DEFINED HER TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0004 AS BOTH AN ADVENTURESS AND A BORE ADVENTURESSES USUALLY GIVING ONE MORE OF A THRILL SHE HAD EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT HER NIECE'S HAVING SELECTED SUCH A FRIEND
1069-133699-0006 MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
1069-133699-0007 I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
1069-133699-0009 AND SHE DETESTS ME FOR DETESTING IT
1069-133699-0010 MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
1069-133699-0012 RALPH WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL GENIALITY SUGGESTED BY WAY OF HEALING THE BREACH THAT THE TRUTH LAY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED AS FAIR MIDDLING
1069-133699-0013 THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
1069-133699-0015 THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR SERVANTS THE IRISH CHAMBERMAID AND THE NEGRO WAITER THEY SHARE THEIR WORK DO YOU CALL THE DOMESTICS IN AN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SLAVES MISS STACKPOLE ENQUIRED
1069-133699-0016 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0018 SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
1069-133699-0019 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
1069-133699-0021 MY DEAR FRIEND I WONDER IF YOU'RE GROWING FAITHLESS FAITHLESS FAITHLESS TO YOU HENRIETTA NO THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PAIN BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAITHLESS TO MY COUNTRY THEN
1069-133699-0022 THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
1069-133699-0024 I'VE NOT MUCH CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SAID ISABEL HENRIETTA GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE FOR A PERIOD WHICH TRIED ISABEL'S PATIENCE SO THAT OUR HEROINE ADDED AT LAST
1069-133699-0025 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0027 I COULD HAVE TALKED A LONG TIME TO SUCH A LISTENER HE WAS SO QUIET SO INTENSE HE DRANK IT ALL IN WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME ISABEL ASKED I SAID YOU WERE ON THE WHOLE THE FINEST CREATURE I KNOW
1069-133699-0028 WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
1069-133699-0030 ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
1069-133699-0031 BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
1069-133699-0033 ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
1069-133699-0034 BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
1069-133699-0036 AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
1069-133699-0037 AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
1069-133699-0039 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0040 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0042 AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
1069-133699-0043 SHE FORMED AMONG THE FLICKERING SHADOWS A GRACEFUL AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
1069-133699-0045 BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0048 SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
1069-133699-0049 YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
1069-133699-0051 ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
1069-133699-0052 I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
1069-133699-0054 CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0002 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0005 SHE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR WHAT WAS USUALLY DEEMED DECENT AND A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE RELATIONS HAD ALWAYS STRUCK HER AS A FLOWER WITHOUT FOLIAGE
1069-133709-0006 WHEN SHE SAT IN HER DAMP WATERPROOF AND SKETCHED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER TO A YOUNG PERSON OF TASTE THIS HOWEVER WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE GIRL'S OWN FAULT SHE HAD GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER AUNT'S EXPERIENCE
1069-133709-0008 BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
1069-133709-0009 SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
1069-133709-0011 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0014 ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
1069-133709-0015 WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
1069-133709-0017 IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
1069-133709-0018 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0020 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0021 RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
1069-133709-0023 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0024 ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0027 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0029 A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
1069-133709-0030 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0032 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0035 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0038 WERE SUBLIME IN THE MASS HER FORTUNE THEREFORE BECAME TO HER MIND A PART OF HER BETTER SELF IT GAVE HER IMPORTANCE GAVE HER EVEN TO HER OWN IMAGINATION A CERTAIN IDEAL BEAUTY
1069-133709-0039 WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
1069-133709-0041 LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
1069-133709-0042 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0044 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0045 SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1069-133709-0048 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0050 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BUT A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHOULD SHE HEAR FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THAT HE HAD MARRIED SOME YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO HAD DONE MORE TO DESERVE HIM
1081-125237-0000 BEFORE THE SITTINGS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY HAD COME TO AN END A YOUNG STATESMAN DESTINED TO PLAY THE LEADING PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DUTCH REPUBLIC DURING TWO DECADES HAD ALREADY MADE HIS MARK
1081-125237-0001 HIS READINESS AND PERSUASIVENESS OF SPEECH HIS INDUSTRY AND HIS GIFTS AT ONCE OF SWIFT INSIGHT AND ORDERLY THOROUGHNESS
1081-125237-0003 BUT THE ENGLISH COUNCIL HAD NOT FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION THE DEATH OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0004 APPEARED AT FIRST TO OPEN OUT A PROSPECT OF FRIENDLIER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING REPUBLICS IN JANUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE GREAT ASSEMBLY FORMALLY RECOGNISED THE COMMONWEALTH
1081-125237-0006 AND SAINT JOHN AND STRICKLAND GREETED WITH LOUD CRIES OF REGICIDES AND MANY ABUSIVE EPITHETS REMEMBERING THE FATE OF DORESLAER WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES
1081-125237-0007 ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
1081-125237-0009 THE NEGOTIATIONS CAME TO A DEADLOCK
1081-125237-0010 FOREMOST AMONGST THEM PRINCE EDWARD SON OF THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA THE PARLIAMENT THREATENED TO RECALL THE ENVOYS BUT CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN ON THE UNDERTAKING OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO PROTECT THEM FROM FURTHER ATTACKS AND TO PUNISH THE OFFENDERS
1081-125237-0012 THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBERS AND ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STEWART INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ROYAL AND THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WITH THEIR CHILDREN
1081-125237-0013 EVEN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND DARED NOT CONSIDER SUCH TERMS AND THE STATES GENERAL WOULD HAVE ANGRILY REJECTED THEM AFTER SOME FURTHER PARLEYING THEREFORE ABOUT FISHERIES AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS IT WAS FELT THAT NO AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED
1081-125237-0015 AS THEY HAD REFUSED THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM IT WAS RESOLVED THAT STRONG MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR PAST GRIEVANCES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF ENGLISH TRADE INTERESTS AT THE INSTANCE OF SAINT JOHN
1081-125237-0016 THE FAMOUS NAVIGATION ACT WAS PASSED BY THE PARLIAMENT OCTOBER NINTH SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THIS ACT STRUCK A MORTAL BLOW AT THE DUTCH CARRYING TRADE BY FORBIDDING THE IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN GOODS INTO ENGLISH PORTS EXCEPT IN ENGLISH BOTTOMS OR IN THOSE OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH HAD PRODUCED THE GOODS
1081-125237-0018 THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN HOLLAND AND THE STATES GENERAL DETERMINED TO SEND A SPECIAL EMBASSY TO LONDON
1081-125237-0019 A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0021 THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HOWEVER MET THE DUTCH COMPLAINTS BY RAKING UP THE LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES THAT HAD STIRRED UP A BITTER FEELING OF POPULAR HATRED AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES IN ENGLAND AND BY DEMANDING REPARATION
1081-125237-0022 THEY FURTHER DEMANDED THAT DUTCH COMMANDERS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENGLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY BY STRIKING FLAG AND SAIL AND BY FIRING A SALUTE WHENEVER ANY OF THEIR SQUADRONS MET ENGLISH SHIPS IN THE NARROW SEAS IT WAS THESE LAST TWO QUESTIONS
1081-125237-0024 NOT MERELY BY PRIVATEERS BUT BY AN ENGLISH SQUADRON UNDER AYSCUE IN THE WEST INDIES HAD CAUSED INTENSE INDIGNATION AND ALARM IN HOLLAND AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE STATES GENERAL AND THE ADMIRALTIES
1081-125237-0025 WHO IN PURSUANCE OF ECONOMY HAD REDUCED THE FLEET TO SEVENTY FIVE SHIPS IT WAS RESOLVED THEREFORE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND
1081-125237-0027 NOW LIEUTENANT ADMIRAL OF HOLLAND WAS SENT TO SEA WITH FIFTY SHIPS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO PROTECT DUTCH MERCHANTMEN FROM INTERFERENCE AND TO SEE THAT THE STATES SUFFERED NO AFFRONT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG
1081-125237-0028 IT CAME SUDDENLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING THE DUTCH ADMIRAL WHILE CRUISING PAST DOVER MET ON MAY TWENTY NINTH FIFTEEN ENGLISH SHIPS UNDER BLAKE
1081-125237-0030 TO THE FRENCH COAST HAVING LOST TWO SHIPS GREAT WAS THE ANGER AROUSED IN ENGLAND WHERE THE DUTCH WERE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THE AGGRESSORS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHERE THE PEACE PARTY WAS STRONG MANY WERE DISPOSED TO BLAME TROMP DESPITE HIS PROTESTS
1081-125237-0031 ADRIAN PAUW HIMSELF LEFT HASTILY FOR LONDON JOHN DE WITT BEING APPOINTED TO ACT AS HIS DEPUTY DURING HIS ABSENCE PAUW'S STRENUOUS EFFORTS HOWEVER TO MAINTAIN PEACE WERE ALL IN VAIN DESPITE THE STRONG LEANINGS OF CROMWELL TOWARDS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
1081-125237-0033 IF HUMILIATING TERMS WERE SUBMITTED TO STIFFENED THEIR ATTITUDE THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ENVOYS LEFT LONDON ON JUNE THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO AND WAR WAS DECLARED THE DUTCH STATESMEN WHO SOUGHT TO AVOID HOSTILITIES WERE RIGHT
1081-125237-0034 ALL THE ADVANTAGES WERE ON THE SIDE OF THEIR ENEMIES THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS COVERED THE SEAS AND THE WELFARE OF THE LAND DEPENDED ON COMMERCE THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE TO LOSE COMMERCIALLY
1081-125237-0036 IT HAD BEEN LARGELY INCREASED BY THE PARLIAMENT AFTER SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT AND ITS GENERALS BLAKE PENN AND AYSCUE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED MUCH VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ROYALIST SQUADRON UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
1081-125237-0037 AND IN LONG CRUISES TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORCING THE ENGLISH COLONIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE PARLIAMENTARY RULE THE CREWS THEREFORE WERE WELL TRAINED AND THE SHIPS WERE LARGER STRONGER AND BETTER ARMED THAN THOSE OF THE DUTCH
1081-125237-0039 WHEREAS IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE WERE FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY TO SOME EXTENT JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER AND NOW LACKING THE SUPREME DIRECTION OF AN ADMIRAL GENERAL THE WAR BEGAN BY A SERIES OF ENGLISH SUCCESSES AND OF DUTCH MISFORTUNES
1081-125237-0040 EARLY IN JULY SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BLAKE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SHIPS SET SAIL FOR THE NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE DUTCH BALTIC COMMERCE AND TO DESTROY THEIR FISHING FLEET OFF THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND
1081-125237-0042 ALL OF THEM BEING CAPTURED OR BURNT WHILE BLAKE WITH THE MAIN FORCE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND DESTROYED THE DUTCH FISHING FLEET AND THEIR CONVOY AFTER THESE FIRST BLOWS AGAINST THE ENEMY'S COMMERCE GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THE ENGLISH
1081-125237-0043 TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
1081-125237-0045 AND TO MEET AND CONVOY BACK THE HOME COMING SHIPS
1081-125237-0046 AYSCUE HAD PREVIOUSLY SAILED UP CHANNEL WITH FORTY MEN OF WAR AND FIVE FIRESHIPS FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE THE TWO FLEETS MET ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH AND DESPITE HIS INFERIORITY OF FORCE DE RUYTER FORCED AYSCUE TO WITHDRAW INTO PLYMOUTH AND WAS ABLE TO BRING HIS CONVOY HOME TO SAFETY
1081-125237-0048 AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
1081-125237-0049 AND WITH JOINT FORCES THEY ATTACKED BLAKE ON OCTOBER EIGHTH NEAR THE SHOAL KNOWN AS THE KENTISH KNOCK THE ENGLISH FLEET WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DUTCH AND THE DESERTION OF DE WITH BY SOME TWENTY SHIPS DECIDED THE ISSUE THE DUTCH HAD TO RETURN HOME WITH SOME LOSS
1081-125237-0051 FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
1081-125237-0052 STORMY WEATHER COMPELLED HIM TO SEND THE CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT INTO SHELTER BUT HE HIMSELF WITH SIXTY SHIPS SET OUT TO SEEK THE ENGLISH FLEET WHICH LAY IN THE DOWNS AFTER SOME MANOEUVRING THE TWO FLEETS MET ON DECEMBER TENTH OFF DUNGENESS
1081-125237-0054 AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
1081-125237-0055 HAD LASTED FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS WHEN TROMP FOUND THAT HIS POWDER HAD RUN OUT AND THAT ON THE THIRD DAY MORE THAN HALF HIS FLEET WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE BUT INSPIRING HIS SUBORDINATES DE RUYTER EVERTSEN AND FLORISZOON WITH HIS OWN INDOMITABLE COURAGE
1081-125237-0057 MEANWHILE BOTH NATIONS HAD BEEN GETTING SICK OF THE WAR THE DUTCH WERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY FROM THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR COMMERCE AND CARRYING TRADE AND FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IMPORTANT FISHERIES INDUSTRY
1081-125237-0058 WHILE THE ENGLISH ON THEIR SIDE WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE BALTIC WHERE THE KING OF DENMARK AS THE ALLY OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HAD CLOSED THE SOUND AND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ADMIRAL VAN GALEN
1081-125237-0060 AND WAS AVERSE TO WAR IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC THE STATES PARTY ESPECIALLY IN HOLLAND THE CHIEF SUFFERER BY THE WAR WAS ANXIOUS FOR A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND IT FOUND ITS LEADER IN THE YOUTHFUL JOHN DE WITT
1081-125237-0061 HAD BEEN APPOINTED COUNCIL PENSIONARY CROMWELL TOOK PAINS TO LET THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND KNOW HIS FAVOURABLE FEELINGS TOWARDS THEM BY SENDING OVER IN FEBRUARY A PRIVATE EMISSARY
1081-125237-0063 HE INDUCED THE STATES GENERAL BY A BARE MAJORITY FOUR PROVINCES TO THREE TO SEND A CONCILIATORY LETTER THE DATE OF WHICH APRIL THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE COINCIDED WITH CROMWELL'S FORCIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE RUMP PARLIAMENT AND THE ASSUMPTION BY HIM
1081-125237-0064 WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY OF DICTATORIAL POWERS
1081-125237-0066 NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
1081-125237-0067 TROMP WAS OBLIGED TO RETREAT HAVING LOST TWENTY SHIPS HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY AS DID HIS VICE ADMIRALS DE RUYTER AND DE WITH TO THE BOARD OF ADMIRALTY OF THE INFERIORITY OF THE VESSELS OF HIS FLEET AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE ADVERSARY
1081-125237-0069 FOUR ENVOYS WERE SENT REPRESENTING THE THREE MARITIME PROVINCES AT FIRST IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY COMMON GROUND OF AGREEMENT COULD BE FOUND CROMWELL WAS OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF A POLITICO RELIGIOUS UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT THE EXTINCTION OF DUTCH INDEPENDENCE
1081-125237-0070 UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
1081-125237-0072 MONK WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SHIPS LAY BETWEEN THEM TO PREVENT THEIR JUNCTION ON AUGUST FOURTH TROMP SAILED OUT AND AFTER A REARGUARD ACTION OFF KATWIJK OUT MANOEUVRED THE ENGLISH COMMANDER AND JOINED DE WITH HE NOW TURNED AND WITH SUPERIOR NUMBERS ATTACKED MONK OFF SCHEVENINGEN
1081-125237-0073 THE OLD HERO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHAT PROVED TO BE AN UNEQUAL FIGHT
1081-125237-0075 MEANWHILE NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN SLOWLY DRAGGING ON THE ACCESSION OF CROMWELL TO SUPREME POWER IN DECEMBER SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE WITH THE TITLE OF LORD PROTECTOR
1081-125237-0076 FOR THE NEW RULER OF ENGLAND HAD ALWAYS PROFESSED HIMSELF AN OPPONENT OF THE WAR WHICH HAD SHATTERED HIS FANTASTIC DREAM OF A UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS MANY CONFERENCES TOOK PLACE BUT THE PROTECTOR'S ATTITUDE AND INTENTIONS WERE AMBIGUOUS AND DIFFICULT TO DIVINE
1081-125237-0078 COMPENSATION TO BE MADE FOR THE MASSACRE OF AMBOINA AND THE OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PUNISHED THE NUMBER OF WARSHIPS IN ENGLISH WATERS WAS TO BE LIMITED THE FLAG HAD TO BE STRUCK WHEN ENGLISH SHIPS WERE MET AND THE RIGHT OF SEARCH TO BE PERMITTED THESE DEMANDS
1081-125237-0079 ARTICLE TWELVE STIPULATED THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD NOT AT ANY TIME HOLD ANY OF THE OFFICES OR DIGNITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY HIS ANCESTORS OR BE APPOINTED TO ANY MILITARY COMMAND
1081-125237-0081 AND TO BID THEM TO TREAT WITH HARSH INGRATITUDE THE INFANT HEIR OF A FAMILY TO WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE OWED SO DEEP A DEBT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PREPARE FOR A VIGOROUS RESUMPTION OF THE WAR STRONG EFFORTS WERE THEREFORE MADE AT DE WITT'S INSTIGATION
1081-125237-0082 TO INCREASE THE FLEET AND SECURE THE ACTIVE CO OPERATION OF DENMARK AND FRANCE BOTH FRIENDLY TO THE STATES BUT CROMWELL REALLY WANTED PEACE AND SHOWED HIMSELF READY TO YIELD ON CERTAIN MINOR POINTS BUT HE CONTINUED TO INSIST ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0084 HE WAS ABLE TO REACH THE PRIVATE EAR OF CROMWELL AND TO ENTER INTO CLANDESTINE NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY KNEW WELL THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THE ASSENT OF THE STATES GENERAL TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION EVEN IN A SECRET ARTICLE
1081-125237-0085 OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING ON THIS POINT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PROTECTOR GAVE THE ENVOY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ALONE WOULD AFFIRM A DECLARATION THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD NEVER BE APPOINTED STADHOLDER OR CAPTAIN GENERAL WHETHER THIS CONCESSION WAS OFFERED BY CROMWELL PROPRIO MOTU
1081-125237-0087 BUT ALSO DE WITT WAS FULLY AWARE THAT THE ASSENT OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION ARTICLE COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF A VERY PAST MASTER IN THE ART OF DIPLOMATIC CHICANERY AND INTRIGUE
1081-125237-0088 THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FIRST SET TO WORK TO HAVE THE TREATY FROM WHICH THE EXCLUSION ARTICLE HAD BEEN CUT OUT RATIFIED RAPIDLY BY THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0090 AND SUCH WAS HIS PERSUASIVE SKILL THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED THE UNPRECEDENTED FEAT OF GETTING THIS DILATORY BODY TO ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE ALMOST WITHOUT DISCUSSION
1081-125237-0091 THE TREATY RATIFIED AND SIGNED WAS SENT BACK TO LONDON ONLY ONE ARTICLE AROUSED OPPOSITION
1081-125237-0093 OR COMMANDER OF MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES
1081-125237-0094 ADDRESSED TO THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND NOT AT THE MOMENT IN SESSION
1081-125237-0096 AND THEN THE OFFICIAL LETTER FROM LONDON WAS READ TO THEM
1081-125237-0097 TO THE ACT OF EXCLUSION CAME UPON THE ESTATES LIKE A THUNDER BOLT THE SUDDEN DEMAND CAUSED SOMETHING LIKE CONSTERNATION AND THE MEMBERS ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WITH THEIR PRINCIPALS BEFORE TAKING SO MOMENTOUS A DECISION THREE DAYS WERE GRANTED
1081-125237-0099 THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS HANDS WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY WAS PEREMPTORY AND THREATENING UNLESS HE RECEIVED THE ACT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE TREATY AS NOT BINDING UPON HIM USING ALL HIS POWERS OF ADVOCACY
1081-125237-0100 DE WITT SUCCEEDED AFTER AN ANGRY DEBATE IN SECURING A MAJORITY FOR THE ACT FIVE TOWNS HOWEVER OBSTINATELY REFUSED THEIR ASSENT AND CLAIMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE PASSED WITHOUT IT BUT DE WITT HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO RISK ILLEGALITY
1081-125237-0102 BUT FOR SOME FIVE WEEKS THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACT WAS UNKNOWN TO THE STATES GENERAL AND DURING THAT PERIOD
1081-125237-0103 EARLY IN JUNE A BRIBE INDUCED ONE OF DE WITT'S CLERKS TO BETRAY THE SECRET TO COUNT WILLIAM FREDERICK THE NEWS SOON SPREAD AND LOUD WAS THE OUTCRY OF THE ORANGE PARTISANS AND OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO AT ONCE ADDRESSED A REMONSTRANCE TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0105 ALL THE SECRET INSTRUCTIONS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM HOLLAND AND THE ACT OF EXCLUSION MEANWHILE THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND THEMSELVES FRIGHTENED AT THE CLAMOUR WHICH HAD BEEN AROUSED BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF DEFECTION
1081-125237-0106 THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
1081-125237-0108 THIS WAS AGREED TO AND ON JUNE SEVENTH THE DOCUMENT WAS DULY FORWARDED TO LONDON BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0109 INFORMING THEM THAT THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ASSENTED TO THE REQUEST MADE BY THE STATES GENERAL AND THAT THEY WERE TO SEND BACK THE SECRET CORRESPONDENCE AND ALSO THE ACT IF IT WERE STILL UNDELIVERED THE RESULT ANSWERED TO HIS EXPECTATIONS
1081-125237-0111 AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
1081-125237-0112 AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0114 THERE IS HOWEVER EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DE WITT WAS PROMPTED TO TAKE THE RISKS HE DID BY PURELY PATRIOTIC MOTIVES AND NOT THROUGH SPITE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0115 NOT MERELY BY THE ORANGE PARTISANS BUT BY POPULAR OPINION GENERALLY IN THE UNITED PROVINCES

1088-129236-0000 EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
1088-129236-0002 UNITES HIM TO HIS RACE PLEDGES HIM TO THE DOMESTIC AND CIVIC RELATIONS CARRIES HIM WITH NEW SYMPATHY INTO NATURE ENHANCES THE POWER OF THE SENSES OPENS THE IMAGINATION ADDS TO HIS CHARACTER HEROIC AND SACRED ATTRIBUTES
1088-129236-0003 ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0005 AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
1088-129236-0006 FOR IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS PASSION OF WHICH WE SPEAK THOUGH IT BEGIN WITH THE YOUNG YET FORSAKES NOT THE OLD OR RATHER SUFFERS NO ONE WHO IS TRULY ITS SERVANT TO GROW OLD
1088-129236-0008 ONLY IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT BY PATIENCE AND THE MUSES AID WE MAY ATTAIN TO THAT INWARD VIEW OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL DESCRIBE A TRUTH EVER YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL SO CENTRAL THAT IT SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO THE EYE AT WHATEVER ANGLE BEHOLDEN
1088-129236-0009 AND THE FIRST CONDITION IS THAT WE MUST LEAVE A TOO CLOSE AND LINGERING ADHERENCE TO FACTS AND STUDY THE SENTIMENT AS IT APPEARED IN HOPE AND NOT IN HISTORY FOR EACH MAN SEES HIS OWN LIFE DEFACED AND DISFIGURED
1088-129236-0011 DWELL CARE AND CANKER AND FEAR WITH THOUGHT WITH THE IDEAL IS IMMORTAL HILARITY THE ROSE OF JOY ROUND IT ALL THE MUSES SING BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS AND THE PARTIAL INTERESTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
1088-129236-0012 THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
1088-129236-0014 IT IS THE DAWN OF CIVILITY AND GRACE IN THE COARSE AND RUSTIC THE RUDE VILLAGE BOY TEASES THE GIRLS ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOUSE DOOR BUT TO DAY HE COMES RUNNING INTO THE ENTRY AND MEETS ONE FAIR CHILD DISPOSING HER SATCHEL
1088-129236-0015 HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
1088-129236-0017 YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0018 THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0020 THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
1088-129236-0021 WHEN NO PLACE IS TOO SOLITARY AND NONE TOO SILENT FOR HIM WHO HAS RICHER COMPANY AND SWEETER CONVERSATION IN HIS NEW THOUGHTS THAN ANY OLD FRIENDS THOUGH BEST AND PUREST CAN GIVE HIM FOR THE FIGURES THE MOTIONS
1088-129236-0023 THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
1088-129236-0024 ALL OTHER PLEASURES ARE NOT WORTH ITS PAINS AND WHEN THE DAY WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THE NIGHT TOO MUST BE CONSUMED IN KEEN RECOLLECTIONS WHEN THE HEAD BOILED ALL NIGHT ON THE PILLOW WITH THE GENEROUS DEED IT RESOLVED ON
1088-129236-0026 A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
1088-129236-0027 HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
1088-129236-0029 THE LIKE FORCE HAS THE PASSION OVER ALL HIS NATURE IT EXPANDS THE SENTIMENT IT MAKES THE CLOWN GENTLE AND GIVES THE COWARD HEART
1088-129236-0030 INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
1088-134315-0001 THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
1088-134315-0002 TO DISTURB A RELATIONSHIP WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED WOULD BE MUTUALLY PLEASANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW GATHERCOLE WHO WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PART HE IS PLAYING TO ACT AS PEACEMAKER BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MYSELF
1088-134315-0004 KARA FOLDED THE LETTER AND INSERTED IT IN ITS ENVELOPE HE RANG A BELL ON HIS TABLE AND THE GIRL WHO HAD SO FILLED T X WITH A SENSE OF AWE CAME FROM AN ADJOINING ROOM YOU WILL SEE THAT THIS IS DELIVERED MISS HOLLAND
1088-134315-0005 A MAN AGAINST WHOM MY FAVOURITE WEAPON WOULD FAIL SHE LOOKED AT HIM WITH INTEREST IN HER EYES WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE WEAPON MISTER KARA SHE ASKED FEAR HE SAID
1088-134315-0007 WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER
1088-134315-0008 AND YOU WILL HURT HIM BEYOND FORGETFULNESS FEAR IS A TYRANT AND A DESPOT MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE RACK MORE POTENT THAN THE STAKE FEAR IS MANY EYED AND SEES HORRORS WHERE NORMAL VISION ONLY SEES THE RIDICULOUS
1088-134315-0010 WHAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE USE OF SUCH AN AWFUL WEAPON SHE ASKED IT IS AMPLY JUSTIFIED TO SECURE AN END HE SAID BLANDLY FOR EXAMPLE I WANT SOMETHING I CANNOT OBTAIN THAT SOMETHING THROUGH THE ORDINARY CHANNEL OR BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF ORDINARY MEANS
1088-134315-0011 IF I CAN BUY IT WELL AND GOOD IF I CAN BUY THOSE WHO CAN USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO SECURE THIS THING FOR ME SO MUCH THE BETTER IF I CAN OBTAIN IT BY ANY MERIT I POSSESS I UTILIZE THAT MERIT
1088-134315-0013 THAT IS A WORD I NEVER USE NOR DO I LIKE TO HEAR IT EMPLOYED HE SAID BLACKMAIL SUGGESTS TO ME A VULGAR ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MONEY
1088-134315-0014 AND ACCORDING TO YOUR ARGUMENT THEY ARE ALSO JUSTIFIED IT IS A MATTER OF PLANE HE SAID AIRILY VIEWED FROM MY STANDPOINT THEY ARE SORDID CRIMINALS THE SORT OF PERSON THAT T X MEETS I PRESUME IN THE COURSE OF HIS DAILY WORK
1088-134315-0016 HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING SMILE I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ANY PERSON SAID THE GIRL COLDLY I AM PAYING YOU THREE POUNDS A WEEK I THINK HE SAID
1088-134315-0017 I INTEND INCREASING THAT TO FIVE POUNDS BECAUSE YOU SUIT ME MOST ADMIRABLY THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY BUT I AM ALREADY BEING PAID QUITE SUFFICIENT SHE LEFT HIM A LITTLE ASTONISHED AND NOT A LITTLE RUFFLED
1088-134315-0019 HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES
1088-134315-0020 DETAIN HIM ON SOME PRETEXT OR OTHER BECAUSE HE IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET HOLD OF AND I WANT TO SEE HIM
1088-134315-0022 HE SHIVERED AS HE GLANCED INTO THE BLEAK STREET KEEP MY FIRE GOING PUT ALL MY PRIVATE LETTERS IN MY BEDROOM AND SEE THAT MISS HOLLAND HAS HER LUNCH FISHER FOLLOWED HIM TO HIS CAR WRAPPED THE FUR RUG ABOUT HIS LEGS
1088-134315-0023 CLOSED THE DOOR CAREFULLY AND RETURNED TO THE HOUSE
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1088-134315-0026 MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST
1088-134315-0029 THIS TIME HE MADE THE BEDROOM THE SCENE OF HIS INVESTIGATIONS THE SAFE HE DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TOUCH BUT THERE WAS A SMALL BUREAU IN WHICH KARA WOULD HAVE PLACED HIS PRIVATE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE MORNING THIS HOWEVER YIELDED NO RESULT
1088-134315-0031 THERE WAS A LITTLE KNOB FOR THE PURPOSE AND LET IT FALL GENTLY INTO THE SOCKET WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO RECEIVE IT ON THE DOOR ITSELF RUM COVE HE SAID AGAIN AND LIFTING THE LATCH TO THE HOOK WHICH HELD IT UP LEFT THE ROOM CLOSING THE DOOR SOFTLY BEHIND HIM
1088-134315-0032 HE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR WITH A MEDITATIVE FROWN AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STAIRS TO THE HALL HE WAS LESS THAN HALF WAY DOWN WHEN THE ONE MAID OF KARA'S HOUSEHOLD CAME UP TO MEET HIM THERE'S A GENTLEMAN WHO WANTS TO SEE MISTER KARA SHE SAID HERE IS HIS CARD
1088-134315-0034 HE WAS A MAN WHO WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED ATTENTION IF ONLY FROM THE SOMEWHAT ECCENTRIC NATURE OF HIS DRESS AND HIS UNKEMPT APPEARANCE HE WAS DRESSED IN A WELL WORN OVERCOAT OF A SOMEWHAT PRONOUNCED CHECK HE HAD A TOP HAT GLOSSY AND OBVIOUSLY NEW AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
1088-134315-0035 A PAIR OF PINCE NEZ SAT CROOKEDLY ON HIS NOSE AND TWO FAT VOLUMES UNDER HIS ARM COMPLETED THE PICTURE FISHER WHO WAS AN OBSERVER OF SOME DISCERNMENT NOTICED UNDER THE OVERCOAT A CREASED BLUE SUIT LARGE BLACK BOOTS
1088-134315-0037 EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
1088-134315-0038 AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER

1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
1098-133695-0001 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0002 FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
1098-133695-0004 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0007 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0013 HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
1098-133695-0014 OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
1098-133695-0016 HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
1098-133695-0017 IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
1098-133695-0019 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0020 IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
1098-133695-0022 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0025 IF HER GOOD HUMOUR FLAGGED AT MOMENTS IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ILL USED BUT BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY FELT SORRY FOR RALPH IT SEEMED TO HER HE WAS TALKING AS A BLIND AND HAD LITTLE HEART IN WHAT HE SAID
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0029 AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0032 WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
1098-133695-0034 AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
1098-133695-0035 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0037 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0040 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1098-133695-0041 A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
1098-133695-0043 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0044 AND NOW YOU HAD BETTER KEEP VERY QUIET AND NEVER GRUMBLE AGAIN THE SENTIMENT OF THESE REFLEXIONS WAS VERY JUST
1098-133695-0046 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0047 ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
1098-133695-0049 A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
1098-133695-0050 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0052 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0055 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0059 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0061 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0062 THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
1098-133695-0064 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0068 THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
1098-133695-0070 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
1098-133695-0071 IT MAKES ONE WANT TO BE TOUCHED MISS ARCHER LORD WARBURTON DECLARED
1098-133695-0073 HAD AT LEAST THE ELEMENT OF HUMILITY THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED BY PROOF LORD WARBURTON NOT ONLY SPENT THE NIGHT AT GARDENCOURT BUT HE WAS PERSUADED TO REMAIN OVER THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN THE SECOND DAY WAS ENDED
1098-133695-0074 HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
1098-133695-0076 WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
1098-133695-0077 THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST
1098-133695-0079 THE OCCASION WORE TO HER SENSE A FESTIVE CHARACTER AND FEASTS WERE NOT IN THE HABIT OF TERMINATING SO EARLY SO WITHOUT FURTHER THOUGHT SHE REPLIED VERY SIMPLY NEED I GO DEAR AUNT I'LL COME UP IN HALF AN HOUR
1098-133695-0080 IT'S IMPOSSIBLE I SHOULD WAIT FOR YOU MISSUS TOUCHETT ANSWERED
1098-133695-0082 ONLY I BEG IT SHALL NOT BE BEFORE MIDNIGHT
1098-133695-0083 AND TRANSFERRED THEM COLDLY TO HER NIECE
1098-133695-0085 I MUST TAKE IT AS I FIND IT CAN'T I STAY WITH MY OWN COUSIN ISABEL ENQUIRED I'M NOT AWARE THAT LORD WARBURTON IS YOUR COUSIN PERHAPS I HAD BETTER GO TO BED THE VISITOR SUGGESTED THAT WILL ARRANGE IT
1098-133695-0086 MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
1098-133695-0088 NODDED GOOD NIGHT AND WITHDREW ACCOMPANIED BY HER AUNT FOR HIMSELF HE WAS ANNOYED AT HIS MOTHER THOUGH HE THOUGHT SHE WAS RIGHT ABOVE STAIRS THE TWO LADIES SEPARATED AT MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DOOR ISABEL HAD SAID NOTHING ON HER WAY UP
1098-133695-0089 ISABEL CONSIDERED I'M NOT VEXED BUT I'M SURPRISED AND A GOOD DEAL MYSTIFIED WASN'T IT PROPER I SHOULD REMAIN IN THE DRAWING ROOM NOT IN THE LEAST YOUNG GIRLS HERE IN DECENT HOUSES
1098-133695-0091 YES I THINK I'M VERY FOND OF THEM BUT I ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW THE THINGS ONE SHOULDN'T DO SO AS TO DO THEM ASKED HER AUNT
1116-132847-0000 AND A GIRL CALLED BELLAH POSTIK THEY WERE COUSINS AND AS THEIR MOTHERS WERE GREAT FRIENDS AND CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HOUSES THEY HAD OFTEN BEEN LAID IN THE SAME CRADLE AND HAD PLAYED AND FOUGHT OVER THEIR GAMES WHEN THEY ARE GROWN UP THEY WILL MARRY SAID THE MOTHERS
1116-132847-0002 I WOULD RENT A BIT OF GROUND FROM THE MASTER AND THEN WE COULD BE MARRIED YES ANSWERED BELLAH WITH A DEEP SIGH BUT WE LIVE IN SUCH HARD TIMES AND AT THE LAST FAIR THE PRICE OF PIGS HAD RISEN AGAIN WE SHALL HAVE LONG TO WAIT
1116-132847-0003 THAT IS QUITE CLEAR REPLIED HOUARN TURNING AWAY TO HIS WORK WHENEVER THEY MET THEY REPEATED THEIR GRIEVANCES AND AT LENGTH HOUARN'S PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED AND ONE MORNING HE CAME TO BELLAH AND TOLD HER THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
1116-132847-0005 LIKE THEM I SHALL SEEK TILL I GET WHAT I WANT THAT IS MONEY TO BUY A COW AND A PIG TO FATTEN AND IF YOU LOVE ME BELLAH YOU WON'T ATTEMPT TO HINDER A PLAN WHICH WILL HASTEN OUR MARRIAGE THE GIRL SAW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE SO SHE ANSWERED SADLY
1116-132847-0006 WELL GO THEN SINCE YOU MUST BUT FIRST I WILL DIVIDE WITH YOU ALL THAT MY PARENTS LEFT ME AND GOING TO HER ROOM SHE OPENED A SMALL CHEST AND TOOK FROM IT A BELL A KNIFE AND A LITTLE STICK THIS BELL SHE SAID CAN BE HEARD AT ANY DISTANCE HOWEVER FAR
1116-132847-0008 AND THE BELL TO TELL ME OF YOUR PERILS THE STICK I SHALL KEEP FOR MYSELF SO THAT I CAN FLY TO YOU IF EVER YOU HAVE NEED OF ME THEN THEY CRIED FOR A LITTLE ON EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND HOUARN STARTED FOR THE MOUNTAINS BUT IN THOSE DAYS AS IN THESE BEGGARS ABOUNDED
1116-132847-0009 AND THROUGH EVERY VILLAGE HE PASSED THEY FOLLOWED HOUARN IN CROWDS MISTAKING HIM FOR A GENTLEMAN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO HOLES IN HIS CLOTHES THERE IS NO FORTUNE TO BE MADE HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS A PLACE FOR SPENDING AND NOT EARNING I SEE I MUST GO FURTHER
1116-132847-0011 AND THE MEN ANSWERED THAT IT WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE FAIRY THAT DWELT IN THE LAKE
1116-132847-0012 AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO BE SO MAD AND TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE IN SUCH A FOOLISH MANNER BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED
1116-132847-0014 THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND LYING ALMOST ACROSS IT WAS A LAKE WITH A NARROW OPENING TO THE SEA HOUARN PAID THE BOATMAN AND SENT HIM AWAY AND THEN PROCEEDED TO WALK ROUND THE LAKE
1116-132847-0015 AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE PREPARED TO JUMP INTO THE LAKE AND SWIM TO SHORE BUT THE BIRD HAD GUESSED HIS INTENTIONS AND PLUNGED BENEATH THE WATER
1116-132847-0017 MY NAME IS HOUARN HE ANSWERED
1116-132847-0018 AND SHE BECKONED HIM TO FOLLOW HER INTO A SECOND HALL WHOSE FLOORS AND WALLS WERE FORMED OF PEARLS WHILE DOWN THE SIDES THERE WERE TABLES LADEN WITH FRUIT AND WINES OF ALL KINDS
1116-132847-0020 THE YOUNG MAN GAZED AT HER IN SURPRISE COULD ANY ONE SO RICH AND SO BEAUTIFUL REALLY WISH TO BE HIS WIFE HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND BELLAH WAS FORGOTTEN AS HE ANSWERED A MAN WOULD BE MAD INDEED TO REFUSE SUCH AN OFFER I CAN ONLY ACCEPT IT WITH JOY
1116-132847-0021 WHEN IT WAS FULL SHE WENT INTO A LARGE KITCHEN AND THREW THEM ALL INTO A GOLDEN POT
1116-132847-0023 JUMP SHE REPLIED BUT SOON THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND LIKE CRIES WHAT IS IT ASKED HOUARN BEGINNING TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST THE CRICKETS ON THE HEARTH SAID SHE AND BROKE INTO A SONG WHICH DROWNED THE CRIES FROM THE POT
1116-132847-0024 BUT THOUGH HOUARN HELD HIS PEACE HE WAS NOT AS HAPPY AS BEFORE SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVE GONE WRONG AND THEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED BELLAH IS IT POSSIBLE I CAN HAVE FORGOTTEN HER SO SOON
1116-132847-0026 AND NO SOONER WAS THE CEREMONY OVER THAN SHE TURNED US INTO FISHES AS SHE HAD DONE TO ALL OUR FORERUNNERS WHO ARE IN THE FISH POND STILL WHERE YOU WILL SHORTLY JOIN THEM
1116-132847-0027 IT WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THAT BELLAH WHO WAS SKIMMING THE MILK IN THE FARM DAIRY HEARD THE FAIRY BELL TINKLE VIOLENTLY AT THE SOUND SHE GREW PALE FOR SHE KNEW IT MEANT THAT HOUARN WAS IN DANGER
1116-132847-0029 THE SWALLOW IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE WIND THE WIND IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE LIGHTNING BUT YOU MY HORSE IF YOU LOVE ME MUST BE SWIFTER THAN THEM ALL FOR THERE IS A PART OF MY HEART THAT SUFFERS THE BEST PART OF MY HEART THAT IS IN DANGER AND THE HORSE HEARD HER
1116-132847-0030 AND GALLOPED LIKE A STRAW CARRIED ALONG BY A TEMPEST TILL THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF A ROCK CALLED THE LEAP OF THE DEER
1116-132847-0032 AND IT IS OWING TO HER THAT I AM HERE BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS NEST I AM SITTING ON SIX EGGS OF STONE AND I SHALL NOT BE SET FREE TILL THEY ARE HATCHED
1116-132847-0033 WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HER YOU MUST CONTRIVE TO GET HOLD OF THE NET OF STEEL THAT HANGS FROM HER WAIST AND SHUT HER UP IN IT FOR EVER BUT WHERE AM I TO FIND A YOUNG MAN'S CLOTHES ASKED SHE I WILL SHOW YOU HE REPLIED
1116-132847-0035 AND WITH IT IN HER HAND SHE STEPPED INTO THE BLUE BOAT WHICH CONDUCTED HER TO THE PALACE OF SHELLS THE GROAC'H SEEMED OVERJOYED TO SEE HER AND TOLD HER THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD SHE BEHELD SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
1116-132847-0036 VERY SOON SHE LED HER VISITOR INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WINE AND FRUIT WERE ALWAYS WAITING AND ON THE TABLE LAY THE MAGIC KNIFE LEFT THERE BY HOUARN
1116-132847-0038 AND TURNING RAPIDLY FLUNG IT OVER THE WITCH'S HEAD BECOME IN BODY WHAT YOU ARE IN SOUL CRIED SHE AND IN AN INSTANT THE LOVELY FAIRY OF THE SEA WAS A TOAD HORRIBLE TO LOOK UPON SHE STRUGGLED HARD TO TEAR THE NET ASUNDER BUT IT WAS NO USE
1116-132847-0039 HER EYES FELL ON A GREEN FROG ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER HIS LITTLE PAWS CROSSED OVER HIS LITTLE HEART BELLAH FELT AS IF FINGERS WERE TIGHTENING ROUND HER THROAT BUT SHE MANAGED TO CRY IS THIS YOU MY HOUARN IS THIS YOU IT IS I CROAKED THE LITTLE FROG
1116-132851-0000 AND SHOES WITH SILVER BUCKLES THE WOMEN WERE ALL FILLED WITH ENVY BUT LITTLE CARED BARBAIK WHAT THEY MIGHT WHISPER BEHIND HER BACK AS LONG AS SHE KNEW THAT HER CLOTHES WERE FINER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND THAT SHE HAD MORE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER GIRL
1116-132851-0001 AND WHAT WAS WORSE OFTEN MADE FUN OF HIM WITH THE REST
1116-132851-0003 WHEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE GORSE CLOSE BY
1116-132851-0004 IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
1116-132851-0006 AT FIRST UNDER DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHAPES SINCE THAT TIME PARTLY FROM HABIT AND PARTLY TO AMUSE OURSELVES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES AND IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU HOW EXCLAIMED JEGU FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT
1116-132851-0007 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
1116-132851-0009 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0010 THE RACKS FILLED WITH HAY THE COWS MILKED AND THE PAILS STANDING NEATLY IN A ROW
1116-132851-0012 INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
1116-132851-0013 AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
1116-132851-0015 AND SIX NEW PIECES OF SILVER IN THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALL THIS WAS OWING TO JEGU AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS WHEN THINGS HAD REACHED THIS PASS THE BROWNIE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE HAD BETTER ASK BARBAIK TO MARRY HIM
1116-132851-0016 AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
1116-132851-0018 SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
1116-132851-0019 BARBAIK WAS FURIOUS
1116-132851-0021 WHILE NOW I CAN RECEIVE NO PRESENTS EXCEPT FROM MY HUSBAND I CAN NEVER DANCE EXCEPT WITH MY HUSBAND OH YOU WRETCHED DWARF I WILL NEVER NEVER FORGIVE YOU IN SPITE OF HER FIERCE WORDS NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN BARBAIK HOW TO PUT HER PRIDE IN HER POCKET WHEN IT SUITED HER
1116-132851-0022 AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
1116-132851-0024 BUT VERY SOON IT STRUCK HER AS ODD THAT AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROADS FULL OF PEOPLE THEY ALL LAUGHED AS THEY LOOKED AT HER HORSE AT LENGTH SHE CAUGHT SOME WORDS UTTERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER WHY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS SOLD HER HORSE'S TAIL AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
1116-132851-0025 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE HE DECLINED TO MOVE OUT OF A WALK
1116-132851-0027 WHEN ALL WAS READY THE DWARFS IN NEW GREEN SUITS CAME BUSTLING IN VERY HAPPY AND MERRY AND TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE BUT IN A MOMENT THEY ALL SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN AWAY SCREAMING FOR BARBAIK HAD PLACED PANS OF HOT COALS UNDER THEIR FEET AND ALL THEIR POOR LITTLE TOES WERE BURNT
1116-132851-0028 YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
1116-137572-0001 HIS BEAMING FACE MASKS A STIFF DETERMINATION TO KEEP HIS BRIDE HAPPY IN SPITE OF ANY WORLDLY OBSTACLES HER RADIANCE HIDES A SOLEMN INWARD VOW TO DO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SMOOTH THE WAY OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER THEY ARE RIGHT
1116-137572-0002 UNLESS THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE THIS NEW JOINT ENTERPRISE IS GOING TO MEAN MORE TO EACH OF THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE EVER CAN BEFORE THEM IS A CLEAR ROAD NOT TO HAPPINESS AS THEY MAY BELIEVE BUT TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINING HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0004 BUT THE FIRST DAYS OF MARRIAGE BRING OUT A DIFFERENT SET OF FEELINGS THOSE THAT COME WHEN ONE HAS DEFINITELY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF ANYTHING THAT BEFORE WAS ONLY PROMISED AT FIRST THE EMOTIONS SEEM TO STAND STILL THIS IS THE LONG COVETED MOMENT THEN ONE BEGINS TO APPRAISE
1116-137572-0005 IS THE OBJECT OF ONE'S WISHES AS DESIRABLE AS ONE HAD EXPECTED BECAUSE REALITY RARELY MEASURES UP TO IMAGINATION THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALMOST BOUND TO BE NO THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND THE FIRST EMOTION TENDS TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
1116-137572-0007 ROUGHLY BOTH THE HELPS AND THE HINDRANCES TO MARRIED HAPPINESS CAN BE LUMPED UNDER ONE WORD PERSONALITIES TEMPERAMENT MANNERISMS TASTES ALL THAT IS IMPLIED IN THE DISTINCT INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH PERSON MAKE UP THE CHIEF SOURCE OF THE ADVANTAGES
1116-137572-0008 AND DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COUPLE ENTER MARRIAGE THESE TRAITS CANNOT BE CHANGED OVERNIGHT NOR IS IT NECESSARY OR AT ALL WISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE JOHN ATTRACTS MARY AND SHE APPEALS TO HIM BECAUSE THE PERSONALITY OF EACH ONE IS WHAT IT IS
1116-137572-0010 LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS ALIVE IT MUST BE KEPT GROWING THROUGH EXERCISE OR IT WASTES AWAY LOVE GIVES THE PUSH THAT KEEPS A MARRIAGE MOVING BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE THE DIRECTION THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION
1116-137572-0011 THIS IS WHAT THEY MUST GUARD AGAINST WHILE LOVE IS STILL THE MOVING FORCE OF THEIR LIVES THEY MUST STUDY THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE DUE TO COME TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE BESET BY THEM IS TO BEG FOR TROUBLE
1116-137572-0013 HERE ARE NINE GUIDEPOSTS TO HELP JOHN AND MARY ALONG THEIR ROAD ONE THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS THE BUILDING OF A UNION THAT IS JUST TO BOTH THE SMALLER ISSUES ON WHICH THIS RESTS ARE THE LIVELY CLASHES OF OPPOSITE DESIRES
1116-137572-0014 INEVITABLE IN THE COMING TOGETHER OF ANY TWO PERSONS INTENSIFIED WHEN THOSE TWO PERSONS ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND UNAVOIDABLE FOR TWO COMMITTED TO A LIFETIME TOGETHER IN THE CLOSE QUARTERS OF MARRIAGE TWO
1116-137572-0016 THE CHOICE THAT BRINGS THE LARGER ADVANTAGE TO THE TWO PERSONS IN THEIR COMMON ROLE OF MARRIAGE PARTNERS IS THE ONE TO BE MADE HUMAN JUDGMENT BEING AS FAULTY AS IT IS
1116-137572-0017 IN EITHER SITUATION THE PARTICULAR COUPLE INVOLVED HAVE TO WEIGH DELICATELY THE EFFECT ON THEIR JOINT ENTERPRISE OF THE CONFLICTING COURSES OF ACTION MUCH AS MARY MAY CRAVE A CHILD OR A CAR
1116-137572-0019 REGARDLESS OF ITS EFFECT ON THE MATE IS SHORT SIGHTED IN THE EXTREME EVEN IF YOU COULD CARE ONLY FOR PERSONAL PLEASURE THAT CANNOT LONG OUTLAST YOUR SPOUSE'S DISPLEASURE STAGING A CONTEST OR A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CONTESTS FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHO IS BOSS
1116-137572-0020 BUILDS UP A HABIT OF FIGHTING THAT MAY LEAD TO A BITTER END IT IS USELESS TO DISCOVER WHO CAN WIN IN ANY PARTICULAR SKIRMISH WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN WHETHER ONE OF YOU IS SET ON BEING HEAD OF THE HOUSE IF YOUR SPOUSE CRAVES THAT DISTINCTION BY ALL MEANS HAND IT OVER WITHOUT DELAY
1116-137572-0022 NO MAN CAN AFFORD TO BE CRIPPLED FOR LIFE BY LETTING HIS WIFE SWADDLE HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AS SOME MOTHERS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION A WOMAN'S FEELING THAT SHE WILL BE EMOTIONALLY GRATIFIED BY MAKING A SACRIFICE DOES NOT PROVE THAT ASIDE FROM HER MOMENTARY PLEASURE
1116-137572-0023 ANY INDIVIDUAL WOMAN MAY WAVER BETWEEN A CRAVING FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND A REPUGNANCE TO THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT THIS CHANGEABLENESS CAN MAKE HER FEEL RESENTFUL AFTER SHE HAS GIVEN IN TO HER HUSBAND ALL THIS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING DECISIONS
1116-137572-0025 AND THE EFFORT TO DO SO TO PLEASE THE PARTNER IS LIABLE TO RESULT IN A TOPHEAVY HYPOCRISY A SUPERSTRUCTURE CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER BUT BUILT ON A SHAKY FOUNDATION OF CHAOS
1116-137572-0026 A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
1116-137572-0028 KNOWING THEMSELVES ACCEPTED THEY LOUNGE MENTALLY MANNERLY AND PHYSICALLY WHEN AT HOME OR ELSEWHERE ALONE TOGETHER SOME OF THIS RELAXATION IS A GOOD THING BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO LET HOME AND SPOUSE DEGENERATE INTO NOTHING MORE THAN AN INVITATION TO BE LAZY
1116-137572-0029 USING THE MATE FOR RELIEF AS IN NAGGING WHINING CRYING OR GRUMBLING IS TABOO IF YOU ARE TIRED OR IRRITABLE YOU CAN REST OR EXERCISE FOR RESTORATION AS IN THE DAYS BEFORE MARRIAGE
1116-137572-0031 EVEN THE GREATEST LOVE STAGNATES IF IT IS KEPT OUT OF THE MAIN CURRENT OF LIFE TO CARE ONLY FOR EACH OTHER IS SELFISHNESS FOR TWO ONLY ONE STEP REMOVED FROM SELF CENTERED ENGROSSMENT
1116-137572-0032 THIS IS WHY THE UNIQUE VALUE OF CHILDREN IS THEIR SERVICE AS AN ENTERING WEDGE IN THE CLOSE GROWN LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE A WEDGE THAT WIDENS AND HOLDS FOREVER WIDER THE UNITY OF LOVE IT HAS PENETRATED OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OTHER INTERESTS MAY SERVE A SIMILAR PURPOSE
1116-137572-0034 COMMON FRIENDS ARE FINE BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE IS SPECIAL NEED OF FRIENDS FOR EITHER SPOUSE WHO CAN CALL FORTH THOSE SIDES OF HIS OR HER NATURE THAT ARE NOT AROUSED BY THE MATE
1116-137572-0035 THE FACTOR THAT UNDERLIES ALL THE PERPLEXITIES AND MOST OF THE CONTENTMENT OF MARRIAGE IS ITS UNIQUE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATED INTIMACY HERE THE SUPREME TESTING ALWAYS COMES EACH MEANS SO MUCH TO THE OTHER
1116-137572-0037 OR BY GOING OUT WITHOUT HIS WIFE OR BY HAVING HIS FRIENDS IN WHEN SHE IS NOT AROUND FIVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF EMOTION IS WHAT COUNTS NOT THE SPECTACULAR SCALING OF PEAKS STAKING ALL ON HIGH MOMENTS IS MELODRAMA WITH NO COMIC RELIEF
1116-137572-0038 SOME HUSBANDS SOME WIVES ARE ARTISTS AT ACHIEVING AND MOMENTARILY LIVING UP TO ROMANTIC SETTINGS BUT QUICKLY FLOP DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF DECENT FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE HIGH SPOTS OF THEIR SENTIMENTAL FLARE UPS OTHERS CANNOT UTTER A POETIC PHRASE
1116-137572-0040 ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOMENT THAT IS DUE TO COME MAY SEEM EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO ARE SLIPPING SOON OR LATE YOU FIND THAT SOME FAMILIAR MANNERISM OF YOUR SPOUSE DISPLEASES YOU IT MAY BE A SLIGHT UNCOUTHNESS AT TABLE
1116-137572-0041 NOW IT VEXES YOU AND YOUR VEXATION TERRIFIES YOU DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU NO LONGER LOVE YOUR MATE AS YOU DID YOU CANNOT HELP YOUR CHANGE OF FEELING HOW THEN CAN YOU HOPE TO KEEP YOUR AFFECTION FROM DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER IF IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO WANE
1116-137572-0043 MATURITY BRINGS RECOGNITION OF HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS IN THE MOST HEROIC BUT ALSO DEVELOPS THE ABILITY TO WEIGH BIG AND LITTLE THINGS AND TO
1116-137572-0044 ALWAYS IT IS THE UNTURNED PAGE THE HOLDS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW GOES IT WITH THIS MARRIAGE THE PRESENT IS USEFUL ONLY AS A FOUNDATION STONE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH IS BEING BUILT UP OUT OF MANY FLEETING PRESENT MOMENTS EACH QUICKLY LOST IN THE PAST
1116-137572-0046 AND THE TWO PERSONS HAVE TO WORK OUT A COMMON LIFE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PLEASURE THEY MAY TAKE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AS A CONTINUING PART OF THIS LIFE ADJUSTMENT SEX ADJUSTMENT CAN DEVELOP INTO A PERMANENT FACTOR OF MARRIED HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0047 BUT WITHOUT THE LARGER ADJUSTMENT THE PARTIAL ADJUSTMENT CANNOT BE MADE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING FORM IN THE SEX LIFE IN MARRIAGE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ASSOCIATION EACH PARTNER WINS BY CONSIDERING THE OTHER BEFORE THE SELF
1116-137572-0049 IN THE HEALTHY MARRIAGE THIS SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE WILL SOON GIVE WAY TO ANGER WHICH IN TURN MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF A DASH OF COLD WATER IN THE FACE OF THE OVERSENSITIVE ONE HELPING HIM OR HER TO BUCK UP AND BEHAVE LIKE AN ADULT IN THE UNHEALTHY MARRIAGE SYMPATHY WILL GROW INTO PITY
1116-137572-0050 THE MARRIAGE PARTNER WHO IS MATURE WILL MAINTAIN TRUST IN THE OTHER'S GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE FACE OF WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE OCCASIONS FOR HURT FEELINGS A CHIEF ADVANTAGE OF THE MARRIED ESTATE IS ITS OPPORTUNITY FOR FRANKNESS WHY DOESN'T HIS WIFE TELL HIM OF THAT UNPLEASANT MANNERISM SO HE CAN CORRECT IT
1116-137572-0052 IF THE EXPRESSION OF ANGER IS TO HAVE ITS PROPER STIMULATIVE EFFECT IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED BUT RARELY AND THEN IN SMALL DOSES MORE HAS A PARALYZING EFFECT ON THE RECIPIENT
1116-137572-0053 PRODUCING A RESPONSE IN KIND THAT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY TO THINK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT RETALIATION NINE WILLINGNESS TO GROW IS THE MOST NECESSARY FACTOR FOR SUCCESS MARRIAGE IS A LIFE PROGRAM OF GOING ON TOGETHER THAT REQUIRES MATURITY
1116-137572-0055 HOPING TO KEEP THEIR MARRIAGE UNCHANGED IN ITS FIRST STAGE OF PROMISE IF BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE ACCEPT MATURING RESPONSIBILITIES AS THEY COME THEIR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP WILL KEEP PACE WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL THEREFORE BECOME INCREASINGLY SATISFYING TO THEM
1183-124566-0000 THE MASTER SAID THOUGH A MAN HAVE CONNED THREE HUNDRED POEMS IF HE STANDS HELPLESS WHEN PUT TO GOVERN

1235-135883-0000 HE WAS OBLIGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO VISIT HIS CORRESPONDENTS ON BUSINESS AND ONE DAY BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF GOING A LONG JOURNEY ON AN AFFAIR OF IMPORTANCE HE TOOK HORSE AND CARRIED WITH HIM A WALLET CONTAINING BISCUITS AND DATES
1235-135883-0002 THE FOURTH DAY OF HIS JOURNEY HE WAS SO MUCH INCOMMODED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION OF THAT HEAT FROM THE EARTH
1235-135883-0003 HAVING ALIGHTED HE TIED HIS HORSE TO A BRANCH AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FOUNTAIN TOOK SOME BISCUITS AND DATES OUT OF HIS WALLET AS HE ATE HIS DATES HE THREW THE SHELLS CARELESSLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS REPAST
1235-135883-0005 THE GENIE SPOKE TO HIM IN A TERRIBLE VOICE RISE THAT I MAY KILL THEE WITH THIS CIMETER AS THOU HAST KILLED MY SON AND ACCOMPANIED THESE WORDS WITH A FRIGHTFUL CRY
1235-135883-0006 THE MERCHANT BEING AS MUCH ALARMED AT THE HIDEOUS SHAPE OF THE MONSTER AS AT HIS THREATENING LANGUAGE ANSWERED HIM TREMBLING ALAS MY GOOD LORD OF WHAT CRIME CAN I BE GUILTY TOWARDS YOU THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE AWAY MY LIFE
1235-135883-0008 I DID ALL THAT YOU SAY ANSWERED THE MERCHANT I CANNOT DENY IT IF IT BE SO RESUMED THE GENIE I TELL THEE THAT THOU HAST KILLED MY SON AND IN THIS MANNER WHEN THOU WERT THROWING THE SHELLS ABOUT MY SON WAS PASSING BY
1235-135883-0009 AND THOU DIDST THROW ONE INTO HIS EYE WHICH KILLED HIM THEREFORE I MUST KILL THEE
1235-135883-0011 REPLIED THE MERCHANT BUT CERTAINLY I NEVER KILLED YOUR SON AND IF I HAVE IT WAS UNKNOWN TO ME AND I DID IT INNOCENTLY I BEG YOU THEREFORE TO PARDON ME AND SUFFER ME TO LIVE NO NO RETURNED THE GENIE
1235-135883-0012 PERSISTING IN HIS RESOLUTION I MUST KILL THEE SINCE THOU HAST KILLED MY SON THEN TAKING THE MERCHANT BY THE ARM HE THREW HIM WITH HIS FACE ON THE GROUND AND LIFTED UP HIS CIMETER TO CUT OFF HIS HEAD THE MERCHANT WITH TEARS
1235-135883-0014 ALL THIS WHINING SAID THE MONSTER IS TO NO PURPOSE
1235-135883-0015 WHAT EXCLAIMED THE MERCHANT CAN NOTHING PREVAIL WITH YOU WILL YOU ABSOLUTELY TAKE AWAY THE LIFE OF A POOR INNOCENT YES REPLIED THE GENIE I AM RESOLVED
1235-135883-0017 THE REMAINDER OF IT REPLIED SCHEHERAZADE IS MORE SURPRISING AND YOU WILL BE OF THIS OPINION IF THE SULTAN WILL BUT PERMIT ME TO LIVE OVER THIS DAY
1235-135883-0018 I WILL WAIT TILL TO MORROW FOR I CAN AT ANY TIME PUT HER TO DEATH WHEN SHE HAS CONCLUDED HER STORY HAVING THUS RESOLVED NOT TO PUT SCHEHERAZADE TO DEATH THAT DAY HE ROSE AND WENT TO HIS PRAYERS AND TO ATTEND HIS COUNCIL
1235-135883-0020 HE WAS AGREEABLY SURPRISED WHEN HE FOUND THE PRINCE ENTERED THE COUNCIL CHAMBER WITHOUT GIVING HIM THE FATAL ORDERS HE EXPECTED THE SULTAN ACCORDING TO HIS CUSTOM SPENT THE DAY IN REGULATING HIS AFFAIRS AND WHEN THE NIGHT HAD CLOSED IN RETIRED WITH SCHEHERAZADE
1235-135883-0021 THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE DAY DINARZADE FAILED NOT TO CALL TO HER SISTER MY DEAR SISTER IF YOU BE NOT ASLEEP I PRAY YOU TILL DAY BREAK WHICH IS VERY NEAR TO GO ON WITH THE STORY YOU BEGAN LAST NIGHT
1235-135883-0023 IN THE ORIGINAL WORK SCHEHERAZADE CONTINUALLY BREAKS OFF TO ASK THE SULTAN TO SPARE HER LIFE FOR ANOTHER DAY THAT SHE MAY FINISH THE STORY SHE IS RELATING AS THESE INTERRUPTIONS CONSIDERABLY INTERFERE WITH THE CONTINUED INTEREST OF THE STORIES IT HAS BEEN DEEMED ADVISABLE TO OMIT THEM
1235-135883-0024 FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE HOLD YOUR HAND ALLOW ME ONE WORD
1235-135883-0026 THAT THEY MAY NOT GO TO LAW AFTER MY DEATH WHEN I HAVE DONE THIS I WILL COME BACK AND SUBMIT TO WHATEVER YOU SHALL PLEASE TO COMMAND BUT SAID THE GENIE IF I GRANT YOU THE TIME YOU ASK I DOUBT YOU WILL NEVER RETURN
1235-135883-0027 IF YOU WILL BELIEVE MY OATH ANSWERED THE MERCHANT I SWEAR BY ALL THAT IS SACRED THAT I WILL COME AND MEET YOU HERE WITHOUT FAIL WHAT TIME DO YOU REQUIRE THEN DEMANDED THE GENIE
1235-135883-0029 TO PUT MYSELF INTO YOUR HANDS DO YOU TAKE HEAVEN TO BE WITNESS TO THIS PROMISE SAID THE GENIE I DO ANSWERED THE MERCHANT AND YOU MAY RELY ON MY OATH UPON THIS THE GENIE LEFT HIM NEAR THE FOUNTAIN AND DISAPPEARED
1235-135883-0030 THE MERCHANT BEING RECOVERED FROM HIS TERROR MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY
1235-135883-0032 THAT HIS FAMILY APPREHENDED SOMETHING CALAMITOUS HAD BEFALLEN HIM
1235-135883-0033 WE ARE ALL OVERJOYED SAID SHE AT YOUR RETURN BUT YOU ALARM US BY YOUR LAMENTATIONS PRAY TELL US THE CAUSE OF YOUR SORROW ALAS REPLIED THE HUSBAND I HAVE BUT A YEAR TO LIVE
1235-135883-0035 THE CHILDREN ALL IN TEARS MADE THE HOUSE RESOUND WITH THEIR GROANS AND THE FATHER NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE OF NATURE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH THEIRS SO THAT IN A WORD THEY EXHIBITED THE MOST AFFECTING SPECTACLE POSSIBLE
1235-135883-0036 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE MERCHANT APPLIED HIMSELF TO PUT HIS AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND FIRST OF ALL TO PAY HIS DEBTS HE MADE PRESENTS TO HIS FRIENDS GAVE LIBERAL ALMS TO THE POOR
1235-135883-0038 WHEN HOWEVER IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TEAR HIMSELF FROM THESE DEAR OBJECTS HE ADDRESSED THEM IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN I OBEY THE WILL OF HEAVEN IN QUITTING YOU FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE
1235-135883-0039 SUBMIT WITH FORTITUDE TO THIS NECESSITY AND CONSIDER THAT IT IS THE DESTINY OF MAN TO DIE HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE WENT OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE CRIES OF HIS FAMILY AND PURSUING HIS JOURNEY ARRIVED ON THE DAY APPOINTED
1235-135883-0041 BROTHER MAY I ASK WHY YOU ARE COME INTO THIS DESERT PLACE WHICH IS POSSESSED SOLELY BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHERE CONSEQUENTLY YOU CANNOT BE SAFE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL TREES WHICH ARE SEEN HERE ONE MIGHT INDEED SUPPOSE THE PLACE INHABITED
1235-135883-0042 HE THEN SEATED HIMSELF BY THE MERCHANT AND THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION BUT I SEE DAY SAID SCHEHERAZADE AND MUST LEAVE OFF YET THE BEST OF THE STORY IS TO COME THE SULTAN RESOLVING TO HEAR THE END OF IT
1235-135883-0044 BUT THE SULTAN WISHING TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOWED BETWIXT THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE BADE HER PROCEED WITH THAT WHICH SHE DID AS FOLLOWS SIR WHILE THE MERCHANT AND THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND WERE CONVERSING
1235-135883-0045 THEY SAW ANOTHER OLD MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM FOLLOWED BY TWO BLACK DOGS
1235-135883-0047 THEY HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO CONVERSE TOGETHER WHEN THERE ARRIVED A THIRD OLD MAN LEADING A MULE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE TWO FORMER AND ASKED WHY THE MERCHANT WHO SAT WITH THEM LOOKED SO MELANCHOLY THEY TOLD HIM THE REASON
1235-135883-0048 WHICH APPEARED TO HIM SO EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135883-0050 I WILL TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE AND OF THE HIND YOU SEE AND IF YOU THINK IT MORE WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING THAN THE ADVENTURE OF THE MERCHANT I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN A THIRD OF HIS OFFENCE
1235-135884-0000 WHAT IS MORE MY WIFE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN I MARRIED HER SO THAT I MAY JUSTLY SAY SHE OUGHT TO REGARD ME EQUALLY AS HER FATHER HER KINSMAN AND HER HUSBAND
1235-135884-0002 MY DESIRE OF HAVING CHILDREN ONLY INDUCED ME TO PURCHASE A SLAVE BY WHOM I HAD A SON WHO WAS EXTREMELY PROMISING MY WIFE BEING JEALOUS CHERISHED A HATRED FOR BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0003 BUT CONCEALED HER AVERSION SO WELL THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS TOO LATE MEAN TIME MY SON GREW UP AND WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE A LONG JOURNEY
1235-135884-0005 SHE HOWEVER EMPLOYED THAT TIME TO SATISFY HER HATRED SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO MAGIC
1235-135884-0006 THE WRETCH CARRIED MY SON TO A DESOLATE PLACE WHERE BY HER ENCHANTMENTS SHE CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AND GAVE HIM TO MY FARMER TO FATTEN PRETENDING SHE HAD BOUGHT HIM
1235-135884-0008 YOUR SLAVE SAID SHE IS DEAD AND AS FOR YOUR SON I KNOW NOT WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THIS TWO MONTHS I WAS AFFLICTED AT THE DEATH OF THE SLAVE
1235-135884-0009 BUT AS SHE INFORMED ME MY SON HAD ONLY DISAPPEARED I WAS IN HOPES HE WOULD SHORTLY RETURN HOWEVER EIGHT MONTHS PASSED AND I HEARD NOTHING OF HIM WHEN THE FESTIVAL OF THE GREAT BAIRAM WAS TO BE CELEBRATED
1235-135884-0011 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135884-0012 AND RESISTING AN ORDER WHICH DISAPPOINTED HER MALICE SHE CRIED OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUSBAND SACRIFICE THAT COW YOUR FARMER HAS NOT A FINER NOR ONE FITTER FOR THE FESTIVAL OUT OF DEFERENCE TO MY WIFE I CAME AGAIN TO THE COW
1235-135884-0014 I THEN PUT THE MALLET INTO THE FARMER'S HANDS AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE IT AND SACRIFICE HER HIMSELF FOR HER TEARS AND BELLOWING PIERCED MY HEART THE FARMER LESS COMPASSIONATE THAN MYSELF SACRIFICED HER
1235-135884-0015 THOUGH TO SHE SEEMED VERY FAT TAKE HER YOURSELF SAID I TO HIM
1235-135884-0017 AS SOON AS HE BEHELD ME HE MADE SO GREAT AN EFFORT TO COME NEAR ME THAT HE BROKE HIS CORD
1235-135884-0018 WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND AS IF HE MEANT TO EXCITE MY COMPASSION CONJURING ME NOT TO BE SO CRUEL AS TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND DID AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SIGNIFY THAT HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0020 GO SAID I TO THE FARMER CARRY HOME THAT CALF TAKE GREAT CARE OF HIM AND BRING ME ANOTHER IN HIS STEAD IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS MY WIFE HEARD ME GIVE THIS ORDER SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HUSBAND
1235-135884-0021 TAKE MY ADVICE SACRIFICE NO OTHER CALF BUT THAT WIFE I REPLIED I WILL NOT SACRIFICE HIM I WILL SPARE HIM AND PRAY DO NOT YOU OPPOSE ME
1235-135884-0023 WHEN TURNING HIS EYES BATHED WITH TEARS IN A LANGUISHING MANNER TOWARDS ME HE AFFECTED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAD NOT STRENGTH TO KILL HIM I LET THE KNIFE FALL AND TOLD MY WIFE POSITIVELY
1235-135884-0024 THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
1235-135884-0026 THESE TWO METAMORPHOSES WERE MADE BY THE ENCHANTMENTS OF OUR MASTER'S WIFE WHO HATED BOTH THE MOTHER
1235-135884-0027 THIS IS WHAT MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME SAID THE FARMER AND I COME TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH IT I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE HOW MUCH I WAS SURPRISED I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MY FARMER TO SPEAK TO HIS DAUGHTER MYSELF
1235-135884-0029 MY GOOD MAID SAID I CAN YOU RESTORE MY SON TO HIS FORMER SHAPE YES SHE REPLIED I CAN
1235-135884-0030 EXCEPT ON TWO CONDITIONS THE FIRST IS THAT YOU GIVE HIM TO ME FOR MY HUSBAND AND THE SECOND THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO PUNISH THE PERSON WHO CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AS TO THE FIRST I REPLIED
1235-135884-0032 ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
1235-135884-0033 PROVIDED YOU FIRST OF ALL RESTORE TO ME MY SON
1235-135884-0035 BUT IF THOU BE A MAN AND ART CHANGED INTO A CALF BY ENCHANTMENT RETURN TO THY NATURAL SHAPE BY THE PERMISSION OF THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR AS SHE SPOKE SHE THREW WATER UPON HIM
1235-135884-0036 AND IN AN INSTANT HE RECOVERED HIS NATURAL FORM MY SON
1235-135884-0038 BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
1235-135884-0039 I DESIRED SHE MIGHT HAVE THIS SHAPE RATHER THAN ANOTHER LESS AGREEABLE THAT WE MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FAMILY WITHOUT HORROR SINCE THAT TIME MY SON IS BECOME A WIDOWER AND GONE TO TRAVEL
1235-135884-0041 THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MYSELF AND THIS HIND IS IT NOT ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING I ADMIT IT IS SAID THE GENIE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT FORGIVE THE MERCHANT ONE THIRD OF HIS CRIME
1235-135887-0000 THE STORY OF THE GRECIAN KING
1235-135887-0002 ARRIVED AT HIS COURT THIS PHYSICIAN HAD LEARNT THE THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREEK PERSIAN TURKISH ARABIC LATIN SYRIAC AND HEBREW BOOKS HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
1235-135887-0003 I KNOW SAID HE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIALS THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S PHYSICIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEAL YOU OF THE LEPROSY BUT IF YOU WILL ACCEPT MY SERVICE I WILL ENGAGE TO CURE YOU WITHOUT POTIONS
1235-135887-0005 DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
1235-135887-0006 AND TO MORROW WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED TO HIS QUARTERS MADE A HOLLOW MACE AND AT THE HANDLE HE PUT IN HIS DRUGS
1235-135887-0008 AND AFTER A PROFOUND REVERENCE SAID TO THE KING HE JUDGED IT MEET THAT HIS MAJESTY SHOULD TAKE HORSE
1235-135887-0009 THE KING DID SO AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM WITH THE MACE AND SAID EXERCISE YOURSELF WITH THIS MACE AND STRIKE THE BALL UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR HANDS AND BODY PERSPIRE
1235-135887-0011 IMMEDIATELY ON YOUR RETURN TO YOUR PALACE GO INTO THE BATH AND CAUSE YOURSELF TO BE WELL WASHED AND RUBBED THEN RETIRE TO BED AND WHEN YOU RISE TO MORROW YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF CURED
1235-135887-0012 THE KING TOOK THE MACE AND STRUCK THE BALL WHICH WAS RETURNED BY HIS OFFICERS WHO PLAYED WITH HIM HE PLAYED SO LONG THAT HIS HANDS AND HIS WHOLE BODY WERE IN A SWEAT AND THEN THE MEDICINE SHUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE HAD ITS OPERATION
1235-135887-0014 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AROSE HE PERCEIVED WITH EQUAL WONDER AND JOY THAT HIS LEPROSY WAS CURED AND HIS BODY AS CLEAN AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN AFFECTED AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE CAME INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE WHERE HE ASCENDED HIS THRONE
1235-135887-0015 AND SHEWED HIMSELF TO HIS COURTIERS WHO EAGER TO KNOW THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICINE CAME THITHER BETIMES AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING PERFECTLY CURED EXPRESSED GREAT JOY
1235-135887-0017 BUT AS HE TREATED ALL HIS COURT THAT DAY MADE HIM EAT AT HIS TABLE ALONE WITH HIM
1235-135887-0018 BUT CAUSED HIM TO BE CLAD IN A RICH ROBE
1235-135887-0020 HE COULD NOT BEHOLD WITHOUT ENVY THE PRESENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE PHYSICIAN WHOSE OTHER MERITS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
1235-135887-0021 TO EFFECT THIS HE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM IN PRIVATE THAT HE HAD SOME INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMMUNICATE THE KING HAVING ASKED WHAT IT WAS SIRE SAID HE
1235-135887-0023 I AM WELL INFORMED OF WHAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO REVEAL TO YOUR MAJESTY THEREFORE DO NOT REST IN DANGEROUS SECURITY IF YOUR MAJESTY BE ASLEEP BE PLEASED TO AWAKE
1235-135887-0024 AND CAME TO SETTLE HIMSELF AT YOUR COURT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXECUTING THE HORRIBLE DESIGN WHICH I HAVE INTIMATED NO NO VIZIER INTERRUPTED THE KING
1235-135887-0026 IF HE HAD HAD A DESIGN UPON MY LIFE WHY DID HE SAVE ME THEN HE NEEDED ONLY TO HAVE LEFT ME TO MY DISEASE I COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED IT AS LIFE WAS FAST DECAYING FORBEAR THEN TO FILL ME WITH UNJUST SUSPICIONS
1235-135887-0027 INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU I TELL YOU THAT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD I WILL GIVE THAT GREAT MAN A PENSION OF A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD PER MONTH FOR HIS LIFE NAY THOUGH I WERE TO SHARE WITH HIM ALL MY RICHES AND DOMINIONS
1235-135887-0029 TO PREVENT HIS PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRINCE HIS SON WHAT THE GRECIAN KING SAID ABOUT KING SINBAD RAISED THE VIZIER'S CURIOSITY WHO SAID I PRAY YOUR MAJESTY TO PARDON ME
1235-135887-0030 IF I HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO ASK WHAT THE VIZIER OF KING SINBAD SAID TO HIS MASTER TO DIVERT HIM FROM PUTTING THE PRINCE HIS SON TO DEATH THE GRECIAN KING HAD THE CONDESCENSION TO SATISFY HIM THAT VIZIER SAID HE

1246-124548-0042 A RED HEADED YOUNG MAN WHO SMOKED CIGARETTES IN A LONG AMBER HOLDER CAROL READ THE BOOKLET WITH A CERTAIN WONDER
1246-124548-0043 SHE LEARNED THAT PLOVER AND MINNIEMASHIE LAKES WERE WORLD FAMED FOR THEIR BEAUTEOUS WOODED SHORES AND GAMEY PIKE AND BASS NOT TO BE EQUALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE RESIDENCES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WERE MODELS
1246-124548-0045 BEST FLOUR IN THE COUNTRY THAT THE SURROUNDING FARM LANDS WERE RENOWNED
1246-124548-0046 AND THAT THE STORES IN GOPHER PRAIRIE COMPARED FAVORABLY WITH MINNEAPOLIS AND CHICAGO IN THEIR ABUNDANCE OF LUXURIES AND NECESSITIES AND THE EVER COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF THE SKILLED CLERKS SHE LEARNED IN BRIEF
1246-124548-0048 KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
1246-124548-0049 SHE COULD NOT FEEL THAT HIS COMING MUCH MATTERED AND A YEAR AFTER WHEN HE FAILED SHE COULD NOT BE VERY SORROWFUL

1246-124550-0000 THOUGH THE ARMISTICE WITH GERMANY WAS SIGNED A FEW WEEKS AFTER HER COMING TO WASHINGTON THE WORK OF THE BUREAU CONTINUED SHE FILED CORRESPONDENCE ALL DAY THEN SHE DICTATED ANSWERS TO LETTERS OF INQUIRY IT WAS AN ENDURANCE OF MONOTONOUS DETAILS
1246-124550-0002 A FREE SUNDAY IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT WORLD NEEDED HER INSPIRATION BUT SHE FELT THAT HER LETTERS HER CONTACT WITH THE ANXIETIES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE A PART OF VAST AFFAIRS
1246-124550-0003 NOT CONFINED TO MAIN STREET AND A KITCHEN BUT LINKED WITH PARIS BANGKOK MADRID SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE COULD DO OFFICE WORK WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THE PUTATIVE FEMININE VIRTUE OF DOMESTICITY THAT COOKING AND CLEANING
1246-124550-0005 WHITE COLUMNS SEEN ACROSS LEAFY PARKS SPACIOUS AVENUES TWISTY ALLEYS DAILY SHE PASSED A DARK SQUARE HOUSE WITH A HINT OF MAGNOLIAS AND A COURTYARD BEHIND IT AND A TALL CURTAINED SECOND STORY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH A WOMAN WAS ALWAYS PEERING
1246-124550-0006 THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0008 AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
1246-124550-0009 AS SHE GLANCED UP THE ELM ALLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AS SHE WAS RESTED BY THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE SHE LOVED THE CITY AS SHE LOVED NO ONE SAVE HUGH SHE ENCOUNTERED NEGRO SHANTIES TURNED INTO STUDIOS

1246-124550-0014 PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
1246-124550-0015 ALWAYS SHE WAS TO PERCEIVE IN WASHINGTON AS DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN NEW YORK OR LONDON A THICK STREAK OF MAIN STREET THE CAUTIOUS DULLNESS OF A GOPHER PRAIRIE APPEARED IN BOARDING HOUSES WHERE LADYLIKE BUREAU CLERKS
1246-124550-0017 CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
1246-124550-0018 INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
1246-124550-0020 SCORES OF THEM SITTING ABOUT THE FLAT TALKING TALKING TALKING NOT ALWAYS WISELY BUT ALWAYS EXCITEDLY IT WAS NOT AT ALL THE ARTIST'S STUDIO OF WHICH BECAUSE OF ITS PERSISTENCE IN FICTION SHE HAD DREAMED
1246-124550-0021 BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
1246-124550-0023 DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
1246-124550-0024 THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
1246-124550-0026 THAT INSTITUTION IS RESERVED FOR MEN LIKE KENNICOTT WHO AFTER DEVOTING FIFTY YEARS TO PUTTING ASIDE A STAKE INCONTINENTLY INVEST THE STAKE IN SPURIOUS OIL STOCKS
1246-124550-0027 SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
1246-124550-0029 FROM HER TEACHER HOUSEMATE SHE HAD A SARDONIC DESCRIPTION OF A MIDDLEWESTERN RAILROAD DIVISION TOWN OF THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT DEVOID OF LAWNS AND TREES A TOWN WHERE THE TRACKS SPRAWLED ALONG THE CINDER SCABBED MAIN STREET AND THE RAILROAD SHOPS

1246-124550-0032 SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
1246-124550-0033 A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
1246-124550-0035 UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
1246-124550-0036 BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE

1263-138246-0022 THERE THE THREE TRAVELERS WERE TO STRETCH THEMSELVES SOME MOMENTS BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE DURING THIS TIME ARDAN NOT BEING ABLE TO KEEP STILL TURNED IN HIS NARROW PRISON LIKE A WILD BEAST IN A CAGE
1263-138246-0024 HE EXCLAIMED TEASING THEM SO YOU ARE GOING TO SHOW THE MOON DOGS THE GOOD HABITS OF THE DOGS OF THE EARTH THAT WILL DO HONOR TO THE CANINE RACE IF EVER WE DO COME DOWN AGAIN
1263-138246-0025 I WILL BRING A CROSS TYPE OF MOON DOGS WHICH WILL MAKE A STIR IF THERE ARE DOGS IN THE MOON SAID BARBICANE THERE ARE SAID MICHEL ARDAN JUST AS THERE ARE HORSES COWS
1263-138246-0027 THIRTY SEVEN MINUTES SIX SECONDS PAST TEN IT IS UNDERSTOOD CAPTAIN WELL BEFORE ANOTHER QUARTER OF AN HOUR YOU WILL HAVE TO COUNT NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE PRESIDENT
1263-138246-0028 FOUR THOUSAND BECAUSE THE COLUMBIAD WILL NOT BURST AND FIVE THOUSAND BECAUSE THE PROJECTILE WILL RISE MORE THAN SIX MILES IN THE AIR
1263-138246-0030 AND WHY ASKED NICHOLL BECAUSE IF YOU GAIN THE FIRST THE COLUMBIAD WILL HAVE BURST AND THE PROJECTILE WITH IT AND BARBICANE WILL NO LONGER BE THERE TO REIMBURSE YOUR DOLLARS MY STAKE IS DEPOSITED AT THE BANK IN BALTIMORE
1263-138246-0031 REPLIED BARBICANE SIMPLY AND IF NICHOLL IS NOT THERE IT WILL GO TO HIS HEIRS AH YOU PRACTICAL MEN EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN I ADMIRE YOU THE MORE FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND YOU
1263-138246-0033 HIS EYE FIXED ON THE NEEDLE HIS FINGER ON THE ELECTRIC APPARATUS IS COUNTING THE SECONDS PREPARATORY TO LAUNCHING US INTO INTERPLANETARY SPACE ENOUGH MICHEL ENOUGH
1263-138246-0034 SAID BARBICANE IN A SERIOUS VOICE LET US PREPARE
1263-138246-0036 BARBICANE QUICKLY PUT OUT THE GAS AND LAY DOWN BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE PROFOUND SILENCE WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE TICKING OF THE CHRONOMETER MARKING THE SECONDS
1263-139804-0000 SUSTAINS THE SHORTEST LIVED HUMAN BEINGS OF OUR UNIVERSE IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY OF THE CREATURES REACH MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS OF TIME
1263-139804-0002 AND ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING REGULAR INSTRUCTION AT THE AGE OF FIVE MONTHS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THIS SPHERE WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL CALL BRIEF
1263-139804-0003 REVOLVES VERY SLOWLY ON ITS AXIS SO THAT OUR WORLD MAKES FIFTEEN TIMES AS MANY REVOLUTIONS AS THIS PLANET IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE ARITHMETIC TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF DO NOT SEE THE SUN RISE VERY OFTEN
1263-139804-0005 EARLY IN THE MORNING CERTAIN CROPS ARE PLANTED AND ARE HARVESTED AT NIGHT TWO OR MORE DAYS ARE REQUIRED FOR MATURING OTHER CROPS ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF RAISE THEIR CROPS WITH LESS LABOR THAN IS REQUIRED AMONGST US
1263-139804-0006 IF YOU WERE PERMITTED TO LOOK UPON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORLD YOUR FIRST SENSATION WOULD BE DIZZINESS NOT TO MENTION THE WEIRDNESS OF ALL SIGHTS THAT WOULD CONFRONT YOU AT EVERY TURN
1263-139804-0008 THERE BEING NO COMPETITION NO TIME OR SPACE IS REQUIRED FOR SENSATIONAL TRASH THUS IF NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURS NOTHING NEED BE TRANSMITTED THE OFFICIAL NEWS CENSORS DECIDE AS TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OCCURRENCES
1263-139804-0009 THERE NEED NOT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NEWS TELEGRAPHED EACH HOUR THE GOVERNMENT VERIFIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL REPORTS BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSMITTED THERE ARE INDEED SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH HOME UNDER ITS CARE
1263-139804-0011 THEY NEVER THINK OF COVERING THE FEET UNDER ANY CHANGE OF CLIMATE IF ONE OF THE BRIEFITES WERE TO STEP UPON THE SHORES OF OUR RUGGED EARTH AND SEE THE COTTON OR WOOL AND LEATHER THAT LIES AROUND OUR FEET IT WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IMAGINABLE
1263-139804-0012 NEITHER THE MEN WOMEN NOR CHILDREN SEEM TO SEEK THIS MEANS FOR SELF BEAUTIFYING THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BEAUTY OF CHARACTER HAS A RADIANCE MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THE FLASH OF OPALS OR THE LUSTER OF SILKS THEIR GARMENTS PARTAKE OF THE LOOSE FLOWING ORDER
1263-139804-0014 TRANSPORTATION THE METHODS OF TRAVELING ARE SO CONTRARY TO OUR CONCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT I ALMOST FORBEAR TO ATTEMPT ANY DESCRIPTION
1263-139804-0015 WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
1263-139804-0017 AND THEN ANOTHER WILD DASH I HAVE NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR THIS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE BRIEFITES CAN COVER CONSIDERABLE TERRITORY IN AN HOUR THEY LOOK UPON THIS GRAVITY SYSTEM AS A WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1263-139804-0018 THE POWER OF STEAM HAS NEVER BEEN UTILIZED NO GENIUS OF ALL THIS ACTIVE WORLD OF BRIEF EVER CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER LIES WRAPPED UP IN THIN VAPORY WATER BUT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL GASEOUS OIL
1263-139804-0020 AND THAT HE PROPHESIED GREAT CHANGES WHEN HIS GAS PROPELLED VEHICLE WAS PERFECTED THINK OF HOW MUCH VALUE AN ORDINARY CITIZEN OF OUR WORLD WOULD BE TO THESE BRIEFITES IF HE COULD STEP UPON THEIR WORLD AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM CONCERNING THE MAGIC WONDERS OF STEAM
1263-139804-0021 AND THE MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING STATIONARY AND MOVABLE ENGINES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HIDDEN WONDERS OF ELECTRICITY QUADRUPEDS THAT TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR HORSES ARE USED FOR DRAYAGE ALTHOUGH NOTHING EXCEPT THE TWO WHEELED CLASS OF VEHICLES WAS EVER USED UNTIL SOME EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS AGO
1263-139804-0023 IN ALL MY VAST JOURNEY AMONG THE WORLDS I FOUND ONLY A FEW COMPARATIVELY WHEREON THE ROADS WERE INFERIOR TO OURS IN THE WORLD OF BRIEF THE STATE PRESCRIBES THE MANNER OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND EACH CITIZEN MUST CONTRIBUTE HIS SHARE TO THEIR CREATION AND MAINTENANCE
1263-139804-0024 VERY INTRICATE AND ELABORATE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BY THESE PEOPLE OF A FEW YEARS THEY ARE INFERIOR TO US IN A HUNDRED WAYS IN THE BROAD FIELDS OF MANUFACTURE AND INVENTION THEY LAG A LONG DISTANCE IN THE REAR THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TIME
1263-139804-0026 THE MOST FAITHFUL TRANSLATION OF THIS WORD INTO OUR LANGUAGE WOULD BE GOD AFFLUENCE KERM CHER OR GOD BREATH APPEARED UPON BRIEF FULL GROWN
1263-139804-0027 SIMILAR TO CHRIST HE CONFIRMED HIS IDENTITY BY UNANSWERABLE MIRACLES MANY HOWEVER DISBELIEVED IN KERM CHER AND HELD TO THE OLD AXIOMATIC TRUTHS THUS CREEDS WERE PREVALENT AND THEY REMAIN UNTIL NOW
1263-139804-0029 AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
1263-141777-0000 MOISTURE FROM THE NIGHT'S RAIN HUNG ON THE TREE LEAVES CLUNG IN GLOBULES TO RYNCH'S SWEATING BODY HE LAY ON A WIDE BRANCH TRYING TO CONTROL THE HEAVY PANTING WHICH SUPPLIED HIS LABORING LUNGS
1263-141777-0002 THEY WOULD TAKE HIM OUT OF THE LONELINESS OF A WORLD HERETOFORE EMPTY OF HIS SPECIES BUT THAT TALL MAN THE ONE WHO HAD LED THE PARTY INTO THE IRREGULAR CLEARING ABOUT THE LIFE BOAT RYNCH SHIVERED
1263-141777-0003 DUG HIS NAILS INTO THE WOOD ON WHICH HE LAY AT THE SIGHT OF THAT MAN DREAM AND REALITY HAD CRASHED TOGETHER SENDING HIM INTO PANIC STRICKEN FLIGHT THAT WAS THE MAN FROM THE ROOM
1263-141777-0005 THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0008 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0009 NONE CAME AND HE DARED TO SLIP AROUND THE BOLE OF THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR ANY CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OVERHEAD NOW HE WAS FACING THAT SURVIVOR'S CAMP
1263-141777-0011 AND THE SENSE ORGANS OF EYES AND NOSE SQUEEZED TOGETHER ON THE LOWER QUARTER OF THE ROUNDED PORTION WITH A LINE OF WIDE MOUTH TO SPLIT THE BLUNT ROUND OF THE MUZZLE DARK PITS FOR EYES SHOWED NO PUPIL IRIS OR CORNEA
1263-141777-0012 THE NOSE WAS A BLACK PERFECTLY ROUNDED TUBE JUTTING AN INCH OR SO BEYOND THE CHEEK SURFACE GROTESQUE ALIEN AND TERRIFYING IT MADE NO HOSTILE MOVE AND SINCE IT HAD NOT TURNED ITS HEAD HE COULD NOT BE SURE IT HAD EVEN SIGHTED HIM
1263-141777-0014 CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TREE MINUTES LATER HE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO OF THE BEASTS WAITING QUIETLY ABOUT THE CAMP AND THAT THEIR SENTRY LINE RAN BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLEARING OF THE L B HE WITHDREW FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
1263-141777-0015 INTENT UPON FINDING A DETOUR WHICH WOULD BRING HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN LANDS NOW HE WANTED TO JOIN FORCES WITH HIS OWN KIND WHETHER THOSE MEN WERE POTENTIAL ENEMIES OR NOT AS TIME PASSED THE BEASTS CLOSED ABOUT THE CLEARING OF THE CAMP
1263-141777-0017 RYNCH WENT FLAT ON THE STREAM BANK MADE A WORM'S PROGRESS UP THE SLOPE TO CROUCH BEHIND A BUSH AND SURVEY THE LAND IMMEDIATELY AHEAD THERE STOOD AN OFF WORLD SPACER FINS DOWN NOSE SKYWARD
1263-141777-0018 AND GROUPED NOT TOO FAR FROM ITS LANDING RAMP A COLLECTION OF BUBBLE TENTS A FIRE BURNED IN THEIR MIDST AND MEN WERE MOVING ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE WOOD AND ITS WATCHERS AND HAD COME SO NEAR TO HIS GOAL
1263-141777-0020 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0021 THAT IDEA MADE SENSE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LET THE OTHER PAST HIM FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND UNTIL HE WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CAMP SO THAT HIS FRIENDS COULD NOT INTERFERE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING
1263-141777-0023 SO STARTLED THAT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY FOR A SECOND THEN HE NOTED THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE OTHER'S BODY WAS VISIBLE GROWING BRIGHTER BY THE MOMENT MINUTE PARTICLES OF PALE GREENISH RADIANCE WERE GATHERING ABOUT THE OTHER THE DARK SHADOW OF AN ARM FLAPPED THE RADIANCE SWIRLED
1263-141777-0024 BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
1263-141777-0026 NOT A BEAST'S CRY OR WAS IT AGAIN THOSE FINGERS MOVED ON THE PANEL WAS THE OTHER SENDING A MESSAGE BY THAT MEANS RYNCH WATCHED HIM CHECK THE WEBBING COUNT THE EQUIPMENT AT HIS BELT SETTLE THE NEEDLER IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
1263-141777-0027 HOWEVER THE OTHER WAS AS WARY OF THAT DARK AS IF HE SUSPECTED WHAT MIGHT LIE IN WAIT THERE HE ANGLED ALONG NORTHWARD AVOIDING CLUMPS OF SCATTERED BRUSH KEEPING IN THE OPEN WHERE RYNCH DARED NOT TAIL HIM TOO CLOSELY
1263-141777-0029 THANKFULLY RYNCH FOUND HIS OWN LURKING PLACE FROM WHICH HE COULD KEEP THE OTHER IN SIGHT THE LIGHT POINTS GATHERED HUNG IN A SMALL LUMINOUS CLOUD OVER THE ROCKS BUT RYNCH HAD PRUDENTLY WITHDRAWN UNDER A BUSH
1263-141777-0030 AND THE SCENT OF ITS AROMATIC LEAVES MUST HAVE DISCOURAGED THE SPARKS FOR NO SUCH CROWN CAME TO HIS SENTRY POST DRUGGED WITH FATIGUE THE YOUNGER MAN SLEPT AWAKING TO FULL DAY A FOG OF BEWILDERMENT
1263-141777-0032 IN FACT IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM THAT HE HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO LEAVE BOOT PRINTS ON FAVORABLE STRETCHES OF GROUND DID HE GUESS THAT RYNCH LURKED BEHIND WAS NOW LEADING HIM ON FOR SOME PURPOSE OF HIS OWN
1263-141777-0033 OR WERE THOSE TRACES LEFT TO GUIDE ANOTHER PARTY FROM THE CAMP TO ADVANCE OPENLY UP THE STREAM BED WAS TO INVITE DISCOVERY RYNCH SURVEYED THE NEARER BANK CLUMPS OF SMALL TREES AND HIGH GROWING BUSHES DOTTED THAT EXPANSE AN IDEAL COVER
1263-141777-0035 THREE RED BODIES WERE FLAT AND STILL ON THE GRAVEL AS THE OFF WORLDER LEANED BACK AGAINST A ROCK BREATHING HEAVILY AS RYNCH SIGHTED HIM HE STOOPED TO RECOVER THE NEEDLER HE HAD DROPPED LURCHED AWAY FROM THE ROCK TOWARDS THE WATER
1263-141777-0036 CLAWED AT THE GROUND ABOUT HIM ALREADY HE WAS BURIED TO HIS KNEES THEN HIS MID THIGHS IN THE ARTIFICIAL QUICKSAND BUT HE HAD NOT LOST HIS HEAD AND WAS JERKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN AN EFFORT TO PULL FREE RYNCH GOT TO HIS FEET
1263-141777-0038 BUT NOW AS HE SIGHTED RYNCH HIS EYES WIDENED AND HIS LIPS PARTED THE BOX ON HIS CHEST CAUGHT ON A STONE HE HAD DRAGGED TO HIM IN A DESPERATE TRY FOR SUPPORT
1263-141777-0039 THERE WAS A SPITTING OF SPARKS AND THE STRANGER WORKED FRANTICALLY AT THE BUCKLE OF THE WEBBING HARNESS TO LOOSEN IT AND TOSS THE WHOLE THING FROM HIM THE BOX STRUCK ONE OF THE DEAD WATER CATS FLASHED AS FUR AND FLESH WERE SINGED
1263-141777-0041 SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED
1334-135589-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN BUT WE MUST FOLLOW EDWARD FOR A TIME ON HIS ARRIVAL AT PARIS HE WAS KINDLY RECEIVED BY KING CHARLES WHO PROMISED TO ASSIST HIS VIEWS IN JOINING THE ARMY

1334-135589-0026 WAS MET AT DOVER BY GENERAL MONK AND CONDUCTED TO LONDON WHICH HE ENTERED AMID THE ACCLAMATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE TWENTY NINTH OF THE SAME MONTH WE MAY LEAVE THE READER TO SUPPOSE THAT EDWARD

1334-135589-0039 WHICH IT GAVE TO EDWARD TO FIND HIS SISTERS GROWN SUCH ACCOMPLISHED AND ELEGANT YOUNG WOMEN THAT HIS TWO FRIENDS WHO WERE AS THE READER WILL RECOLLECT OLD ACQUAINTANCES OF ALICE AND EDITH WERE WARMLY RECEIVED WE HARDLY NEED SAY

1334-135589-0045 HOW CAN YOU SAY SO EDWARD YOU RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTERS A LONG WHILE AGO YES I DID BUT LET US NOT TALK ABOUT IT ANY MORE MY DEAR EDITH I AM IN GREAT PERPLEXITY
1334-135589-0047 AND FEEL THAT ALL HE ASSERTED TO HUMPHREY IS TRUE STILL I DO NOT LIKE THAT I SHOULD BE INDEBTED TO HIM FOR A PROPERTY WHICH IS MINE AND THAT HE HAS NO RIGHT TO GIVE I ACKNOWLEDGE HIS GENEROSITY
1334-135589-0048 BUT I DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HIS RIGHT OF POSSESSION NAY MUCH AS I ADMIRE AND I MAY SAY FOND AS I AM FOR TIME HAS NOT EFFACED THE FEELING OF HIS DAUGHTER IT STILL APPEARS TO ME THAT

1334-135589-0051 IS RECEIVING A FAVOR WERE IT GIVEN AS A MARRIAGE PORTION WITH HIS DAUGHTER NOW WHY SHOULD I ACCEPT AS A FAVOR WHAT I CAN CLAIM AS A RIGHT IT IS MY INTENTION OF APPEALING TO THE KING AND DEMANDING THE RESTORATION OF MY PROPERTY
1334-135589-0053 WHICH HAS BEEN SO LONG HELD BY OTHERS
1334-135589-0054 RECOLLECT ALSO THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR ASHLEY COOPER HAVE DONE THE KING MUCH MORE SERVICE THAN YOU EVER HAVE OR CAN DO THEY HAVE BEEN MOST IMPORTANT AGENTS IN HIS RESTORATION
1334-135589-0056 AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
1334-135589-0057 WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
1334-135589-0059 WHAT PROSPECT WAS THERE OF THE RESTORATION OF THE KING OR OF YOUR EVER BEING IN A POSITION TO APPLY FOR THE RESTORATION OF YOUR PROPERTY I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT HUMPHREY KNOWS MORE OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS THAN HE HAS MADE KNOWN TO US
1334-135589-0060 AND I THEREFORE SAY AGAIN MY DEAR EDWARD MAKE NO APPLICATION TILL YOU ASCERTAIN WHAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS MAY BE YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD MY DEAR ALICE AND I WILL BE GUIDED BY IT REPLIED EDWARD
1334-135589-0062 THOSE WHO HOLD THE PROPERTY THINK SO TOO AND SO FAR IT IS FORTUNATE NOW FROM WISER HEADS THAN MINE
1334-135589-0063 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE TO MEET THE PARTIES AND CLOSE WITH THEM AT ONCE BEFORE THE KING'S INTENTIONS ARE KNOWN THEY WOULD RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY AT A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE VALUE NOW IS THEIR TIME
1334-135589-0065 AND MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS ADVICE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED REPLIED EDWARD WE MUST GO NOW AND I WILL NOT FAIL TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THEM THIS VERY NIGHT WE MAY AS WELL HERE INFORM THE READER
1334-135589-0066 THAT THE ADVICE WAS IMMEDIATELY ACTED UPON AND THAT CHALONER AND GRENVILLE RECOVERED ALL THEIR ESTATES AT ABOUT FIVE YEARS PURCHASE EDWARD REMAINED AT COURT SEVERAL DAYS HE HAD WRITTEN TO HUMPHREY AND HAD DISPATCHED A MESSENGER WITH THE LETTER
1334-135589-0068 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
1334-135589-0069 AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
1334-135589-0071 EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
1334-135589-0072 BUT LITTLE ALTERED EXCEPT HAVING GROWN TALLER AND MORE ROUNDED AND PERFECT IN HER FIGURE AND HER COURT DRESS DISPLAYED PROPORTIONS WHICH HER HUMBLE COSTUME AT THE NEW FOREST HAD CONCEALED OR WHICH TIME HAD NOT MATURED
1334-135589-0074 AND THE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE WAS A SURPRISE TO HIM AND EDWARD IN HIS OWN MIND AGREED THAT SHE MIGHT WELL BE THE REIGNING TOAST OF THE DAY MISTER HEATHERSTONE ADVANCED AND MADE HIS OBEISANCE
1334-135589-0075 AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
1334-135589-0077 AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
1334-135589-0078 WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE ARMS OF HUMPHREY WHO HAD ARRIVED WITH THE MESSENGER AFTER THE GREETINGS WERE OVER EDWARD SAID ALICE AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENCE AND I FEAR I MUST SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
1334-135589-0080 LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
1334-135589-0081 THEY ARE WHOLLY UNSHACKLED FURTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE TO REPAY BY INSTALLMENTS THE MONEY EXPENDED IN THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE THIS I AM EMPOWERED TO STATE TO YOU AND I THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE
1334-135589-0083 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
1334-135589-0084 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SAY SO HUMPHREY HAVE WE NOT BEEN ATTACHED FROM OUR YOUTH YES IT WAS A YOUTHFUL PASSION I GRANT BUT RECOLLECT NOTHING CAME OF IT AND YEARS HAVE PASSED AWAY
1334-135589-0086 AND YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT A GIRL FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WILL CHERISH THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO TO SAY THE LEAST HAD TREATED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT IS MY VIEW OF THE MATTER EDWARD IT MAY BE WRONG
1334-135589-0087 AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
1334-135589-0089 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0090 REPLIED EDITH TO BE SURE YOU DO NOT MEET MANY IN THE NEW FOREST WHERE YOU HAVE LIVED ALL YOUR LIFE VERY TRUE MY DEAR SISTER PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON THAT THE NEW FOREST HAS HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME
1334-135589-0092 I WAS ABOUT TO CALL UPON HIM BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU FIRST I WILL GO WITH YOU I HAVE NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE REPLIED EDWARD AND YET I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HIM SAY NOTHING BUT MEET HIM CORDIALLY
1334-135589-0093 THAT WILL BE EXPLANATION SUFFICIENT I SHALL MEET HIM AS ONE WHOM I SHALL ALWAYS REVERE
1334-135589-0095 TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0096 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0098 PATIENCE COLORED UP AND TREMBLED WHEN EDWARD FIRST SAW HER EDWARD DID NOT REFER TO THE PAST FOR SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HE WOOED HER AGAIN AND WON HER
1334-135589-0099 THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE RESTORATION THERE WAS A FETE AT HAMPTON COURT GIVEN IN HONOR OF THREE MARRIAGES TAKING PLACE EDWARD BEVERLEY TO PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CHALONER
1334-135589-0101 SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONAGES WHO HAVE APPEARED IN OUR LITTLE HISTORY HUMPHREY MUST TAKE THE FIRST PLACE HIS LOVE OF FARMING CONTINUED EDWARD GAVE HIM A LARGE FARM RENT FREE
1334-135589-0102 AND IN A FEW YEARS HUMPHREY SAVED UP SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY FOR HIMSELF HE THEN MARRIED CLARA RATCLIFFE WHO HAS NOT APPEARED LATELY ON THE SCENE OWING TO HER HAVING BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE RESTORATION
1334-135589-0104 THE COTTAGE IN THE NEW FOREST WAS HELD BY AND EVENTUALLY MADE OVER TO PABLO WHO BECAME A VERY STEADY CHARACTER AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME MARRIED A YOUNG GIRL FROM ARNWOOD AND HAD A HOUSEFUL OF YOUNG GIPSIES
1334-135589-0105 OSWALD SO SOON AS EDWARD CAME DOWN TO ARNWOOD GAVE UP HIS PLACE IN THE NEW FOREST AND LIVED ENTIRELY WITH EDWARD AS HIS STEWARD AND PHOEBE ALSO WENT TO ARNWOOD AND LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE
1355-39947-0000 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THE LIFE INTERESTS OF WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
1355-39947-0001 IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION HOW FAR FROM THE HIGHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE SOCIAL MIND THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR SUPPRESSED ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS WHICH SUGGEST SUSPICION OF OR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO SUCH CURATIVE WORK
1355-39947-0003 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0006 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0009 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0012 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0015 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0016 NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DANGER ON A HIGHER LEVEL ARE OBJECTIONS WHICH COME FROM SERIOUS QUARTERS AND WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT SYMPATHY WITH TRUE SCIENCE IN RECENT TIMES THIS OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY FOUND ELOQUENT EXPRESSION IT IS AN OBJECTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MORALITY
1355-39947-0018 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0021 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0025 HE SEEMS TO THEM A MORAL WRONGDOER WHO NEGATES THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN FREEDOM A FORCIBLE BOOK OF RECENT DAYS CALLS THE SUGGESTIVE POWER OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME IT SAYS TO THE HYPNOTIST
1355-39947-0027 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0028 YOU THEREBY ROB HIM OF THOSE POWERS UPON WHICH HE MUST DEPEND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY BUT THIS CENSURE TOO IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN NOT BECAUSE IT URGES THE PURPOSIVE VIEWS AGAINST THE CAUSAL
1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0031 AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
1355-39947-0033 EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
1355-39947-0034 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0036 MORALITY POSTULATES THAT EVERYONE FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE CAN BE VICTORIOUS IF HE PUTS HIS STRONGEST EFFORTS TO THE TASK IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS I REPORTED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUGGESTIVE TREATMENT OF THE DRUG PASSION
1355-39947-0037 THE CASE OF A MORPHINIST TO MAKE CLEAR THIS PURPOSIVE SIDE OF THE CASE AS AGAINST THE CAUSAL ONE WHICH ALONE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN I MAY ADD A FEW FEATURES TO THE SHORT REPORT AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE
1355-39947-0039 IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0042 WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR IN THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY I WAS USING BETWEEN THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY EIGHT GRAINS OF MORPHINE DAILY HE PUT ME UNDER HIS TREATMENT OCTOBER SIXTH AND THAT DAY CUT ME DOWN BY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT TO NINE GRAINS A DAY OR
1355-39947-0043 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0046 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0048 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0049 HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0051 WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0054 AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0057 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0058 OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
1355-39947-0060 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0063 HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES
1355-39947-0064 ALL THAT INVOLVES THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS SUCH IS NOT PREPARED TO ENTER INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC MANAGED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067 AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
1355-39947-0069 WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0072 HAD TO BE THE BELIEF IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF MISSUS EDDY'S SCIENCE AND HEALTH FROM A CULTURAL VIEWPOINT TOO SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MUST STAND THE HIGHER THE MORE SHARPLY IT IS SEPARATED FROM SPECIAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0075 EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
1355-39947-0076 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0078 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0081 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0084 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REMODELING ACTIVITY IS GIVEN BUT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY GRAVE MISGIVINGS OUGHT TO BE FELT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK
1355-39947-0085 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0087 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0088 IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0090 AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
1355-39947-0091 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0093 WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0096 THE VARIETIES WHICH NATURE REALLY PRODUCES ARE BRAINS WHICH ARE MORE LIABLE THAN OTHERS TO PRODUCE ANTISOCIAL ACTIONS WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE START THAT THE ABNORMAL MIND NEVER INTRODUCES ANY NEW ELEMENTS BUT IS CHARACTERIZED ONLY BY A CHANGE OF PROPORTIONS
1355-39947-0097 THERE IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF A CERTAIN MENTAL PROCESS AND JUST FOR THAT REASON THERE MUST BE A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS TRANSITION FROM THE NORMAL TO THE ENTIRELY ABNORMAL
1363-135842-0001 ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0002 EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
1363-135842-0004 WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
1363-135842-0005 WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
1363-135842-0007 UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
1363-135842-0008 AM I A WHAT HE DEMANDED
1363-135842-0010 MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
1363-135842-0011 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0013 CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
1363-135842-0014 ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
1363-135842-0016 THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER OF THEIR OWN EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY BELONG TO THE ORDER OF MARSUPIALS WHICH MEANS POUCHED ANIMALS
1363-135842-0017 IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
1363-135842-0019 NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
1363-135842-0020 JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
1363-135842-0022 AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
1363-135842-0023 AND WERE BLACK FOR THE LOWER HALF THE REST BEING WHITE HE HAD A LONG WHITISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT ALTOGETHER WITH HIS SHARP FACE AND NAKED TAIL
1363-135842-0025 SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
1363-135842-0026 THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
1363-135842-0028 I'M GLAD YOU DID REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU SEE THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE POSSUM FAMILY MEANWHILE OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS CLIMBING A TREE
1363-135842-0029 AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
1363-135842-0031 THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0032 SUPPOSE YOU CLIMB A TREE UNC BILLY AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET THE EGGS FROM A NEST THAT YOU CANNOT REACH BY CRAWLING ALONG THE BRANCH ON WHICH IT IS PLACED SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0034 THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
1363-135842-0035 STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
1363-135842-0037 YOU ARE A BAD OLD RASCAL TO STEAL EGGS WHAT'S MORE
1363-135842-0038 IT IS A WONDER THAT BETWEEN YOU AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL ANY OF THE BIRDS SUCCEED IN RAISING FAMILIES AROUND HERE HAVE YOU VISITED FARMER BROWN'S HEN HOUSE LATELY UNC BILLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
1363-135842-0040 WHERE IS YOUR HOME ASKED JOHNNY CHUCK I KNOW SAID PETER RABBIT IT'S UP IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE UNC BILLY LOOKED DOWN AT PETER
1363-135842-0041 SAID HE ARE POSSUMS FOUND ANYWHERE EXCEPT AROUND HERE INQUIRED HAPPY JACK YES INDEED REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY ARE FOUND ALL DOWN THROUGH THE SUNNY SOUTH
1363-135842-0043 BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
1363-135842-0044 KNOW CRIED PETER I SAW HIM DO IT ONCE FARMER BROWN'S BOY SURPRISED UNC BILLY AND UNC BILLY JUST FELL RIGHT OVER DEAD POOH THAT'S A STORY PETER RABBIT
1363-135842-0046 AND HE DID TOO HE WAS THE DEADEST LOOKING THING I EVER SAW I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD MYSELF I WAS WATCHING FROM A BRAMBLE TANGLE WHERE I WAS HIDING AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT
1363-135842-0047 THE LIFE HAD BEEN SCARED RIGHT OUT OF UNC BILLY I GUESS FARMER BROWN'S BOY THOUGHT SO TOO HE PICKED UNC BILLY UP BY THE TAIL AND LOOKED HIM ALL OVER AND SAID YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1363-135842-0049 ON AN OLD STUMP WHILE HE WENT TO LOOK AT A NEST OF BLACKY THE CROW WHEN HE CAME BACK UNC BILLY WASN'T THERE I NEVER DID SEE UNC BILLY HURRY AS HE DID THE MINUTE FARMER BROWN'S BOY'S BACK WAS TURNED
1363-135842-0050 HE CAME TO LIFE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD DROPPED DEAD VERY GOOD PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE SOME OTHER SMART LITTLE PEOPLE TRY THAT TRICK SOMETIMES
1363-139304-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
1363-139304-0001 THE SELF WHO CAN TRACE ITS REINTEGRATION AS MORNING AFTER MORNING WE AWAKEN THE FLUX AND CONFLUENCE OF ITS COUNTLESS FACTORS INTERWEAVING REBUILDING THE DIM FIRST STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL
1363-139304-0003 SO IT WAS WITH GRAHAM AT THE END OF HIS VAST SLUMBER A DIM CLOUD OF SENSATION TAKING SHAPE A CLOUDY DREARINESS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF VAGUELY SOMEWHERE RECUMBENT FAINT BUT ALIVE
1363-139304-0004 THE PILGRIMAGE TOWARDS A PERSONAL BEING SEEMED TO TRAVERSE VAST GULFS TO OCCUPY EPOCHS GIGANTIC DREAMS THAT WERE TERRIBLE REALITIES AT THE TIME
1363-139304-0006 HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
1363-139304-0007 THE EFFORT OF A MAN NEAR DROWNING IN DARKNESS THEN CAME A PANORAMA OF DAZZLING UNSTABLE CONFLUENT SCENES GRAHAM BECAME AWARE THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN
1363-139304-0009 IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
1363-139304-0010 HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
1363-139304-0012 HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
1363-139304-0013 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
1363-139304-0015 THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
1363-139304-0016 BUT HIS MIND WAS QUITE CLEAR EVIDENTLY HIS SLEEP HAD BENEFITED HIM HE WAS NOT IN A BED AT ALL AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD BUT LYING NAKED ON A VERY SOFT AND YIELDING MATTRESS
1363-139304-0018 ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
1363-139304-0019 THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0021 THE SLIGHTLY GREENISH TINT OF THE GLASS LIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM ON EVERY HAND OBSCURED WHAT LAY BEHIND BUT HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A VAST APARTMENT OF SPLENDID APPEARANCE
1363-139304-0022 AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
1363-139304-0024 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
1363-139304-0025 AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
1363-139304-0027 IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
1363-139304-0028 WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
1363-139304-0030 TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
1363-139304-0031 AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0033 HIS MIND WAS STILL A SURGING PERPLEXITY CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT AND HAD BEEN REMOVED IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHERE AND WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE THE DISTANT CROWD BEYOND THE DEEP BLUE PILLARS
1363-139304-0034 BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
1363-139304-0036 AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
1363-139304-0037 HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
1363-139304-0039 AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
1363-139304-0040 WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
1363-139304-0042 THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
1363-139304-0043 THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
1363-139304-0045 BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE
1447-17506-0000 CHAPTER NINE COUNT FERRALTI

1447-17506-0006 THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0008 COUNT FERRALTI FOUND A PLACE BESIDE LOUISE BUT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE TO SAY TO HER DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE DANCES WERE UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BEING EXECUTED BY A TROUP OF LAUGHING PEASANTS DRESSED IN NATIVE COSTUME
1447-17506-0009 WHO SEEMED VERY PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ANXIOUS TO PLEASE THE THRONG OF TOURISTS PRESENT THE TARANTELLA ORIGINATED IN ISCHIA BUT SORRENTO AND CAPRI HAVE THE BEST DANCERS
1447-17506-0011 THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
1447-17506-0012 AND BETH REPLIED THAT HIS MANNERS WERE SO LIKE THOSE OF THEIR COUSIN LOUISE THAT THE TWO OUGHT TO GET ALONG NICELY TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN LIKED HIS NIECES TO MAKE FRIENDS AND ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN GENERALLY TO MEET THEM
1447-17506-0014 TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
1447-17506-0015 THAT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO TALK WITH THE MAN WHO SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY COURTEOUS TO HIS GUESTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN
1447-17506-0017 HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
1447-17506-0018 HE HAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS FERRALTI BUT ADDED NO TITLE A COUNT DID YOU SAY YES REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE PROPRIETOR LOOKED CURIOUSLY TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE BACK ONLY WAS VISIBLE

1455-134435-0000 THE GIRL WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD ON THAT NIGHT WHEN JESSE RAN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING TO GOD THAT HE BE GIVEN A SON HAD GROWN TO WOMANHOOD ON THE FARM
1455-134435-0002 BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
1455-134435-0003 SOMETIMES ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS SHE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE DISMISSING THE DRIVER SHE TOOK THE REINS IN HER OWN HANDS AND DROVE OFF AT TOP SPEED THROUGH THE STREETS
1455-134435-0005 SHE BECAME THOUGHTFUL AND MUTTERED WORDS SOMETIMES TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
1455-134435-0006 BUT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE RESPECT HE INSPIRED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
1455-134435-0008 AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS THOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF WINESBURG TO BE SOMETHING OF A DULLARD HIS EYES WERE BROWN AND AS A CHILD HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND PEOPLE A LONG TIME WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
1455-134435-0009 WHEN HE HEARD HIS MOTHER SPOKEN OF HARSHLY OR WHEN HE OVERHEARD HER BERATING HIS FATHER HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY TO HIDE SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT FIND A HIDING PLACE AND THAT CONFUSED HIM
1455-134435-0011 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DAVID HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GO INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER LIVED AND ON AN IMPULSE HE DECIDED TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME
1455-134435-0012 THE BOY'S IMAGINATION WAS EXCITED AND HE FANCIED THAT HE COULD SEE AND HEAR STRANGE THINGS IN THE DARKNESS INTO HIS MIND CAME THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS WALKING AND RUNNING IN SOME TERRIBLE VOID WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
1455-134435-0014 INTO ANOTHER ROAD AND GETTING UPON HIS KNEES FELT OF THE SOFT GROUND WITH HIS FINGERS BUT FOR THE FIGURE OF HIS GRANDFATHER WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NEVER FIND IN THE DARKNESS HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUST BE ALTOGETHER EMPTY
1455-134435-0015 WHEN HIS CRIES WERE HEARD BY A FARMER WHO WAS WALKING HOME FROM TOWN AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HE WAS SO TIRED AND EXCITED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM BY CHANCE DAVID'S FATHER KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
1455-134435-0017 THE REPORT THAT DAVID HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED RAN ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS OF WINESBURG WHEN HE CAME HOME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE BUT HIS MOTHER APPEARED AND CLUTCHED HIM EAGERLY IN HER ARMS DAVID THOUGHT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN
1455-134435-0018 FOR AN HOUR THE WOMAN SAT IN THE DARKNESS AND HELD HER BOY ALL THE TIME SHE KEPT TALKING IN A LOW VOICE DAVID COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD SO CHANGED HER HER HABITUALLY DISSATISFIED FACE HAD BECOME HE THOUGHT
1455-134435-0020 ON AND ON WENT HER VOICE IT WAS NOT
1455-134435-0021 BUT SHE MADE HIM HIDE AND BE SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD SENT THEM AWAY HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GAME HIS MOTHER AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN WERE PLAYING WITH HIM AND LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
1455-134435-0023 HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
1455-134435-0024 DURING THE LAST YEARS OF YOUNG DAVID'S BOYHOOD HE SAW HIS MOTHER BUT SELDOM AND SHE BECAME FOR HIM JUST A WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD ONCE LIVED STILL HE COULD NOT GET HER FIGURE OUT OF HIS MIND AND AS HE GREW OLDER IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE
1455-134435-0026 IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE NOT CORRUPTED BY MY PRESENCE SHE SAID SHARPLY
1455-134435-0027 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0029 AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
1455-134435-0030 ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOTED FOR HER FLAMING RED HAIR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WAS A BORN MOTHER AND BECAME THE BOY'S CARETAKER EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED SHE WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND SAT ON THE FLOOR
1455-134435-0032 AND HE DREAMED THAT HIS MOTHER HAD COME TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD CHANGED SO THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS AS SHE HAD BEEN THAT TIME AFTER HE RAN AWAY HE ALSO GREW BOLD AND REACHING OUT HIS HAND STROKED THE FACE OF THE WOMAN ON THE FLOOR SO THAT SHE WAS ECSTATICALLY HAPPY
1455-134435-0033 BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
1455-134435-0035 THERE WERE TWO INFLUENCES AT WORK IN JESSE BENTLEY AND ALL HIS LIFE HIS MIND HAD BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR THESE INFLUENCES FIRST THERE WAS THE OLD THING IN HIM HE WANTED TO BE A MAN OF GOD AND A LEADER AMONG MEN OF GOD
1455-134435-0036 HIS WALKING IN THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE FORESTS AT NIGHT HAD BROUGHT HIM CLOSE TO NATURE AND THERE WERE FORCES IN THE PASSIONATELY RELIGIOUS MAN THAT RAN OUT TO THE FORCES IN NATURE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD COME TO HIM WHEN A DAUGHTER
1455-134435-0038 HE HAD GROWN INTO MATURITY IN AMERICA IN THE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND HE LIKE ALL MEN OF HIS TIME HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE DEEP INFLUENCES THAT WERE AT WORK IN THE COUNTRY DURING THOSE YEARS WHEN MODERN INDUSTRIALISM WAS BEING BORN
1455-134435-0039 JESSE FORMED THE HABIT OF READING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HE INVENTED A MACHINE FOR THE MAKING OF FENCE OUT OF WIRE FAINTLY HE REALIZED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF OLD TIMES AND PLACES THAT HE HAD
1455-134435-0041 ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO MORAL STANDARDS WHEN THE WILL TO POWER WOULD REPLACE THE WILL TO SERVE AND BEAUTY WOULD BE WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN IN THE TERRIBLE HEADLONG RUSH OF MANKIND TOWARD THE ACQUIRING OF POSSESSIONS WAS TELLING ITS STORY TO JESSE THE MAN OF GOD
1455-134435-0042 AS IT WAS TO THE MEN ABOUT HIM THE GREEDY THING IN HIM WANTED TO MAKE MONEY FASTER THAN IT COULD BE MADE BY TILLING THE LAND MORE THAN ONCE HE WENT INTO WINESBURG TO TALK WITH HIS SON IN LAW JOHN HARDY ABOUT IT YOU ARE A BANKER AND YOU WILL HAVE CHANCES I NEVER HAD
1455-134435-0044 YOU GET INTO IT I WISH I WERE YOUNGER AND HAD YOUR CHANCE
1455-134435-0045 AT ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS AND HIS LEFT SIDE REMAINED SOMEWHAT WEAKENED AS HE TALKED HIS LEFT EYELID TWITCHED LATER
1455-134435-0047 AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD HAD AT LAST LOOKED WITH FAVOR UPON HIM AS FOR THE BOY ON THE FARM LIFE BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM IN A THOUSAND NEW AND DELIGHTFUL WAYS THE KINDLY ATTITUDE OF ALL ABOUT HIM EXPANDED HIS QUIET NATURE
1455-134435-0048 AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
1455-134435-0050 THE SOUNDS THAT CAME IN TO HIM THROUGH THE WINDOWS FILLED HIM WITH DELIGHT HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF THE LIFE IN THE HOUSE IN WINESBURG AND OF HIS MOTHER'S ANGRY VOICE THAT HAD ALWAYS MADE HIM TREMBLE THERE IN THE COUNTRY ALL SOUNDS WERE PLEASANT SOUNDS
1455-134435-0051 WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
1455-134435-0053 SIX SEVEN HE SAID SLOWLY WETTING HIS FINGER AND MAKING STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN MARKS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE DAVID RAN TO PUT ON HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT A FEVERISH DESIRE TO GET OUT OF DOORS TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0054 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0056 THEY RODE IN A COMFORTABLE OLD PHAETON DRAWN BY THE WHITE HORSE THE OLD MAN SCRATCHED HIS THIN WHITE BEARD AND TALKED TO HIMSELF OF HIS PLANS FOR INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE FIELDS THEY VISITED AND OF GOD'S PART IN THE PLANS ALL MEN MADE
1455-134435-0057 SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT DAVID AND SMILED HAPPILY AND THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE APPEARED TO FORGET THE BOY'S EXISTENCE
1455-134435-0059 JESSE AND HIS GRANDSON WERE DRIVING IN A DISTANT PART OF THE VALLEY SOME MILES FROM HOME A FOREST CAME DOWN TO THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE FOREST WINE CREEK WRIGGLED ITS WAY OVER STONES TOWARD A DISTANT RIVER
1455-134435-0060 ALL THE AFTERNOON JESSE HAD BEEN IN A MEDITATIVE MOOD AND NOW HE BEGAN TO TALK HIS MIND WENT BACK TO THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THOUGHTS OF A GIANT THAT MIGHT COME TO ROB AND PLUNDER HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
1455-134435-0062 WHEN A RABBIT JUMPED UP AND RAN AWAY THROUGH THE WOODS HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND DANCED WITH DELIGHT
1455-134435-0063 JESSE BENTLEY WENT ALONG UNDER THE TREES WITH HIS HEAD BOWED AND WITH HIS MIND IN A FERMENT HIS EARNESTNESS AFFECTED THE BOY WHO PRESENTLY BECAME SILENT AND A LITTLE ALARMED
1455-134435-0065 IT WAS IN JUST SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT OTHER DAVID TENDED THE SHEEP WHEN HIS FATHER CAME AND TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN UNTO SAUL HE MUTTERED
1455-134435-0066 HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
1455-134435-0068 WHEN JESSE BENTLEY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN IDEA SUDDENLY AROSE AND ADVANCED TOWARD HIM HIS TERROR GREW UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY SHOOK IN THE WOODS AN INTENSE SILENCE SEEMED TO LIE OVER EVERYTHING AND SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SILENCE CAME THE OLD MAN'S HARSH AND INSISTENT VOICE
1455-134435-0069 GRIPPING THE BOY'S SHOULDERS JESSE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE SKY AND SHOUTED THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED AND HIS HAND ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER TWITCHED ALSO MAKE A SIGN TO ME GOD HE CRIED HERE I STAND WITH THE BOY DAVID
1455-134435-0071 THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0072 ON AND ON HE RAN DOWN THE HILLSIDE SOBBING AS HE RAN WHEN HE FELL OVER THE ROOTS OF A TREE AND IN FALLING STRUCK HIS HEAD
1455-138263-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0003 AND SEEMED TO COVER PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE EAST THE NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ONE OF THESE JETS EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCLE OF NEANDER SITUATED ON THE FORTIETH MERIDIAN
1455-138263-0004 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0006 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0010 WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
1455-138263-0012 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0013 THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0018 HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
1455-138263-0019 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0021 HER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS THE MOON DOES NOT SEEM HABITABLE TO ME NOR DOES SHE SEEM PROPITIOUS TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT NOR SUFFICIENT FOR THE WANTS OF EXISTENCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
1455-138263-0022 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0024 AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS THE GEOLOGICAL WORKS OF NATURE NEVER THE WORK OF MAN IF THEN THERE EXIST REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ON THE MOON
1455-138263-0025 THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
1455-138263-0027 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0028 SAID NICHOLL LET US ATTACK THE SECOND QUESTION AN INDISPENSABLE COMPLEMENT OF THE FIRST I ASK THE HONORABLE COMMISSION IF THE MOON IS NOT HABITABLE HAS SHE EVER BEEN INHABITED CITIZEN BARBICANE
1455-138263-0030 I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
1455-138263-0031 BUT I ADD THAT THESE RACES HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND ARE NOW FOREVER EXTINCT
1455-138263-0033 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0034 CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0037 VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
1455-138263-0039 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0040 ASKED NICHOLL QUICKLY BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY THEN THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE MOON UPON HER AXIS WAS NOT EQUAL TO HER REVOLUTION AN EQUALITY WHICH PRESENTS EACH PART OF HER DISC DURING FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE ACTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS
1455-138263-0042 AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0045 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0046 BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0048 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0051 AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
1455-138263-0052 BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
1455-138263-0054 BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
1455-138263-0055 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1502-122615-0000 POPE'S ILIAD A SINGLE MOMENT SERVED TO CONVINCE THE YOUTH THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN A HAND WAS LAID WITH A POWERFUL PRESSURE ON HIS ARM AND THE LOW VOICE OF UNCAS MUTTERED IN HIS EAR THE HURONS ARE DOGS
1502-122615-0001 THE SIGHT OF A COWARD'S BLOOD CAN NEVER MAKE A WARRIOR TREMBLE THE GRAY HEAD AND THE SAGAMORE ARE SAFE
1502-122615-0003 BUT A GENTLE PUSH FROM HIS FRIEND URGED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR AND ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER THAT MIGHT ATTEND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY YIELDING TO THE NECESSITY HE QUITTED THE PLACE AND MINGLED WITH THE THRONG THAT HOVERED NIGH
1502-122615-0004 THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
1502-122615-0006 HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE COUNCIL LODGE RESOLVED TO SEEK AND QUESTION DAVID IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS DOUBTS ON REACHING THE BUILDING WHICH HAD PROVED ALIKE THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT AND THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
1502-122615-0007 THOUGH THE RETURN OF DUNCAN WAS LIKELY TO REMIND THEM OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT IT PRODUCED NO VISIBLE SENSATION SO FAR THE TERRIBLE SCENE THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED
1502-122615-0009 HE WALKED INTO THE LODGE AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITH A GRAVITY THAT ACCORDED ADMIRABLY WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF HIS HOSTS A HASTY BUT SEARCHING GLANCE SUFFICED TO TELL HIM THAT THOUGH UNCAS STILL REMAINED WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
1502-122615-0010 DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
1502-122615-0012 HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
1502-122615-0013 HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
1502-122615-0015 IN THE CASES OF SUCH SUPPOSED VISITATIONS HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED TO FURTHER HIS OWN ENDS IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT JUST THEN TO HAVE UTTERED A PROPOSAL
1502-122615-0016 THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE SATISFACTION AWARE OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE DIGNITY OF HIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER HOWEVER HE REPRESSED HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH SUITABLE MYSTERY SPIRITS DIFFER
1502-122615-0018 EQUAL TO THAT MAINTAINED BY THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN TRUTH A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE AFFLICTED WOMAN THE MINUTES LINGERED AND THE DELAY HAD SEEMED AN HOUR TO THE ADVENTURER IN EMPIRICISM WHEN THE HURON LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE
1502-122615-0019 AND DREW HIS ROBE ACROSS HIS BREAST AS IF ABOUT TO LEAD THE WAY TO THE LODGE OF THE INVALID JUST THEN A WARRIOR OF POWERFUL FRAME DARKENED THE DOOR AND STALKING SILENTLY AMONG THE ATTENTIVE GROUP
1502-122615-0021 SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN
1502-122615-0022 DREW HIS TOMAHAWK FROM HIS GIRDLE AND FILLING THE BOWL ON ITS HEAD BEGAN TO INHALE THE VAPORS OF THE WEED THROUGH THE HOLLOW HANDLE
1502-122615-0024 HAS MY FRIEND FOUND THE MOOSE THE YOUNG MEN STAGGER UNDER THEIR BURDENS RETURNED MAGUA LET REED THAT BENDS GO ON THE HUNTING PATH HE WILL MEET THEM A DEEP AND AWFUL SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE UTTERANCE OF THE FORBIDDEN NAME
1502-122615-0025 AS THOUGH ALL HAD INHALED AN IMPURITY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMOKE WREATHED ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN LITTLE EDDIES
1502-122615-0027 THE LOOKS OF MOST OF THE WARRIORS WERE RIVETED ON THE EARTH
1502-122615-0028 SUFFERED THEIR WILD AND GLARING EYEBALLS TO ROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF A WHITE HEADED SAVAGE
1502-122615-0030 THEN HE AROSE AND LIFTED HIS VOICE IN THE GENERAL SILENCE IT WAS A LIE HE SAID I HAD NO SON HE WHO WAS CALLED BY THAT NAME IS FORGOTTEN
1502-122615-0031 THE WICKED CHIPPEWAS CHEATED MY SQUAW
1502-122615-0033 THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE CONTRADICTED HIS FIGURATIVE AND BOASTFUL LANGUAGE
1502-122615-0034 STANDING A SINGLE MINUTE TO ENJOY HIS BITTER TRIUMPH HE TURNED AWAY AS IF SICKENING AT THE GAZE OF MEN AND VEILING HIS FACE IN HIS BLANKET HE WALKED FROM THE LODGE WITH THE NOISELESS STEP OF AN INDIAN SEEKING
1502-122615-0036 SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
1502-122615-0037 BUT WHO HAS EVER FOUND A HURON ASLEEP THE DARKNESS OF THE IMPENDING CLOUD WHICH PRECEDES A BURST OF THUNDER WAS NOT BLACKER THAN THE BROW OF MAGUA AS HE EXCLAIMED THE DELAWARES OF THE LAKES
1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0003 IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0006 ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
1502-122619-0007 THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
1502-122619-0009 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0010 WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0016 HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
1502-122619-0018 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0022 AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
1502-122619-0024 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0025 WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
1502-122619-0027 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0030 IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
1502-122619-0031 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0034 LET MY CANADA FATHER COME RETURNED THE OTHER EVASIVELY HIS CHILDREN ARE READY TO SEE HIM WHEN THE GREAT CHIEF COMES IT IS TO SMOKE WITH THE INDIANS IN THEIR WIGWAMS THE HURONS SAY TOO HE IS WELCOME
1502-122619-0036 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0039 COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
1502-122619-0040 SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0045 THEN THEY FLED TO THE DELAWARES FOR SAY THEY THE DELAWARES ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR MINDS ARE TURNED FROM THEIR CANADA FATHER THIS INSINUATION WAS A HOME THRUST
1502-122619-0046 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0048 THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0051 HE WILL SEE NO CHANGE IT IS TRUE MY YOUNG MEN DID NOT GO OUT ON THE WAR PATH THEY HAD DREAMS FOR NOT DOING SO BUT THEY LOVE AND VENERATE THE GREAT WHITE CHIEF
1502-122619-0052 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0054 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0055 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
1502-122619-0057 THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
1502-122619-0058 THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
1502-122619-0060 THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
1502-122619-0061 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0063 ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
1502-122619-0064 HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
1502-122619-0066 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0067 IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
1502-122619-0069 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0072 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE AGED WARRIOR WHOSE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO SPEAK WAS SILENT SEEMINGLY OPPRESSED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS SUBJECT THE DELAY HAD ALREADY CONTINUED LONG BEYOND THE USUAL DELIBERATIVE PAUSE
1502-122619-0073 THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
1502-122619-0075 HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
1502-122619-0076 THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
1502-122619-0078 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0081 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0087 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0090 WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
1502-122619-0091 WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
1502-122619-0093 SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
1502-122619-0094 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1502-122619-0096 ESCORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CAUSED ALL THESE SOLEMN PREPARATIONS TOWARD THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE CROWD OPENED IN A LANE AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD RE ENTERED
1553-140047-0000 SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
1553-140047-0002 THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1553-140047-0003 AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
1553-140047-0005 WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
1553-140047-0006 AND SETTLED UPON THE SELLING OF SOAP FOR A PREMIUM THEY HAD SOLD ENOUGH TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DURING THE EARLIER AUTUMN TO SECURE A CHILD'S HANDCART WHICH THOUGH VERY WEAK ON ITS PINS COULD BE TRUNDLED OVER THE COUNTRY ROADS
1553-140047-0008 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0009 WITH HIGHLY COLORED PICTURES OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE AWARDED FOR THE SALE OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAKES IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLARA BELLE AND SUSAN SIMPSON CONSULTED REBECCA WHO THREW HERSELF SOLIDLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE ENTERPRISE
1553-140047-0011 AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
1553-140047-0012 NOT COUNTING MISTER SIMPSON WHO ORDINARILY SAT ELSEWHERE AT THE TOWN'S EXPENSE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES RAPTUROUSLY IN THE VISION OF THE BANQUET LAMP WHICH SPEEDILY BECAME TO THEM MORE DESIRABLE THAN FOOD DRINK OR CLOTHING
1553-140047-0014 AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
1553-140047-0015 BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0017 FROM WHICH THE JOY DAZZLED AGENT MIGHT TAKE HIS CHOICE SEESAW SIMPSON WAS NOT IN THE SYNDICATE CLARA BELLE WAS RATHER A SUCCESSFUL AGENT BUT SUSAN WHO COULD ONLY SAY THOAP NEVER MADE LARGE RETURNS
1553-140047-0018 AND THE TWINS WHO WERE SOMEWHAT YOUNG TO BE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY COULD BE GIVEN ONLY A HALF DOZEN CAKES AT A TIME AND WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR BUSINESS TRIPS A BRIEF DOCUMENT STATING THE PRICE PER CAKE DOZEN AND BOX
1553-140047-0020 AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
1553-140047-0021 AND THEY HAD WHAT WAS STILL BETTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF A CERTAIN PATENT MEDICINE VENDER'S DISCOURSE AT THE MILLTOWN FAIR HIS METHOD WHEN ONCE OBSERVED COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR HIS MANNER NOR HIS VOCABULARY
1553-140047-0023 SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
1553-140047-0024 OH REBECCA DON'T LET'S SAY THAT INTERPOSED EMMA JANE HYSTERICALLY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FOOL IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL EMMA JANE REBUKED REBECCA THAT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE ONE
1553-140047-0026 IMMERSE THE GARMENTS IN A TUB LIGHTLY RUBBING THE MORE SOILED PORTIONS WITH THE SOAP LEAVE THEM SUBMERGED IN WATER FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE AND THEN THE YOUNGEST BABY CAN WASH THEM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
1553-140047-0027 BABE NOT BABY CORRECTED REBECCA FROM THE CIRCULAR IT'S JUST THE SAME THING ARGUED EMMA JANE OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE SAME THING BUT A BABY HAS GOT TO BE CALLED BABE OR INFANT IN A CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0029 AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
1553-140047-0030 OH WON'T IT BE THE GREATEST FUN EMMA JANE AT SOME OF THE HOUSES WHERE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ME I SHAN'T BE FRIGHTENED AND I SHALL REEL OFF THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE INVALID BABE AND ALL
1553-140047-0032 THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
1553-140047-0033 SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
1553-140047-0035 SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
1553-140047-0036 BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
1553-140047-0038 IT WAS A RUSTLY DAY A SCARLET AND BUFF YELLOW AND CARMINE BRONZE AND CRIMSON DAY THERE WERE STILL MANY LEAVES ON THE OAKS AND MAPLES MAKING A GOODLY SHOW OF RED AND BROWN AND GOLD
1553-140047-0039 THE AIR WAS LIKE SPARKLING CIDER AND EVERY FIELD HAD ITS HEAPS OF YELLOW AND RUSSET GOOD THINGS TO EAT ALL READY FOR THE BARNS THE MILLS AND THE MARKETS THE HORSE FORGOT HIS TWENTY YEARS
1553-140047-0041 GREAT WIDE BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WORLD WITH THE WONDERFUL WATER ROUND YOU CURLED AND THE WONDERFUL GRASS UPON YOUR BREAST WORLD YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DREST
1553-140047-0042 DULL EMMA JANE HAD NEVER SEEMED TO REBECCA SO NEAR SO DEAR SO TRIED AND TRUE AND REBECCA TO EMMA JANE'S FAITHFUL HEART HAD NEVER BEEN SO BRILLIANT SO BEWILDERING SO FASCINATING AS IN THIS VISIT TOGETHER
1553-140047-0044 NO IT DON'T NOT A MITE PERHAPS DIZZY ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT'S NEAREST I'D LIKE TO EAT COLOR AND DRINK IT AND SLEEP IN IT IF YOU COULD BE A TREE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
1553-140047-0045 EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
1553-140047-0047 I'D CHOOSE TO BE THAT SCARLET MAPLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE POND THERE AND SHE POINTED WITH THE WHIP THEN I COULD SEE SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR PINK APPLE TREE BY THE PIG PEN I COULD LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
1553-140047-0048 SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF

1553-140048-0002 THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
1553-140048-0004 THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE

1553-140048-0014 AND THE PRICES OF BOTH THAT AND THE SNOW WHITE WERE UNFOLDED PRESENTLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER SILENT PARTNER AT THE GATE AND WAS TALKING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THIS GRAND PERSONAGE ALL HER LIFE
1553-140048-0016 I DON'T THINK ANYTHING TAKES THE PLACE OF THE FARM WHERE ONE LIVED WHEN ONE WAS A CHILD OBSERVED REBECCA NEARLY BURSTING WITH PRIDE AT HAVING AT LAST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN IN GENERAL CONVERSATION

1553-140048-0049 ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS

1578-6379-0008 MISS JELLINGS WAS INSISTENT THAT RECREATION SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PURSUED OUT OF DOORS THE TWO COULD EASILY HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GREET PATTY'S RETURN INSIDE BUT IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE TRIO NEVER TO ASK PERMISSION IN MINOR MATTERS IT WASTED ONE'S CREDIT UNNECESSARILY

1578-6379-0047 PUNCTUATED BY AN OCCASIONAL DEEP BASS LAUGH WHEN THEY HEARD THE FRONT DOOR CLOSE WITH ONE ACCORD THEY INVADED HARRIET GLADDEN'S ROOM WHICH COMMANDED THE WALK AND PRESSED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE PANE A SHORT THICK SET MAN OF GERMAN BUILD WAS WADDLING TOWARD THE GATE AND THE TROLLEY CAR
1578-6379-0048 THEY GAZED WITH WIDE HORRIFIED EYES AND TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO MEET PATTY AS SHE TRUDGED UPSTAIRS LUGGING HER ERRANT SUIT CASE A GLANCE TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND DROPPING ON THE TOP STEP SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING AND LAUGHED
1578-140045-0001 IN THE MATTER OF MERE PICTORIAL BEAUTY SO SOON DOES THE SOUL OUTGROW ITS MANSIONS THAT AFTER ONCE SEEING MILLTOWN HER FANCY RAN OUT TO THE FUTURE SIGHT OF PORTLAND FOR THAT HAVING ISLANDS AND A HARBOR AND TWO PUBLIC MONUMENTS
1578-140045-0002 MUST BE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MILLTOWN WHICH WOULD SHE FELT TAKE ITS PROUD PLACE AMONG THE CITIES OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ITS TREMENDOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BY ANY IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION
1578-140045-0004 LAND NO MOTHER THERE AIN'T NO HOME'PATH BOUT MISS PARKS SHE DRIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I CAN'T SEE REBECCA AS A LADY DOCTOR SOMEHOW MUSED MISSUS COBB HER GIFT O GAB IS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THE MAKIN OF HER

1578-140045-0007 SOLITUDE BUT WITH NONE OF THEM DID REBECCA SEEM TO GRAPPLE SATISFACTORILY WRITE AS YOU TALK REBECCA INSISTED POOR MISS DEARBORN WHO SECRETLY KNEW THAT SHE COULD NEVER MANAGE A GOOD COMPOSITION HERSELF
1578-140045-0008 NOW IN YOUR LAST ONE ON SOLITUDE YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING AND YOU'VE MADE IT TOO COMMON AND EVERY DAY TO SOUND WELL THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUS AND YOURS IN IT YOU OUGHT TO SAY ONE NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE LIKE GOOD WRITING ONE OPENS A FAVORITE BOOK
1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140045-0011 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS SHE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YOU HAVE AT LEAST TWO LINES REBECCA INSISTED THE TEACHER FOR I SEE THEM ON YOUR SLATE
1578-140045-0013 AND THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG IDEA SELDOM APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MUST STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND TRY AGAIN REBECCA SHE SAID BUT SHE SAID IT SMILINGLY YOUR POETRY HASN'T A VERY NICE IDEA IN IT FOR A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO LOVE DUTY

1578-140045-0016 IT THEN APPEARED IN THE FOLLOWING FORM WHICH HARDLY SATISFIED EITHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SOLITUDE IT WOULD BE FALSE TO SAY THAT ONE COULD EVER BE ALONE WHEN ONE HAS ONE'S LOVELY THOUGHTS TO COMFORT ONE
1578-140045-0017 ONE SITS BY ONE'S SELF IT IS TRUE BUT ONE THINKS ONE OPENS ONE'S FAVORITE BOOK AND READS ONE'S FAVORITE STORY ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S AUNT OR ONE'S BROTHER FONDLES ONE'S CAT

1578-140045-0022 DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
1578-140045-0023 EMMA JANE LIVING AND I WERE WALKING ALONG AND I WAS AHEAD I SAW THE WATER STREAMING OVER THE ROAD TOWARDS THE DITCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN AT MILLTOWN WHEN ELIZA TOOK HER BABY AND RAN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE ICE BLOCKS PURSUED BY THE BLOODHOUNDS
1578-140045-0025 AND PART OF THE TIME SHE HAD TO PURSUE THE DOG I KNEW LIVING WOULD REMEMBER TOO SO I TOOK OFF MY WATERPROOF AND WRAPPED IT ROUND MY BOOKS FOR A BABY
1578-140045-0026 JUST LIKE THAT THE SAME AS ELIZA DID IN THE PLAY THEN I LEAPED FROM PUDDLE TO PUDDLE AND LIVING AND EMMA JANE PURSUED ME LIKE THE BLOODHOUNDS IT'S JUST LIKE THAT STUPID MINNIE SMELLIE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A GAME WHEN SHE SEES ONE AND ELIZA WASN'T SWEARING WHEN SHE SAID MY GOD THE RIVER
1578-140045-0028 AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
1578-140045-0029 BUT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I CAN'T HARDLY TELL TILL SHE GROWS UP SHE'S GOT THE MAKING OF MOST ANYTHING IN HER REBECCA HAS BUT I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF WE WERE NOT FITTED TO COPE WITH HER STUFF AN NONSENSE SAID MIRANDA
1578-140049-0001 HAD COME TO PASS THE HOLIDAY WITH THE SAWYERS EVERY YEAR REBECCA SAT SILENT WITH A BOOK AFTER THE DINNER DISHES WERE WASHED AND WHEN IT WAS NEARLY FIVE ASKED IF SHE MIGHT GO TO THE SIMPSONS

1578-140049-0005 THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
1578-140049-0007 ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE SAID MISS ELLEN BURNHAM

1578-140049-0014 AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
1578-140049-0016 AND SAW A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING IN HER DIRECTION IN A MOMENT SHE AND EMMA JANE MET AND EXCHANGED A BREATHLESS EMBRACE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED PANTED EMMA JANE DON'T TELL ME IT'S BROKEN EXCLAIMED REBECCA NO OH NO NOT THAT

1578-140049-0019 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE EXPENSE OF KEEPING UP THE LAMP REBECCA NO WE DIDN'T BUT LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT TILL AFTER THE PARTY I HAVE A HANDFUL OF NUTS AND RAISINS AND SOME APPLES I HAVE PEPPERMINTS AND MAPLE SUGAR SAID EMMA JANE THEY HAD A REAL THANKSGIVING DINNER
1578-140049-0020 THE DOCTOR GAVE THEM SWEET POTATOES AND CRANBERRIES AND TURNIPS FATHER SENT A SPARE RIB AND MISSUS COBB A CHICKEN AND A JAR OF MINCE MEAT AT HALF PAST FIVE ONE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED IN AT THE SIMPSONS WINDOWS AND SEEN THE PARTY AT ITS HEIGHT
1578-140049-0022 ON IT STOOD THE SACRED THE ADORED THE LONG DESIRED OBJECT ALMOST AS BEAUTIFUL AND NEARLY HALF AS LARGE AS THE ADVERTISEMENT THE BRASS GLISTENED LIKE GOLD AND THE CRIMSON PAPER SHADE GLOWED LIKE A GIANT RUBY
1578-140049-0023 IN THE WIDE SPLASH OF LIGHT THAT IT FLUNG UPON THE FLOOR SAT THE SIMPSONS IN REVERENT AND SOLEMN SILENCE EMMA JANE STANDING BEHIND THEM HAND IN HAND WITH REBECCA THERE SEEMED TO BE NO DESIRE FOR CONVERSATION THE OCCASION WAS TOO THRILLING AND SERIOUS FOR THAT
1578-140049-0025 MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE
1578-140049-0026 AND OH I'M SO GLAD YOU BOTH LIVE WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT SHINE FROM OUR WINDOWS I WONDER HOW LONG IT WILL BURN WITHOUT BEIN FILLED IF I ONLY KEEP IT LIT ONE HOUR EVERY NIGHT
1578-140049-0028 IT WAS MISTER ALADDIN WHISPERED REBECCA AS THEY RAN DOWN THE PATH TO THE GATE SEESAW FOLLOWED THEM AND HANDSOMELY OFFERED TO SEE THEM APIECE DOWN THE ROAD BUT REBECCA DECLINED HIS ESCORT WITH SUCH DECISION THAT HE DID NOT PRESS THE MATTER
1578-140049-0029 BUT WENT TO BED TO DREAM OF HER INSTEAD IN HIS DREAMS FLASHES OF LIGHTNING PROCEEDED FROM BOTH HER EYES AND SHE HELD A FLAMING SWORD IN EITHER HAND REBECCA ENTERED THE HOME DINING ROOM JOYOUSLY THE BURNHAM SISTERS HAD GONE AND THE TWO AUNTS WERE KNITTING
1578-140049-0031 AND OH AUNT JANE AUNT MIRANDA IF YOU'LL ONLY COME INTO THE KITCHEN AND LOOK OUT OF THE SINK WINDOW YOU CAN SEE THE BANQUET LAMP SHINING ALL RED JUST AS IF THE SIMPSONS HOUSE WAS ON FIRE AND PROBABLY IT WILL BE BEFORE LONG OBSERVED MIRANDA I'VE GOT NO PATIENCE WITH SUCH FOOLISH GOIN'S ON
1578-140049-0032 JANE ACCOMPANIED REBECCA INTO THE KITCHEN ALTHOUGH THE FEEBLE GLIMMER WHICH SHE WAS ABLE TO SEE FROM THAT DISTANCE DID NOT SEEM TO HER A DAZZLING EXHIBITION SHE TRIED TO BE AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS POSSIBLE REBECCA WHO WAS IT
1578-140049-0034 I ASKED YOU WHO SOLD THE SOAP TO ADAM LADD RESUMED MISS JANE ADAM LADD THEN HE'S A LADD TOO WHAT FUN ANSWER ME REBECCA OH EXCUSE ME AUNT JANE I WAS SO BUSY THINKING EMMA JANE AND I SOLD THE SOAP TO MISTER LADD
1578-140049-0035 HE NEEDED THE SOAP DREADFULLY AS A PRESENT FOR HIS AUNT MISS JANE STILL LOOKED A LITTLE UNCONVINCED THOUGH SHE ONLY SAID I HOPE YOUR AUNT MIRANDA WON'T MIND BUT YOU KNOW HOW PARTICULAR SHE IS REBECCA AND I REALLY WISH YOU WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY WITHOUT ASKING HER FIRST FOR YOUR ACTIONS ARE VERY QUEER
1578-140049-0037 REBECCA'S HAIR WAS LOOSENED AND FALLING OVER HER FOREHEAD IN RUFFLED WAVES HER EYES WERE BRILLIANT HER CHEEKS CRIMSON THERE WAS A HINT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GIRL'S FACE OF SENSITIVENESS AND DELICACY AS WELL AS OF ARDOR
1578-140049-0038 THERE WAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG OAK BUT ONE COULD EASILY DIVINE THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE SOULS BY NATURE PITCHED TOO HIGH BY SUFFERING PLUNGED TOO LOW
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME
1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS
1594-135914-0020 I THINK YOU CHARGE ME WITH VIOLENCE AND INJUSTICE WHO IS HE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING THE REGARD AND RESPELL HE HAD FOR ME IS IN A MISERABLE CONDITION SPEAK FREELY
1594-135914-0022 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE IF I HAVE LET FALL ANY WORD THAT IS NOT AGREEABLE TO YOUR MAJESTY I MOST HUMBLY BESEECH YOU TO FORGIVE ME BUT HE WHOSE INNOCENCE AND WRETCHED STATE YOU DESIRE TO BE INFORMED OF
1594-135914-0023 IS GANEM THE UNHAPPY SON OF ABOU AYOUB LATE A RICH MERCHANT OF DAMASCUS HE SAVED MY LIFE FROM A GRAVE AND AFFORDED ME A SANCTUARY IN HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT
1594-135914-0026 I OWE THIS JUSTICE TO HIS VIRTUE TO DECLARE HIS BEHAVIOUR WAS ALWAYS SUITABLE TO HIS WORDS YOU COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WELL KNOW WITH WHAT RIGOUR YOU HAVE TREATED HIM AND YOU WILL ANSWER FOR IT BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF GOD
1594-135914-0028 LET ME INFORM YOU THAT GANEM'S RESPECTFUL BEHAVIOUR JOINED TO ALL THE GOOD OFFICES HE DID ME GAINED HIM MY ESTEEM I WENT FURTHER YET YOU KNOW THE TYRANNY OF LOVE I FELT SOME TENDER INCLINATION RISING IN MY BREAST
1594-135914-0029 HE PERCEIVED IT BUT FAR FROM AVAILING HIMSELF OF MY FRAILTY AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FLAME WHICH CONSUMED HIM HE STILL REMAINED STEADY IN HIS DUTY AND ALL THAT HIS PASSION COULD FORCE FROM HIM WERE THE WORDS I HAVE ALREADY REPEATED TO YOUR MAJESTY
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION
1594-135914-0032 WHEN SHE HAD DONE SPEAKING
1594-135914-0034 GANEM WENT ABROAD SO VERY SELDOM THAT YOU NEED NOT WONDER WE WERE NOT THE FIRST THAT HEARD OF YOUR RETURN BESIDES GANEM WHO TOOK UPON HIM TO DELIVER THE LETTER I WROTE TO NOURON NIHAR
1594-135914-0035 WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE HE COULD FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF PUTTING IT INTO HER OWN HANDS IT IS ENOUGH FETNAH
1594-135914-0037 AND RISING AGAIN SAID COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS AFTER RETURNING YOUR MAJESTY THANKS FOR GANEM I MOST HUMBLY ENTREAT YOU TO CAUSE IT TO BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT YOUR DO MINIONS THAT YOU PARDON THE SON OF ABOU AYOUB AND THAT HE MAY SAFELY COME TO YOU
1594-135914-0038 I MUST DO MORE REJOINED THE PRINCE IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING SAVED YOUR LIFE AND THE RESPECT HE HAS STREWN FOR ME TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE LOSS OF HIS FORTUNE IN SHORT TO REPAIR THE WRONG I HAVE DONE TO HIMSELF AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0040 SHE THEN WITHDREW INTO THE APARTMENT SHE HAD OCCUPIED BEFORE HER MELANCHOLY ADVENTURE
1594-135914-0041 SHE SPEND THE WHOLE DAY AND THE THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD IN GIVING ALMS AT THE MOSQUES AND RETURNED TO THE PALACE IN THE EVENING
1594-135914-0043 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MOST CHARITABLE MAN AND SPENT ABOVE TWO THIRDS OF HIS INCOME IN RELIEVING POOR STRANGERS SICK OR IN DISTRESS DID NOT MAKE FETNAH WAIT KNOWING BY HER DRESS THAT SHE WAS A LADY BELONGING TO THE PALACE I APPLY MYSELF TO YOU SAID SHE
1594-135914-0044 PUTTING THE PURSE INTO HIS HANDS AS A PERSON WHOSE PIETY IS CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY I DESIRE YOU TO DISTRIBUTE THAT GOLD AMONG THE POOR STRANGERS YOU RELIEVE FOR I KNOW YOU MAKE IT YOUR BUSINESS TO ASSIST THOSE WHO APPLY TO YOUR CHARITY
1594-135914-0046 AND WILL BE PLEASED TO STEP TO MY HOUSE
1594-135914-0047 I MET THEM YESTERDAY AS THEY WERE COMING INTO THE CITY THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND IT MOVED ME THE MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE PERSONS OF RANK THROUGH ALL THE RAGS THAT COVERED THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPRESSION THE SUN HAS MADE ON THEIR FACES
1594-135914-0049 BECAUSE WE WISH TO LET THEM TAKE SOME REST BEFORE WE TROUBLE THEM WITH OUR QUESTIONS FETNAH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FELT A CURIOSITY TO SEE THEM THE SYNDIC WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0050 FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
1594-135914-0052 FETNAH RAISED HER UP AND SAID MY GOOD LADY
1594-135914-0053 MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE THEY LIE IN THOSE BEDS YOU SEE BY EACH OTHER
1594-135914-0055 THAT FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC'S WIFE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS
1594-135914-0056 SAID TO GANEM'S MOTHER BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US YOUR MISFORTUNES AND RECOUNT YOUR STORY YOU CANNOT MAKE THE RELATION TO ANY PERSONS BETTER DISPOSED TO USE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO COMFORT YOU
1594-135914-0058 BUT SUPPRESSING HER AGITATION AND CONCERN SHE SUFFERED GANEM'S MOTHER TO PROCEED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
1594-135914-0059 I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
1594-135914-0061 WHAT A PLEASURE WOULD IT BE FOR HIS SISTER AND ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN EMBRACING HIM WE SHOULD FORGET THE LOSS OF OUR PROPERTY AND ALL THE EVILS WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT ALAS
1594-135914-0062 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID FETNAH INTERRUPTING HER THERE HE IS NO MORE GUILTY THAN YOU ARE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE FOR I AM THAT VERY FETNAH YOU SO MUCH COMPLAIN OF WHO THROUGH SOME FATALITY IN MY STARS
1594-135914-0064 AND DOUBT NOT HE WILL DO YOU AS MUCH GOOD AS HE HAS DONE YOU INJURY YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS ENEMIES HE WAITS FOR GANEM TO REQUITE THE SERVICE HE HAS DONE ME BY UNITING OUR FORTUNES HE GIVES ME TO HIM FOR HIS CONSORT
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0067 THE WEALTH GANEM HAD IN THIS CITY IS NOT LOST IT IS IN MY APARTMENT IN THE PALACE BUT I KNOW ALL THE TREASURE OF THE WORLD CANNOT COMFORT YOU WITHOUT GANEM IF I MAY JUDGE OF YOU BY MYSELF BLOOD IS NO LESS POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN GREAT MINDS
1594-135914-0068 BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
1594-135914-0070 HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS ON A CAMEL BECAUSE HE HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SIT THEY HAD ALREADY UNBOUND HIM AND WERE CARRYING HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHEN I HAPPENED TO PASS BY I WENT UP TO THE YOUNG MAN VIEWED HIM ATTENTIVELY
1594-135914-0071 AND FANCIED HIS COUNTENANCE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN TO ME I ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY BUT ALL THE ANSWERS I COULD GET WERE SIGHS AND TEARS I TOOK PITY ON HIM
1594-135914-0073 I HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE BY MY SLAVES AND THEY ARE NOW IN A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE I PLACED HIM PUTTING ON SOME OF MY OWN LINEN AND TREATING HIM AS THEY WOULD DO MYSELF FETNAH'S HEART BEAT AT THESE WORDS OF THE JEWELLER
1594-135914-0074 AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMOTION FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHEW ME SAID SHE TO THE SYNDIC INTO THE SICK MAN'S ROOM I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM THE SYNDIC CONDUCTED HER AND WHILST SHE WAS GOING THITHER
1594-135914-0076 THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
1594-135914-0077 GANEM SAID SHE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE IS IT YOU I BEHOLD HAVING SPOKEN THESE WORDS SHE STOPPED TO GIVE THE YOUNG MAN TIME TO ANSWER BUT OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED INSENSIBLE ALAS GANEM ADDED SHE
1594-135914-0079 HOWEVER INDISPOSED WOULD KNOW THE VOICE OF FETNAH AT THE NAME OF FETNAH GANEM FOR IT WAS REALLY HE
1594-135914-0080 AH MADAM SAID HE BY WHAT MIRACLE HE COULD SAY NO MORE SUCH A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF JOY SEIZED HIM THAT HE FAINTED AWAY FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC DID ALL THEY COULD TO BRING HIM TO HIMSELF
1594-135914-0082 WHAT IS BECOME OF YOU CHARMING FETNAH DID YOU REALLY APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES OR WAS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION NO SIR SAID THE SYNDIC IT WAS NO ILLUSION IT WAS I THAT CAUSED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW
1594-135914-0083 BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
1594-135914-0085 THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
1594-135914-0086 EXHAUSTED BY HARD LIVING AND TOIL
1594-135914-0088 FETNAH THEN SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
1594-135914-0089 AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
1594-135914-0091 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM AND ALSO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
1594-135914-0092 AND SHE SATISFIED HIS INQUIRIES SAYING SO MANY THINGS IN COMMENDATION OF GANEM'S MOTHER AND SISTER HE DESIRED TO SEE THEM AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MERCHANT THOUGH HAROON AL RUSHEED WAS PASSIONATE AND IN HIS HEAT SOMETIMES GUILTY OF CRUEL ACTIONS
1594-135914-0094 THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
1594-135914-0095 GO BACK TO THAT YOUNG MERCHANT AND AS SOON AS HE HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH YOU SHALL BRING HIM TO ME WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE NEXT MORNING EARLY FETNAH REPAIRED TO THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS BEING IMPATIENT TO HEAR OF GANEM'S HEALTH AND TELL THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD FOR THEM
1594-135914-0097 REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
1594-135914-0098 BECAUSE THERE WAS GROUND TO FEAR THAT NOT KNOWING HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE AT BAGDAD THE SIGHT OF THEM MIGHT OCCASION TOO GREAT SURPRISE AND JOY IT WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT FETNAH SHOULD FIRST GO ALONE INTO GANEM'S CHAMBER
1594-135914-0100 YOU HAVE AGAIN FOUND YOUR FETNAH WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST FOR EVER
1594-135914-0101 WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT

1594-135914-0106 AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
1594-135914-0107 AND HE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS AT THE RELATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE THOUGHTS WHICH AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING MARRIED TO HIS MISTRESS BUT WHEN FETNAH INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN BAGDAD AND IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM
1594-135914-0109 THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
1594-135914-0110 WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
1594-135914-0112 AND HOW SHE HAD CLEARED HERSELF IN CONCLUSION WHEN THEY HAD RELATED WHAT ACCIDENTS HAD BEFALLEN THEM FETNAH SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND LET US THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE HAPPINESS THAT AWAITS US
1594-135914-0113 AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0115 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MAN OF A GOOD TASTE CHOSE SUCH AS WERE VERY HANDSOME AND HAD THEM MADE UP WITH ALL EXPEDITION THEY WERE FINISHED IN THREE DAYS AND GANEM FINDING HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH PREPARED TO GO ABROAD

1594-135914-0118 GANEM RETURNED NO OTHER ANSWER TO THE VIZIER'S COMPLIMENT THAN BY PROFOUNDLY BOWING HIS HEAD
1594-135914-0119 WHICH HE MANAGED VERY GRACEFULLY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BELONGING TO THE PALACE AND WHILST FETNAH ON ANOTHER MULE LED THEM BY A BYE WAY TO THE PRINCE'S COURT JAAFFIER CONDUCTED GANEM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE
1594-135914-0121 I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
1594-135914-0122 AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM GANEM I WILL HAVE YOU LIVE IN MY COURT COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MERCHANT A SLAVE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS MASTER'S ON WHOM HIS LIFE AND FORTUNE DEPEND
1594-135914-0124 NOT QUESTIONING BUT THAT FETNAH WAS IN WAITING WITH ABOU AYOUB'S WIDOW AND DAUGHTER HE CAUSED THEM TO BE CALLED IN THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE MADE THEM RISE AND WAS SO CHARMED BY JALIB AL KOOLLOOB'S BEAUTY
1594-135914-0125 THAT AFTER VIEWING HER VERY ATTENTIVELY HE SAID I AM SO SORRY FOR HAVING TREATED YOUR CHARMS SO UNWORTHILY THAT I OWE THEM SUCH A SATISFACTION AS MAY SURPASS THE INJURY I HAVE DONE I TAKE YOU TO WIFE

1624-142933-0005 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
1723-141149-0000 PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
1723-141149-0002 WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
1723-141149-0003 A GROUP OF FUEGIANS PARTLY CONCEALED BY THE ENTANGLED FOREST WERE PERCHED ON A WILD POINT OVERHANGING THE SEA AND AS WE PASSED BY THEY SPRANG UP AND WAVING THEIR TATTERED CLOAKS SENT FORTH A LOUD AND SONOROUS SHOUT THE SAVAGES FOLLOWED THE SHIP
1723-141149-0005 A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE LANDSCAPE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW ME HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT IT WAS FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER BEHELD AT NIGHT IT BLEW A GALE OF WIND AND HEAVY SQUALLS FROM THE MOUNTAINS SWEPT PAST US
1723-141149-0006 AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
1723-141149-0008 I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HOW WIDE WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED MAN IT IS GREATER THAN BETWEEN A WILD AND DOMESTICATED ANIMAL
1723-141149-0009 THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN WAS OLD AND APPEARED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE THREE OTHERS WERE POWERFUL YOUNG MEN ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN SENT AWAY THESE FUEGIANS ARE A VERY DIFFERENT RACE FROM THE STUNTED MISERABLE WRETCHES FARTHER WESTWARD
1723-141149-0011 HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0012 THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE ORNAMENTED BY STREAKS OF BLACK POWDER MADE OF CHARCOAL THE PARTY ALTOGETHER CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DEVILS WHICH COME ON THE STAGE IN PLAYS LIKE DER FREISCHUTZ THEIR VERY ATTITUDES WERE ABJECT
1723-141149-0014 AS PEOPLE DO WHEN FEEDING CHICKENS I WALKED WITH THE OLD MAN AND THIS DEMONSTRATION OF FRIENDSHIP WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS CONCLUDED BY THREE HARD SLAPS WHICH WERE GIVEN ME ON THE BREAST AND BACK AT THE SAME TIME HE THEN BARED HIS BOSOM FOR ME TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT WHICH BEING DONE
1723-141149-0015 HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
1723-141149-0017 SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
1723-141149-0018 WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
1723-141149-0020 AS COMPARED WITH THOSE LONG CIVILIZED WHEN A SONG WAS STRUCK UP BY OUR PARTY I THOUGHT THE FUEGIANS WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT WITH EQUAL SURPRISE THEY VIEWED OUR DANCING BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHEN ASKED HAD NO OBJECTION TO A LITTLE WALTZING
1723-141149-0021 LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO EUROPEANS AS THEY APPEARED TO BE YET THEY KNEW AND DREADED OUR FIRE ARMS NOTHING WOULD TEMPT THEM TO TAKE A GUN IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEGGED FOR KNIVES CALLING THEM BY THE SPANISH WORD
1723-141149-0023 DURING THE FORMER VOYAGE OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY CAPTAIN FITZ ROY SEIZED ON A PARTY OF NATIVES AS HOSTAGES FOR THE LOSS OF A BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN TO THE GREAT JEOPARDY OF A PARTY EMPLOYED ON THE SURVEY
1723-141149-0024 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0026 R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
1723-141149-0027 YORK MINSTER JEMMY BUTTON WHOSE NAME EXPRESSES HIS PURCHASE MONEY AND FUEGIA BASKET YORK MINSTER WAS A FULL GROWN SHORT THICK POWERFUL MAN HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESERVED TACITURN MOROSE
1723-141149-0029 HE WAS MERRY AND OFTEN LAUGHED AND WAS REMARKABLY SYMPATHETIC WITH ANY ONE IN PAIN WHEN THE WATER WAS ROUGH I WAS OFTEN A LITTLE SEA SICK AND HE USED TO COME TO ME AND SAY IN A PLAINTIVE VOICE POOR POOR FELLOW BUT THE NOTION AFTER HIS AQUATIC LIFE
1723-141149-0030 OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
1723-141149-0032 AND HE ABUSED ALL THE OTHER TRIBES HE STOUTLY DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO DEVIL IN HIS LAND JEMMY WAS SHORT THICK AND FAT BUT VAIN OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE USED ALWAYS TO WEAR GLOVES
1723-141149-0033 HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
1723-141149-0035 FUEGIA BASKET WAS A NICE MODEST RESERVED YOUNG GIRL WITH A RATHER PLEASING BUT SOMETIMES SULLEN EXPRESSION AND VERY QUICK IN LEARNING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY LANGUAGES THIS SHE SHOWED IN PICKING UP SOME PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH
1723-141149-0036 ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0041 BUT JEMMY UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND WAS MOREOVER THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHEN YORK MINSTER AFTERWARDS CAME ON SHORE THEY NOTICED HIM IN THE SAME WAY AND TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO SHAVE YET HE HAD NOT TWENTY DWARF HAIRS ON HIS FACE WHILST WE ALL WORE OUR UNTRIMMED BEARDS
1723-141149-0042 THEY EXAMINED THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN AND COMPARED IT WITH OURS ONE OF OUR ARMS BEING BARED THEY EXPRESSED THE LIVELIEST SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION AT ITS WHITENESS JUST IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE OURANGOUTANG DO AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
1723-141149-0044 THAT I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AFTER OUR FIRST FEELING OF GRAVE ASTONISHMENT WAS OVER NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE ODD MIXTURE OF SURPRISE AND IMITATION WHICH THESE SAVAGES EVERY MOMENT EXHIBITED
1723-141149-0045 THE NEXT DAY I ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY TIERRA DEL FUEGO MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAINOUS LAND PARTLY SUBMERGED IN THE SEA SO THAT DEEP INLETS AND BAYS OCCUPY THE PLACE WHERE VALLEYS SHOULD EXIST
1723-141149-0047 AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY A BAND OF PEAT WITH MINUTE ALPINE PLANTS AND THIS AGAIN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN KING IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN DESCENDS TO BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET
1723-141149-0048 IS MOST RARE I RECOLLECT ONLY ONE LITTLE FLAT PIECE NEAR PORT FAMINE AND ANOTHER OF RATHER LARGER EXTENT NEAR GOEREE ROAD IN BOTH PLACES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE THE SURFACE IS COVERED BY A THICK BED OF SWAMPY PEAT EVEN WITHIN THE FOREST
1723-141149-0050 AT FIRST FROM THE WATERFALLS AND NUMBER OF DEAD TREES I COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG BUT THE BED OF THE STREAM SOON BECAME A LITTLE MORE OPEN FROM THE FLOODS HAVING SWEPT THE SIDES I CONTINUED SLOWLY TO ADVANCE FOR AN HOUR ALONG THE BROKEN AND ROCKY BANKS
1723-141149-0051 AND WAS AMPLY REPAID BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF THE RAVINE WELL ACCORDED WITH THE UNIVERSAL SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ON EVERY SIDE WERE LYING IRREGULAR MASSES OF ROCK AND TORN UP TREES OTHER TREES THOUGH STILL ERECT
1723-141149-0053 HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
1723-141149-0054 FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0056 ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
1723-141149-0057 WE FOLLOWED THE SAME WATER COURSE AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY TILL IT DWINDLED AWAY AND WE WERE THEN COMPELLED TO CRAWL BLINDLY AMONG THE TREES THESE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE ELEVATION AND OF THE IMPETUOUS WINDS WERE LOW THICK AND CROOKED
1723-141149-0059 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0060 A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
1723-141149-0062 AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
1723-141149-0063 WELL BECOMING TIERRA DEL FUEGO THERE WAS A DEGREE OF MYSTERIOUS GRANDEUR IN MOUNTAIN BEHIND MOUNTAIN WITH THE DEEP INTERVENING VALLEYS ALL COVERED BY ONE THICK DUSKY MASS OF FOREST THE ATMOSPHERE LIKEWISE IN THIS CLIMATE
1723-141149-0065 AND ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY FAVOURED TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE BY A FINE EASTERLY BREEZE WE CLOSED IN WITH THE BARNEVELTS AND RUNNING PAST CAPE DECEIT WITH ITS STONY PEAKS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK DOUBLED THE WEATHER BEATEN CAPE HORN THE EVENING WAS CALM AND BRIGHT
1723-141149-0066 AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
1723-141149-0068 THAT THE CAPTAIN DETERMINED TO RUN INTO WIGWAM COVE THIS IS A SNUG LITTLE HARBOUR NOT FAR FROM CAPE HORN AND HERE AT CHRISTMAS EVE WE ANCHORED IN SMOOTH WATER THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED US OF THE GALE OUTSIDE
1723-141149-0069 WAS EVERY NOW AND THEN A PUFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHICH MADE THE SHIP SURGE AT HER ANCHORS
1723-141149-0071 MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTREMITY OF THE SUBMERGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE COVE TAKES ITS NAME OF WIGWAM FROM SOME OF THE FUEGIAN HABITATIONS BUT EVERY BAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT BE SO CALLED WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THE INHABITANTS
1723-141149-0072 LIVING CHIEFLY UPON SHELL FISH ARE OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO CHANGE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT THEY RETURN AT INTERVALS TO THE SAME SPOTS AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE PILES OF OLD SHELLS WHICH MUST OFTEN AMOUNT TO MANY TONS IN FREIGHT
1723-141149-0074 AND IT IS ONLY USED FOR A FEW DAYS AT GOEREE ROADS I SAW A PLACE WHERE ONE OF THESE NAKED MEN HAD SLEPT WHICH ABSOLUTELY OFFERED NO MORE COVER THAN THE FORM OF A HARE THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY LIVING BY HIMSELF
1723-141149-0075 ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
1723-141149-0077 FROM THE DAMP AND BOISTEROUS STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
1723-141149-0078 ONE FANCIED THE CLIMATE EVEN WORSE THAN IT REALLY WAS WHILE GOING ONE DAY ON SHORE NEAR WOLLASTON ISLAND WE PULLED ALONGSIDE A CANOE WITH SIX FUEGIANS THESE WERE THE MOST ABJECT AND MISERABLE CREATURES I ANYWHERE BEHELD
1723-141149-0080 WHICH IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR BACKS AS LOW DOWN AS THEIR LOINS IT IS LACED ACROSS THE BREAST BY STRINGS AND ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLOWS IT IS SHIFTED FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT THESE FUEGIANS IN THE CANOE WERE QUITE NAKED AND EVEN ONE FULL GROWN WOMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY SO
1723-141149-0081 IT WAS RAINING HEAVILY AND THE FRESH WATER TOGETHER WITH THE SPRAY TRICKLED DOWN HER BODY IN ANOTHER HARBOUR NOT FAR DISTANT A WOMAN WHO WAS SUCKLING A RECENTLY BORN CHILD CAME ONE DAY ALONGSIDE THE VESSEL AND REMAINED THERE OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY
1723-141149-0083 HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
1723-141149-0084 WHENEVER IT IS LOW WATER WINTER OR SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY THEY MUST RISE TO PICK SHELL FISH FROM THE ROCKS AND THE WOMEN EITHER DIVE TO COLLECT SEA EGGS OR SIT PATIENTLY IN THEIR CANOES AND WITH A BAITED HAIR LINE WITHOUT ANY HOOK JERK OUT LITTLE FISH
1723-141149-0086 I HEARD MISTER LOW A SEALING MASTER INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY GIVE A CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF A PARTY OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NATIVES ON THE WEST COAST WHO WERE VERY THIN AND IN GREAT DISTRESS
1723-141149-0087 A SUCCESSION OF GALES PREVENTED THE WOMEN FROM GETTING SHELL FISH ON THE ROCKS AND THEY COULD NOT GO OUT IN THEIR CANOES TO CATCH SEAL A SMALL PARTY OF THESE MEN ONE MORNING SET OUT AND THE OTHER INDIANS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY FOR FOOD
1723-141149-0089 WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
1723-141149-0090 THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
1723-141149-0092 HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
1723-141149-0093 BUT THAT THEY ARE PURSUED BY THE MEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY COULD NEVER ASCERTAIN THAT THE FUEGIANS HAVE ANY DISTINCT BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR DEAD IN CAVES
1723-141149-0095 THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
1723-141149-0096 THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
1723-141149-0098 IN A WILD AND EXCITED MANNER HE ALSO RELATED THAT HIS BROTHER ONE DAY WHILST RETURNING TO PICK UP SOME DEAD BIRDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST OBSERVED SOME FEATHERS BLOWN BY THE WIND HIS BROTHER SAID YORK IMITATING HIS MANNER WHAT THAT
1723-141149-0099 AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
1723-141149-0101 HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
1723-141149-0102 BUT OTHER OBSCURE SPEECHES MADE ME DOUBT THIS I HAVE SOMETIMES IMAGINED THAT THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THEY WERE INSANE THE DIFFERENT TRIBES HAVE NO GOVERNMENT OR CHIEF YET EACH IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER HOSTILE TRIBES SPEAKING DIFFERENT DIALECTS
1723-141149-0104 AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
1723-141149-0105 THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
1723-141149-0107 FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
1723-141149-0108 THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
1723-141149-0110 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1723-141149-0111 THEREFORE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THEY ENJOY A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF HAPPINESS OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE TO RENDER LIFE WORTH HAVING
1737-142396-0001 WHILE THERE GREW UP IN ME AS IN THE PARALLEL CASE OF CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS A VAGUE SENSE OF A RULING POWER WILFUL AND FREAKISH AND PRONE TO THE PRACTICE OF VAGARIES JUST CHOOSING SO
1737-142396-0002 BUT ONLY A CERTAIN BLEND OF ENVY OF THEIR GOOD LUCK AND PITY FOR THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF IT INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS FEATURES IN THEIR CHARACTER WHEN WE TROUBLED OURSELVES TO WASTE A THOUGHT ON THEM WHICH WASN'T OFTEN
1737-142396-0004 YET THEY WENT THERE REGULARLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOUGH THEY BETRAYED NO GREATER DELIGHT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAN OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE OLYMPIANS SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY VOID OF INTERESTS
1737-142396-0005 EVEN AS THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE CONFINED AND SLOW AND THEIR HABITS STEREOTYPED AND SENSELESS TO ANYTHING BUT APPEARANCES THEY WERE BLIND
1737-142396-0007 THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
1737-142396-0008 THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CURATE WHO WOULD RECEIVE UNBLENCHING THE INFORMATION THAT THE MEADOW BEYOND THE ORCHARD WAS A PRAIRIE STUDDED WITH HERDS OF BUFFALO WHICH IT WAS OUR DELIGHT MOCCASINED AND TOMAHAWKED TO RIDE DOWN WITH THOSE WHOOPS THAT ANNOUNCE THE SCENTING OF BLOOD
1737-142396-0010 THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
1737-142396-0011 I TRUST HE IS A BISHOP BY THIS TIME HE HAD ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS AS WE KNEW THESE STRANGE FOLK HAD VISITORS SOMETIMES STIFF AND COLOURLESS OLYMPIANS LIKE THEMSELVES EQUALLY WITHOUT VITAL INTERESTS AND INTELLIGENT PURSUITS
1737-142396-0013 SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN
1737-142396-0014 HOW COULD REASONABLE PEOPLE SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS TIME SO
1737-142396-0016 UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
1737-142396-0017 WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
1737-142396-0019 OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
1737-142396-0020 BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
1737-142396-0022 WELL THE OLYMPIANS ARE ALL PAST AND GONE SOMEHOW THE SUN DOES NOT SEEM TO SHINE SO BRIGHTLY AS IT USED THE TRACKLESS MEADOWS OF OLD TIME HAVE SHRUNK AND DWINDLED AWAY TO A FEW POOR ACRES
1737-142396-0023 A SADDENING DOUBT A DULL SUSPICION CREEPS OVER ME ET IN ARCADIA EGO
1737-142397-0001 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
1737-142397-0002 SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
1737-142397-0004 FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
1737-142397-0005 OH HE'S JUST PLAYIN MUFFIN MAN AS USUAL SAID CHARLOTTE WITH PETULANCE FANCY WANTING TO BE A MUFFIN MAN ON A WHOLE HOLIDAY IT WAS A STRANGE CRAZE CERTAINLY BUT HAROLD WHO INVENTED HIS OWN GAMES AND PLAYED THEM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
1737-142397-0007 AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
1737-142397-0008 TO PASS ALONG BUSY STREETS OF YOUR OWN BUILDING FOR EVER RINGING AN IMAGINARY BELL AND OFFERING AIRY MUFFINS OF YOUR OWN MAKE TO A BUSTLING THRONGING CROWD OF YOUR OWN CREATION THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THE GAME IT CANNOT BE DENIED THOUGH IT SEEMED SCARCE IN HARMONY WITH THIS RADIANT WIND SWEPT MORNING
1737-142397-0010 BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
1737-142397-0011 AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
1737-142397-0013 HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED
1737-142397-0014 AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
1737-142397-0016 AT EACH STEP GROWING LESS CHARLOTTE THE MUMMER OF A MINUTE AND MORE THE ANXIOUS PILGRIM OF ALL TIME THE LION'S WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE AT HER APPROACH HIS ROARING FILLED THE STARTLED AIR
1737-142397-0017 INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
1737-142397-0019 THE PANT AND SMOKE OF A DISTANT TRAIN ALL WERE WINE OR SONG WAS IT OR ODOUR THIS UNITY THEY ALL BLENDED INTO I HAD NO WORDS THEN TO DESCRIBE IT THAT EARTH EFFLUENCE OF WHICH I WAS SO CONSCIOUS NOR INDEED HAVE I FOUND WORDS SINCE
1737-142397-0020 I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
1737-142397-0022 RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
1737-142397-0023 A BELATED TRUANT YOU HAVE DRAGGED A WEARY FOOT HOMEWARD WITH ONLY A PALE EXPRESSIONLESS MOON FOR COMPANY TO DAY WHY NOT I THE TRICKSTER THE HYPOCRITE I WHO WHIP ROUND CORNERS AND BLUSTER RELAPSE AND EVADE THEN RALLY AND PURSUE
1737-142397-0025 SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
1737-142397-0026 SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
1737-142397-0028 AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
1737-142397-0029 AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
1737-142397-0031 THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
1737-142397-0032 AND I FELT SURE AS I RAMBLED OFF IN HIS WAKE THAT HE HAD MORE HOLIDAY MATTER TO SHOW ME AND SO INDEED HE HAD AND ALL OF IT WAS TO THE SAME LAWLESS TUNE LIKE A BLACK PIRATE FLAG ON THE BLUE OCEAN OF AIR A HAWK HUNG OMINOUS THEN PLUMMET WISE DROPPED TO THE HEDGEROW
1737-142397-0034 TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
1737-142397-0035 A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1737-142397-0037 I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
1737-142397-0038 PERHAPS TOO AT A SPECIAL BIT OF WAGGISHNESS HE HAD STILL IN STORE FOR WHEN AT LAST HE GREW WEARY OF SUCH INSIGNIFICANT EARTHBOUND COMPANY HE DESERTED ME AT A CERTAIN SPOT I KNEW THEN DROPPED SUBSIDED AND SLUNK AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
1737-142397-0040 HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
1737-142397-0041 HAROLD IT FURTHER APPEARED GREATLY COVETING TADPOLES AND TOP HEAVY WITH THE EAGERNESS OF POSSESSION HAD FALLEN INTO THE POND THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOTHING BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO SNEAK IN

1737-148989-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN WAITING
1737-148989-0001 SAID PROFESSOR BHAER COMING IN ONE DAY EARLY IN JANUARY PLEASE TELL IT AT ONCE I CAN'T BEAR TO WAIT FRITZ CRIED MISSUS JO DROPPING HER WORK AND STANDING UP AS IF TO TAKE THE SHOT BRAVELY BUT WE MUST WAIT AND HOPE HEART'S DEAREST COME
1737-148989-0003 AND SITTING BY HER GOOD MAN HEARD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL TIDINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SHIPOWNERS AT HAMBURG BY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AND TELEGRAPHED AT ONCE BY FRANZ TO HIS UNCLE AS ONE BOAT LOAD WAS SAFE
1737-148989-0004 THERE WAS HOPE THAT OTHERS MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE THOUGH THE GALE HAD SENT TWO TO THE BOTTOM A SWIFT SAILING STEAMER HAD BROUGHT THESE SCANTY NEWS AND HAPPIER ONES MIGHT COME AT ANY HOUR BUT KIND FRANZ HAD NOT ADDED THAT THE SAILORS REPORTED THE CAPTAIN'S BOAT AS UNDOUBTEDLY WRECKED BY THE FALLING MAST
1737-148989-0006 FRANZ KEPT THE CABLE BUSY WITH HIS VARYING MESSAGES NAT SENT LOVING LETTERS FROM LEIPZIG AND TOM HARASSED THE SHIPPING AGENTS FOR NEWS EVEN BUSY JACK WROTE THEM WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
1737-148989-0007 DOLLY AND GEORGE CAME OFTEN BEARING THE LOVELIEST FLOWERS AND THE DAINTIEST BON BONS TO CHEER MISSUS BHAER AND SWEETEN JOSIE'S GRIEF WHILE GOOD HEARTED NED TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM CHICAGO TO PRESS THEIR HANDS AND SAY WITH A TEAR IN HIS EYE
1737-148989-0009 HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
1737-148989-0010 NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
1737-148989-0012 AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
1737-148989-0013 FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
1737-148989-0015 SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
1737-148989-0016 THEN UP WENT THE FLAG OUT RANG THE COLLEGE BELLS BANG WENT TEDDY'S LONG UNUSED CANNON AND A CHORUS OF HAPPY VOICES CRIED THANK GOD AS PEOPLE WENT ABOUT LAUGHING CRYING AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN A RAPTURE OF DELIGHT
1737-148989-0018 AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
1737-148989-0019 TEDDY STOOD ON HIS HEAD LITERALLY AND TORE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ON OCTOO LIKE A SECOND PAUL REVERE ONLY HIS TIDINGS WERE GOOD BUT BEST OF ALL LITTLE JOSIE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS THE SNOWDROPS DID AND BEGAN TO BLOOM AGAIN GROWING TALL AND QUIET
1737-148989-0021 THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
1737-148989-0022 THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
1737-148989-0024 QUITE THORNY WAS IT IN FACT AND HARD TO TRAVEL AFTER THE TASTE OF EASE AND PLEASURE HE HAD GOT WHEN NIBBLING AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT BUT HIS CROP OF WILD OATS WAS A LIGHT ONE AND HE RESOLUTELY REAPED WHAT HE HAD SOWED FINDING SOME GOOD WHEAT AMONG THE TARES HE TAUGHT BY DAY
1737-148989-0025 HE FIDDLED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE DINGY LITTLE THEATRE AND HE STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY THAT HIS MASTER WAS WELL PLEASED AND KEPT HIM IN MIND AS ONE TO WHOM PREFERMENT WAS DUE IF ANY CHANCE OCCURRED GAY FRIENDS FORGOT HIM BUT THE OLD ONES STOOD FAST
1737-148989-0027 AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
1737-148989-0028 SO HE WALKED UNDER THE LINDENS WITH A LIGHTER HEART AND IN THE MAY EVENINGS WENT ABOUT THE CITY WITH A BAND OF STROLLING STUDENTS MAKING MUSIC BEFORE HOUSES WHERE HE USED TO SIT AS GUEST
1737-148989-0030 THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
1737-148989-0031 AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
1737-148989-0033 HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
1737-148989-0034 HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
1737-148989-0036 HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
1737-148989-0037 THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
1737-148989-0039 AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
1737-148989-0040 AS HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT HAD DONE SINCE A CERTAIN LITTLE WHITE HAND HAD LAID IN IT CONFIDINGLY I'LL MAKE EM PROUD OF ME YET AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THIS AWFUL YEAR I CAN WIPE IT OUT AND I WILL SO HELP ME GOD
1743-142912-0001 HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T RECALL THOSE TWO COUSINS OF CHEBEC'S DID YOU SAY YOUR FIGHTING COUSIN HE ASKED IN A HESITATING WAY THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED CHEBEC HE IS SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW
1743-142912-0002 THE REST OF US ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN HE IS ABOUT OF COURSE I KNOW HIM DECLARED PETER HIS FACE CLEARING WHERE IS HE NOW
1743-142912-0004 OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
1743-142912-0005 AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY FOR A MINUTE PETER COULDN'T THINK WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH REDTAIL AND THEN HE SAW
1743-142912-0007 HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1743-142912-0008 HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
1743-142912-0010 SCRAPPER FLEW BACK AND PERCHED ON A DEAD BRANCH OF ONE OF THE TREES WHERE HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF ALL HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS HE TOOK THEM QUITE MODESTLY ASSURING THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING
1743-142912-0011 PETER COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE SCRAPPER FOR HIS COURAGE AS PETER LOOKED UP AT SCRAPPER HE SAW THAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE FLYCATCHERS THERE WAS JUST THE TINIEST OF HOOKS ON THE END OF HIS BILL
1743-142912-0013 AND HIS BILL SNAPPED IN QUITE THE SAME WAY CHEBEC'S DID WHEN HE CAUGHT A FLY BUT IT WASN'T A FLY THAT SCRAPPER HAD IT WAS A BEE PETER SAW IT VERY DISTINCTLY JUST AS SCRAPPER SNAPPED IT UP
1743-142912-0014 IT REMINDED PETER THAT HE HAD OFTEN HEARD SCRAPPER CALLED THE BEE MARTIN AND NOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHY DO YOU LIVE ON BEES ALTOGETHER ASKED PETER
1743-142912-0016 THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0017 I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
1743-142912-0019 BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
1743-142912-0020 ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IN THE OLD ORCHARD THIS YEAR ASKED PETER OF COURSE I AM DECLARED SCRAPPER I JUST THEN HE SPIED BLACKY THE CROW AND DASHED OUT TO MEET HIM
1743-142912-0022 JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
1743-142912-0023 EVERY WAY BUT THE RIGHT WAY LOOK UP OVER YOUR HEAD CRIED THE VOICE RATHER A HARSH VOICE
1743-142912-0025 HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
1743-142912-0026 YOU SEEM TO BE IN A HURRY SO DON'T LET ME DETAIN YOU PETER SAID CRESTY BEFORE PETER COULD FIND HIS TONGUE I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE LITTLE FAVOR OF YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED PETER WHO
1743-142912-0028 A WHAT STAMMERED PETER A CAST OFF SUIT OF CLOTHES FROM ANY MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY REPLIED CRESTY SOMEWHAT IMPATIENTLY NOW DON'T FORGET PETER I'VE GOT TO GO HOUSE HUNTING BUT YOU'LL FIND ME THERE OR HEREABOUTS IF IT HAPPENS THAT YOU FIND ONE OF THOSE
1743-142912-0029 CAST OFF SNAKE SUITS BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD CRESTY HAD FLOWN AWAY PETER HESITATED LOOKING FIRST TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH AND THEN TOWARDS JENNY WREN'S HOUSE
1743-142912-0031 JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
1743-142912-0032 THIS TIME JENNY POPPED HER HEAD OUT AND HER LITTLE EYES FAIRLY SNAPPED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER DAY PETER RABBIT THAT I'M NOT TO BE DISTURBED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I'VE GOT SEVEN EGGS IN HERE AND THAT I CAN'T SPEND ANY TIME GOSSIPING
1743-142912-0034 GO TO FOR WHAT SNAPPED JENNY WREN WHAT IS IT YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR SNAKE SKINS REPLIED PETER SNAKE SKINS SNAKE SKINS SHRIEKED JENNY WREN
1743-142912-0035 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CRIED PETER HURRIEDLY WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY SHOULD CRESTY THE FLYCATCHER ASK ME TO PLEASE LET HIM KNOW IF I FOUND ANY CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY
1743-142913-0000 WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0001 HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0003 IT DIDN'T TAKE PETER LONG TO FIND PEWEE HE JUST FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THAT VOICE AND PRESENTLY SAW PEWEE FLY OUT AND MAKE THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE CIRCLE AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MAKE WHEN THEY ARE HUNTING FLIES
1743-142913-0004 IT ENDED JUST WHERE IT HAD STARTED ON A DEAD TWIG OF A TREE IN A SHADY RATHER LONELY PART OF THE GREEN FOREST ALMOST AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS NAME IN A RATHER SAD PLAINTIVE TONE PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE
1743-142913-0006 THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BILL WAS BLACK BUT THE LOWER HALF WAS LIGHT PETER COULD SEE ON EACH WING TWO WHITISH BARS AND HE NOTICED THAT PEWEE'S WINGS WERE LONGER THAN HIS TAIL WHICH WASN'T THE CASE WITH CHEBEC
1743-142913-0007 BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0009 IT IS SO QUIET AND RESTFUL THAT I LOVE IT MISSUS PEWEE AND I ARE VERY RETIRING WE DO NOT LIKE TOO MANY NEAR NEIGHBORS YOU WON'T MIND IF I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE IN A WHILE WILL YOU ASKED PETER AS HE PREPARED TO START ON AGAIN FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
1743-142913-0010 COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0012 BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0013 IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY THING FOR CRESTY TO ASK FOR THAT PETER'S CURIOSITY WOULD ALLOW HIM NO PEACE AND THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS UP IN THE OLD ORCHARD BEFORE JOLLY MISTER SUN HAD KICKED HIS BEDCLOTHES OFF
1743-142913-0015 THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0016 PERHAPS THEY THINK IT WILL SCARE ROBBERS AWAY AS FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE A COLD CHILL EVERY TIME I GOT INTO MY NEST IF I HAD TO SIT ON ANYTHING LIKE THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ARE A HANDSOME COUPLE
1743-142913-0018 IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0019 WHERE ARE YOUR EYES PETER DID YOU EVER SEE A FLYCATCHER WITH A BILL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT COULD CUT WOOD SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR A REPLY BUT RATTLED ON IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A LOT OF US THAT THE WOODPECKER FAMILY ARE SO FOND OF NEW HOUSES LOOK
1743-142913-0021 I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS SOMETHING SETTLED ABOUT AN OLD HOUSE IT DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION THE WAY A NEW ONE DOES SO LONG AS IT HAS GOT REASONABLY GOOD WALLS AND THE RAIN AND THE WIND CAN'T GET IN
1743-142913-0022 THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0024 I'VE NOTICED THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF THE SAME HOUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE AGAIN JENNY WREN NODDED YANK YANK THE NUTHATCH USES AN OLD HOUSE I'M TOLD BUT HE USUALLY GOES UP NORTH FOR HIS NESTING SAID SHE
1743-142913-0025 TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE SOMETIMES USES AN OLD HOUSE THEN AGAIN HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE GET FUSSY AND MAKE A HOUSE FOR THEMSELVES YELLOW WING THE FLICKER WHO REALLY IS A WOODPECKER OFTEN USES AN OLD HOUSE BUT QUITE OFTEN MAKES A NEW ONE
1743-142913-0027 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US IF THEY DIDN'T NEST AT ALL BUT THEY DO AND AN OLD HOUSE OF YELLOW WING THE FLICKER SUITS EITHER OF THEM KILLY ALWAYS USES ONE THAT IS HIGH UP AND COMES BACK TO IT YEAR AFTER YEAR
1743-142913-0028 SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0030 ONE IS ALL I CAN TAKE CARE OF THEN WHY DEMANDED PETER TRIUMPHANTLY DOES MISTER WREN WORK ALL DAY CARRYING STICKS AND STRAWS INTO A HOLE IN ANOTHER TREE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS CARRIED ENOUGH IN THERE TO BUILD TWO OR THREE NESTS
1743-142914-0000 HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0002 OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR THE SMILING POOL HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST UNTIL HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK COMES OUT OF THE GREEN FOREST ON ITS WAY TO THE SMILING POOL IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
1743-142914-0003 BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES GROW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAUGHING BROOK AT THIS POINT THE GROUND WAS SOFT IN PLACES QUITE MUDDY PETER DOESN'T MIND GETTING HIS FEET DAMP SO HE HOPPED ALONG CARELESSLY
1743-142914-0005 HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006 HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0008 I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
1743-142914-0009 I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
1743-142914-0011 LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0012 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0014 HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0017 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018 PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0020 AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021 LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0023 THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024 HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0026 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027 EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0029 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030 JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1841-150351-0000 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0003 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0006 THEY DID NOT CULTIVATE THE SOIL NOR DID THEY HUNT A GREAT DEAL ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY ABOUNDED WITH GAME
1841-150351-0007 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0009 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0012 THE BASKETS ARE STILL MADE IN SOME PLACES AND ARE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF THEIR BEAUTY THE INDIANS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THEIR HOMES DUG ROUND SHALLOW HOLES OVER WHICH POLES WERE BENT IN THE FORM OF A HALF CIRCLE
1841-150351-0013 AND AFTER HE HAD ENTERED AND ALL OPENINGS WERE CLOSED HE POURED WATER UPON THE STONES UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH STEAM AFTER ENDURING THIS PROCESS AS LONG AS HE DESIRED THE INDIAN CAME OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE COLD WATER OF A NEAR BY STREAM
1841-150351-0015 AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
1841-150351-0016 AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0021 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0022 LARGE POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AT THE CORNERS AND ENDS OF THE BUILDING CROSS LOGS ARE THEN PLACED UPON THE MIDDLE POSTS
1841-150351-0024 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0027 THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS CARVED UPON IT REPRESENT THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS OF THE FAMILY OR CLAN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ABODE THE POLE STANDS THE INDIANS OFTEN HUNT SIMILAR ANIMALS TO DAY
1841-150351-0028 BUT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SUPERNATURAL POWER WHICH RAISED THEM ABOVE THE ORDINARY CREATURES THE CHINOOK INDIANS LIVE UPON THE LOWER COLUMBIA
1841-150351-0030 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-150351-0031 IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE AMERICAN INDIANS ORIGINALLY CAME ACROSS THE NARROW STRIP OF WATER SEPARATING ASIA FROM AMERICA WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED OUR COUNTRY
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
1867-148436-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE FIRST DAY MILE AFTER MILE OF THE ROUGH TRAIL FELL BEHIND HIM AND STILL THE PONY SHAMBLED ALONG AT A LOOSE TROT OR A SWINGING CANTER THE STEEP UPGRADES IT TOOK AT A STEADY JOG

1867-154071-0001 FOUND A BIG DOUBLE ROOM THAT RAN ACROSS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK IT LOOKED DOWN ON THE LIGHTS GLIMMERING ON THE BLACK EAST RIVER AND ACROSS TO THE FLARE OF BROOKLYN TO THE LEFT THE WHOLE ARC OF THE FIFTY NINTH STREET BRIDGE WAS EXPOSED
1867-154071-0002 HERE THEY TOOK UP THE VIGIL
1867-154071-0004 GO ON BACK TO SLEEP I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
1867-154071-0005 GHOST HOURS OF THE EARLY MORNING THEY DID NOT RELAX THEIR VIGIL
1867-154071-0007 BY THIS TIME THE NERVES OF THE TWO WATCHERS WERE SHATTERED BY THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND THE MONOTONOUS VIEW FROM THE FRONT WINDOW WAS BEGINNING TO MADDEN THEM IT'S PROOF THAT SHE AIN'T YONDER SAID BILL GREGG
1867-154071-0008 AND HE GREW PALE AT THE THOUGHT PARTNER SAID RONICKY DOONE IF THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM US THEY SURE HAVE THE SENSE TO KEEP HER UNDER COVER FOR AS LONG AS TWO DAYS AIN'T THAT RIGHT
1867-154071-0010 ONE WEEK WAS DECIDED ON AS A FAIR TEST IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME CAROLINE SMITH DID NOT COME OUT OF THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET THEY COULD CONCLUDE THAT SHE DID NOT STAY THERE
1867-154071-0011 PEERING THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE DRAWN CURTAINS WHICH SHELTERED HIM FROM BEING OBSERVED AT HIS SPYING WHEN HE CALLED OUT SOFTLY THE SOUND BROUGHT GREGG WITH ONE LONG LEAP OUT OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING TO THE WINDOW THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT IT
1867-154071-0013 SNATCHED HIS HAT AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DOOR AND RONICKY HEARD THE BRIEF THUNDER OF HIS FEET DOWN THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEN THE HEAVY THUMPS AS HE RACED AROUND THE LANDING
1867-154071-0014 AND SO SWIFT WAS THAT DESCENT THAT WHEN THE GIRL IDLING DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE STREET CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK BILL GREGG RUSHED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND RAN TOWARD HER
1867-154071-0016 SHE WORE A BLACK STRAW HAT TURNED BACK FROM HER FACE WITH A SINGLE BIG RED FLOWER AT THE SIDE OF IT
1867-154071-0017 THE SAME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR CLOTHES WAS IN THEIR FACES THE FINELY MODELED PRETTINESS OF HER FEATURES AND THE BIG CARELESS CHISELING OF THE FEATURES OF BILL GREGG RONICKY DOONE DID NOT WONDER THAT AFTER HER FIRST FEAR HER GESTURE WAS ONE OF DISDAIN AND SURPRISE
1867-154071-0019 RONICKY DOONE FOLLOWED THAT GLANCE AND HE SAW ALL HIDDEN SAVE THE PROFILE OF THE FACE
1867-154071-0020 WHAT A FACE IT WAS NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD RONICKY DOONE SEEN A MAN WHO IN ONE INSTANT FILLED HIM WITH SUCH FEAR AND HATRED SUCH LOATHING AND SUCH DREAD SUCH SCORN AND SUCH TERROR
1867-154071-0022 THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
1867-154071-0023 FOR SHE MADE A SLIGHT OUTWARD GESTURE WITH ONE HAND IF THIS WERE IN HER MIND HOWEVER IT VANISHED INSTANTLY SHE TURNED WITH A SHUDDER AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET
1867-154071-0025 WHAT A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ASCENT AND THE DESCENT HE HAD LITERALLY FLOWN DOWN NOW HIS HEELS CLUMPED OUT A SLOW AND REGULAR DEATH MARCH AS HE CAME BACK TO THE ROOM WHEN GREGG OPENED THE DOOR
1867-154071-0026 RONICKY DOONE BLINKED AND DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AT THE SIGHT OF THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE GREGG HAD KNOWN BEFORE THAT HE TRULY LOVED THIS GIRL WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN
1867-154071-0028 AFTER THAT HE DID NOT MOVE SO MUCH AS A FINGER FROM THE POSITION INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN LIMPLY HIS LEGS WERE TWISTED AWKWARDLY SPRAWLING ACROSS THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIM ONE LONG ARM DRAGGED DOWN TOWARD THE FLOOR
1867-154071-0029 AS IF THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN IT TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE LABOR HARDENED HANDS HIS CHIN WAS FALLEN AGAINST HIS BREAST WHEN RONICKY DOONE CROSSED TO HIM AND LAID A KIND HAND ON HIS SHOULDER HE DID NOT LOOK UP IT'S ENDED
1867-154071-0031 SAID RONICKY DOONE BILL LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME MAN TO MAN THAT YOU'RE A LIAR HE ADDED CAN YOU EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER MAN THE CRUELTY OF THAT SPEECH MADE GREGG FLUSH
1867-154071-0032 SAID GREGG HUSKILY AIN'T THERE THAT'S WHERE YOU AND ME DON'T AGREE

1898-145715-0002 SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
1898-145715-0004 SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
1898-145715-0005 AT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM
1898-145715-0007 SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
1898-145715-0008 SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
1898-145715-0010 THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
1898-145715-0011 HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
1898-145715-0013 COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
1898-145715-0014 LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
1898-145715-0016 AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
1898-145715-0017 AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
1898-145715-0019 SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
1898-145715-0020 CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
1898-145715-0022 AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
1898-145715-0023 THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
1898-145715-0025 IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
1898-145715-0026 THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
1898-145715-0028 STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
1898-145715-0029 AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
1898-145715-0031 SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
1898-145715-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
1898-145715-0034 SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE
1898-145715-0035 HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
1898-145715-0037 BEGGED HER NOT TO LOSE HEART AND ASSURED HER THAT HER TROUBLES SHOULD BE REWARDED SHE ACCOMPANIED HER ADVICE BY THE GIFT OF A CRYSTAL SMELLING BOTTLE WITH STRICT ORDERS ONLY TO OPEN IT IN CASE OF URGENT NEED
1898-145715-0038 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
1898-145715-0040 THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
1898-145715-0041 YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
1898-145715-0043 WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
1898-145715-0044 ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
1898-145715-0046 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
1898-145715-0047 IN THE FIRST AND MOST SPLENDID OF THESE CARRIAGES SAT PRINCE RAINBOW'S MOTHER SHE FONDLY EMBRACED HER SON AFTER WHICH SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THAT THE ANGER OF THE FAIRIES WAS AT LENGTH APPEASED
1898-145715-0049 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
1898-145715-0050 CHARMS WOULD WIN ALL HEARTS WHEN THE THREE GREEN AND WHITE SISTERS APPEARED THEY DECLARED THE SECRET OF FAIRY THAN A FAIRY'S ROYAL BIRTH AND THE QUEEN TAKING THE TWO LOVERS IN HER CARRIAGE SET OFF WITH THEM FOR THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
1898-145720-0001 MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
1898-145720-0002 BUT FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET HE SAT BY THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS LAID THINKING OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT WAS BURIED THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME TO HIM OUT OF THE DARKNESS
1898-145720-0004 SO THE NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP EARLY AND PUT SOME FOOD IN HIS POUCH AND SLUNG AN EXTRA SKIN OVER HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG HIS JOURNEY WOULD TAKE NOR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONLY ONE THING HE KNEW
1898-145720-0005 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SAY THAT THE LAND OF SOULS LAY TO THE SOUTH AND SO FILLED WITH NEW HOPE AND COURAGE HE SET HIS FACE SOUTHWARDS FOR MANY MANY MILES THE COUNTRY LOOKED THE SAME AS IT DID ROUND HIS OWN HOME
1898-145720-0007 AND ON THE TOP OF THESE HE FOUND A HUT OR WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND HOLDING A STAFF IN HIS HAND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
1898-145720-0008 REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
1898-145720-0010 AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
1898-145720-0011 BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
1898-145720-0013 VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
1898-145720-0014 WHEN TO HIS JOY AND WONDER HE SAW FOLLOWING HIM IN ANOTHER CANOE EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN THE MAIDEN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD MADE THIS LONG JOURNEY BUT THEY COULD NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER FOR BETWEEN THEM ROLLED GREAT WAVES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY WOULD SINK THE BOATS
1898-145720-0016 SO THEY REACHED UNHURT THE SHORE OF THE HAPPY ISLAND AND WANDERED THROUGH THE FLOWERY FIELDS AND BY THE BANKS OF RUSHING STREAMS AND THEY KNEW NOT HUNGER NOR THIRST NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT
1898-145720-0017 BUT IN THE MURMUR OF THE WIND HE HEARD THE MASTER OF LIFE SAYING TO HIM RETURN WHITHER YOU CAME FOR I HAVE WORK FOR YOU TO DO AND YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU AND FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHALL RULE OVER THEM
1898-145724-0000 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN WHO BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT OF THE DITCH THE PRINCE BENT DOWN AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HER LIVING GRAVE ASKING HER AT THE SAME TIME HOW SHE HAD MANAGED TO GET THERE MY SON
1898-145724-0001 ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN I AM A VERY POOR WOMAN AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT I SET OUT FOR THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN IN ORDER TO SELL MY EGGS IN THE MARKET ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT I LOST MY WAY IN THE DARK
1898-145724-0003 JUST WAIT A MOMENT AND I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING AND SHE DISAPPEARED INTO HER HUT BUT RETURNED VERY SOON AND SAID YOU ARE A MIGHTY PRINCE BUT AT THE SAME
1898-145724-0004 WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
1898-145724-0006 THE KING OF THE EAGLES WILL APPEAR IF YOU RING IT TWICE THE KING OF THE FOXES WILL COME TO YOU AND IF YOU RING IT THREE TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE KING OF THE FISHES BY YOUR SIDE
1898-145724-0007 AND INTENDED SETTING OUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY INTO THE WIDE WORLD IN SEARCH OF THE MAID SO THE NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE MOUNTED HIS FINE HORSE AND LEFT HIS HOME
1898-145724-0009 NO I DO NOT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN
1898-145724-0010 THE PRINCE THANKED HIM FOR HIS INFORMATION AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR ALONG THE SAME ROAD AND AT THE END OF IT CAME TO THE LITTLE HUT WHERE HE FOUND A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0012 WITH DIAMOND WINDOWS HE OPENED THE BIG GATE LEADING INTO THE COURTYARD
1898-145724-0013 WHEN SEVEN DRAGONS RUSHED ON HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED THE PRINCE REPLIED
1898-145724-0015 THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
1898-145724-0016 AND ADDED TO IT ALL SHE HAD THREE HEADS HER APPEARANCE WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO THE PRINCE AND SO WAS HER VOICE WHICH WAS LIKE THE CROAKING OF MANY RAVENS SHE ASKED HIM
1898-145724-0018 WE WILL EAT YOU UP THE PRINCE UNDERTOOK THE TASK AND LED THE MARE OUT TO THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0019 AND AT LAST IN DESPAIR SAT DOWN ON A BIG STONE AND CONTEMPLATED HIS SAD FATE AS HE SAT THUS LOST IN THOUGHT HE NOTICED AN EAGLE FLYING OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HIM OF HIS LITTLE BELL
1898-145724-0021 THE BIRD SAID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE WHO IS GALLOPING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS I WILL SUMMON ALL THE EAGLES OF THE AIR TOGETHER AND ORDER THEM TO CATCH THE MARE AND BRING HER TO YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS THE KING OF THE EAGLES FLEW AWAY
1898-145724-0022 TOWARDS EVENING THE PRINCE HEARD A MIGHTY RUSHING SOUND IN THE AIR AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THOUSANDS OF EAGLES DRIVING THE MARE BEFORE THEM THEY SANK AT HIS FEET ON TO THE GROUND AND GAVE THE MARE OVER TO HIM THEN THE PRINCE RODE HOME TO THE OLD MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0024 SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
1898-145724-0025 HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
1898-145724-0027 AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0028 AFTER THE BALL WE WILL FLY AWAY TOGETHER ON THE THIRD DAY THE PRINCE LED THE MARE TO THE MEADOW AGAIN BUT ONCE MORE SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT THREE TIMES
1898-145724-0030 SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
1898-145724-0031 THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
1898-145724-0033 AND DETERMINED TO LAY SIEGE TO THE FLOWER QUEEN'S PALACE BUT THE QUEEN CAUSED A FOREST OF FLOWERS AS HIGH AS THE SKY TO GROW UP ROUND HER DWELLING THROUGH WHICH NO ONE COULD FORCE A WAY
1898-145724-0034 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN HEARD THAT HER DAUGHTER WANTED TO MARRY THE PRINCE SHE SAID TO HIM I WILL GIVE MY CONSENT TO YOUR MARRIAGE GLADLY BUT MY DAUGHTER CAN ONLY STAY WITH YOU IN SUMMER IN WINTER WHEN EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW
1898-145724-0036 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER DEPARTED AND WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER
1898-145724-0037 AND LASTED TILL THE APPROACH OF WINTER WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER MOTHER
1926-143879-0001 OUR ATTENTION IS ENGAGED AGAIN ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE LATE SPRING TIME SHORTLY AFTER HER RETURN TO PALAZZO CRESCENTINI
1926-143879-0002 TO SOCIAL USES AND THERE WAS THAT IN HER EXPRESSION AND ATTITUDE
1926-143879-0004 TOO TROUBLED FOR ATTENTION SHE MOVED IN A VAIN CIRCLE
1926-143879-0005 SINCE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE WAS NOT THROUGH THE GARDEN IN WHICH STILLNESS AND PRIVACY ALWAYS REIGNED SHE WISHED RATHER TO FORESTALL HIS ARRIVAL BY A PROCESS OF CONJECTURE AND TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE THIS ATTEMPT GAVE HER PLENTY TO DO
1926-143879-0007 A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
1926-143879-0008 IF HER THOUGHTS JUST NOW HAD INCLINED THEMSELVES TO RETROSPECT INSTEAD OF FLUTTERING THEIR WINGS NERVOUSLY ABOUT THE PRESENT
1926-143879-0010 SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND BEHIND HER BUT HAD BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TO WHOM ISABEL NOW PLAYED WITH EQUAL MUNIFICENCE AND TENDERNESS THE PART OF MAIDEN AUNT MISTER LUDLOW
1926-143879-0011 THE LITTLE LUDLOWS HAD NOT YET EVEN FROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW
1926-143879-0013 AND THE SHADE OF GREAT CHESTNUTS MADE A RESTING PLACE FOR SUCH UPWARD WANDERINGS AS MIGHT BE UNDERTAKEN BY LADIES AND CHILDREN ON WARM AFTERNOONS THEY HAD AFTERWARDS REACHED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WHICH WAS WORSHIPPED
1926-143879-0014 AND WITH COSTLY CEREMONIES BY LILY BUT THOUGHT OF AS NOISILY VACANT BY ISABEL WHO IN THESE DAYS MADE
1926-143879-0016 MISSUS LUDLOW'S MENTAL MOTIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS
1926-143879-0017 WHICH HAD AN ELEGANT CONSERVATORY AND WAS JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM HER OWN AT ANOTHER
1926-143879-0019 ISABEL HAD DEVELOPED LESS HOWEVER THAN LILY HAD THOUGHT LIKELY DEVELOPMENT TO LILY'S UNDERSTANDING BEING SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH MORNING CALLS AND EVENING PARTIES INTELLECTUALLY DOUBTLESS SHE HAD MADE IMMENSE STRIDES
1926-143879-0020 THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
1926-143879-0022 THAN THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC TO SAY NOTHING AND DRINKING DEEP IN SECRET OF ROMANCE SHE WAS AS LITTLE DISPOSED TO ASK POOR LILY'S ADVICE AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THAT RARE VOLUME FOREVER
1926-143879-0023 BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF THESE DISCRIMINATIONS AND COULD ONLY PRONOUNCE HER SISTER'S CAREER A STRANGE ANTI CLIMAX AN IMPRESSION CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT ISABEL'S SILENCE ABOUT MISTER OSMOND FOR INSTANCE
1926-143879-0025 IT MADE LILY SO FIDGETY AND SHE ASKED SUCH IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS ISABEL WATCHED THE TRAIN MOVE AWAY SHE KISSED HER HAND TO THE ELDER OF HER SMALL NEPHEWS
1926-143879-0026 THE EARLY DUSK OF A NOVEMBER AFTERNOON HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN THE STREET LAMPS IN THE THICK BROWN AIR LOOKED WEAK AND RED
1926-143879-0028 SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
1926-143879-0029 SHE MADE HER WAY DOWN TO ROME WITHOUT TOUCHING AT FLORENCE
1926-143879-0031 AND HENRIETTA WAS CHEERED ON HER WAY BY A PROMISE FROM MISTER BANTLING THAT HE WOULD SOON COME OVER
1926-143879-0032 HAD NOT BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN ROME BEFORE SHE PROPOSED TO MADAME MERLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE TO THE EAST MADAME MERLE REMARKED THAT HER FRIEND WAS RESTLESS
1926-143879-0034 ISABEL FOUND MUCH TO INTEREST HER IN THESE COUNTRIES THOUGH MADAME MERLE CONTINUED TO REMARK THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST CLASSIC SITES
1926-143879-0035 HER CHARACTER HAD REVEALED ITSELF
1926-143879-0037 SHE CONSIDERED WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH THAT A MORALITY DIFFERING FROM HER OWN MUST BE INFERIOR TO IT
1926-143879-0038 AN OCCASIONAL LAPSE FROM CANDOUR IN THE CONVERSATION OF A PERSON WHO HAD RAISED DELICATE KINDNESS TO AN ART AND WHOSE PRIDE WAS TOO HIGH FOR THE NARROW WAYS OF DECEPTION
1926-143879-0040 ADVANTAGEOUS TO HEAR SHE HAD ONCE OR TWICE HAD A POSITIVE SCARE SINCE IT SO AFFECTED HER TO HAVE TO EXCLAIM OF HER FRIEND
1926-143879-0041 BUT IT STOOD FOR A HIGH WATER MARK IN THE EBB AND FLOW OF CONFIDENCE MADAME MERLE HAD ONCE DECLARED HER BELIEF THAT WHEN A FRIENDSHIP CEASES TO GROW IT IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO DECLINE THERE BEING NO POINT OF EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN LIKING MORE AND LIKING LESS
1926-143879-0043 I DO NOT ALLUDE TO THE IMPULSE IT RECEIVED AS SHE GAZED AT THE PYRAMIDS IN THE COURSE OF AN EXCURSION FROM CAIRO OR AS SHE STOOD AMONG THE BROKEN COLUMNS OF THE ACROPOLIS AND FIXED HER EYES UPON THE POINT DESIGNATED TO HER AS THE STRAIT OF SALAMIS
1926-143879-0044 DEEP AND MEMORABLE AS THESE EMOTIONS HAD REMAINED SHE CAME BACK BY THE LAST OF MARCH FROM EGYPT AND GREECE AND MADE ANOTHER STAY IN ROME A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL
1926-143879-0046 AND WENT TO PAY A VISIT AT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI MADAME MERLE ON THIS OCCASION REMAINING IN ROME
1926-147979-0000 WINTER LIES TOO LONG IN COUNTRY TOWNS HANGS ON UNTIL IT IS STALE AND SHABBY OLD AND SULLEN ON THE FARM THE WEATHER WAS THE GREAT FACT AND MEN'S AFFAIRS WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT AS THE STREAMS CREEP UNDER THE ICE
1926-147979-0002 THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I WENT TO THE RIVER WITH THE HARLINGS ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND WE SKATED UP TO THE BIG ISLAND AND MADE BONFIRES ON THE FROZEN SAND BUT BY MARCH THE ICE WAS ROUGH AND CHOPPY
1926-147979-0003 AT OUR COMFORTABLE HOTEL MISSUS HARLING HAD KNOWN D'ARNAULT FOR YEARS
1926-147979-0005 FOR MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA FOR A WEEK JOHNNIE HAD BEEN HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUESTS UNTIL HE WAS RATHER ABSENT MINDED IT WAS MISSUS GARDENER WHO RAN THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED AFTER EVERYTHING HER HUSBAND STOOD AT THE DESK AND WELCOMED INCOMING TRAVELERS
1926-147979-0006 HE WAS A POPULAR FELLOW BUT NO MANAGER MISSUS GARDENER WAS ADMITTEDLY THE BEST DRESSED WOMAN IN BLACK HAWK DROVE THE BEST HORSE AND HAD A SMART TRAP AND A LITTLE WHITE AND GOLD SLEIGH
1926-147979-0008 GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
1926-147979-0009 TWO CLASSES THOSE WHO HAD SEEN MISSUS GARDENER'S DIAMONDS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT WHEN I STOLE INTO THE PARLOR ANSON KIRKPATRICK MARSHALL FIELD'S MAN
1926-147979-0011 A DRUG MAN AND WILLY O'REILLY WHO TRAVELED FOR A JEWELRY HOUSE AND SOLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TALK WAS ALL ABOUT GOOD AND BAD HOTELS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND MUSICAL PRODIGIES I LEARNED THAT MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA TO HEAR BOOTH AND BARRETT
1926-147979-0012 WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
1926-147979-0014 WE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC SOME OF YOU GENTLEMEN GOING TO PLAY FOR ME THIS EVENING IT WAS THE SOFT AMIABLE NEGRO VOICE LIKE THOSE I REMEMBERED FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH THE NOTE OF DOCILE SUBSERVIENCE IN IT
1926-147979-0015 HE HAD THE NEGRO HEAD TOO ALMOST NO HEAD AT ALL NOTHING BEHIND THE EARS BUT FOLDS OF NECK UNDER CLOSE CLIPPED WOOL
1926-147979-0017 NOW GENTLEMEN I EXPECT YOU'VE ALL GOT GRAND VOICES SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD OLD PLANTATION SONGS TO NIGHT THE MEN GATHERED ROUND HIM AS HE BEGAN TO PLAY MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME THEY SANG ONE NEGRO MELODY AFTER ANOTHER
1926-147979-0018 WHILE THE MULATTO SAT ROCKING HIMSELF HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS YELLOW FACE LIFTED ITS SHRIVELED EYELIDS NEVER FLUTTERING HE WAS BORN IN THE FAR SOUTH ON THE D'ARNAULT PLANTATION WHERE THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE FACT OF SLAVERY PERSISTED
1926-147979-0020 HIS MOTHER A BUXOM YOUNG NEGRO WENCH WHO WAS LAUNDRESS FOR THE D'ARNAULTS CONCLUDED THAT HER BLIND BABY WAS NOT RIGHT IN HIS HEAD AND SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HIM SHE LOVED HIM DEVOTEDLY BUT HE WAS SO UGLY WITH HIS SUNKEN EYES AND HIS FIDGETS
1926-147979-0021 THAT SHE HID HIM AWAY FROM PEOPLE ALL THE DAINTIES SHE BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE BIG HOUSE WERE FOR THE BLIND CHILD AND SHE BEAT AND CUFFED HER OTHER CHILDREN WHENEVER SHE FOUND THEM TEASING HIM OR TRYING TO GET HIS CHICKEN BONE AWAY FROM HIM HE BEGAN TO TALK EARLY
1926-147979-0023 HE WAS DOCILE AND OBEDIENT BUT WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS TAKING THE SAME DIRECTION HE FELT HIS WAY THROUGH THE LILACS ALONG THE BOXWOOD HEDGE
1926-147979-0024 WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIM SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE CABIN SHE WHIPPED HIM UNMERCIFULLY AND TOLD HIM WHAT DREADFUL THINGS OLD MISTER D'ARNAULT WOULD DO TO HIM IF HE EVER FOUND HIM NEAR THE BIG HOUSE BUT THE NEXT TIME SAMSON HAD A CHANCE HE RAN AWAY AGAIN
1926-147979-0026 THOUGH IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHER CHILDREN ONE DAY SAMSON WAS STANDING THUS WHILE MISS NELLIE WAS PLAYING HER LESSON TO HER MUSIC MASTER THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN
1926-147979-0027 TALK A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN LEAVE THE ROOM HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AFTER THEM HE CREPT UP TO THE FRONT WINDOWS AND STUCK HIS HEAD IN THERE WAS NO ONE THERE HE COULD ALWAYS DETECT THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE IN A ROOM
1926-147979-0029 HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT HE PULLED IN HIS OTHER FOOT THROUGH THE DARK HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE THING TO ITS MOUTH HE TOUCHED IT SOFTLY AND IT ANSWERED SOFTLY KINDLY HE SHIVERED AND STOOD STILL
1926-147979-0030 THEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL IT ALL OVER RAN HIS FINGER TIPS ALONG THE SLIPPERY SIDES EMBRACED THE CARVED LEGS TRIED TO GET SOME CONCEPTION OF ITS SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE SPACE IT OCCUPIED IN PRIMEVAL NIGHT
1926-147979-0032 HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
1926-147979-0033 THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
1926-147979-0035 LEAPED FORWARD IN THE DARK STRUCK HIS HEAD ON THE OPEN WINDOW AND FELL SCREAMING AND BLEEDING TO THE FLOOR HE HAD WHAT HIS MOTHER CALLED A FIT THE DOCTOR CAME AND GAVE HIM OPIUM WHEN SAMSON WAS WELL AGAIN HIS YOUNG MISTRESS LED HIM BACK TO THE PIANO
1926-147979-0036 SEVERAL TEACHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH HIM THEY FOUND HE HAD ABSOLUTE PITCH AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD HE COULD REPEAT AFTER A FASHION ANY COMPOSITION THAT WAS PLAYED FOR HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WRONG NOTES HE STRUCK HE NEVER LOST THE INTENTION OF A PASSAGE
1926-147979-0038 AND HE WERE GLOATING OVER THEM AND TRICKLING THEM THROUGH HIS YELLOW FINGERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRASHING WALTZ D'ARNAULT SUDDENLY BEGAN TO PLAY SOFTLY AND TURNING TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND HIM WHISPERED

1926-147987-0000 THE DAY AFTER THE CUTTERS LEFT ANTONIA CAME OVER TO SEE US GRANDMOTHER NOTICED THAT SHE SEEMED TROUBLED AND DISTRACTED YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND ANTONIA SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
1926-147987-0002 AS HE HAD JUST PUT A NEW YALE LOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR CUTTER HAD BEEN SO INSISTENT IN REGARD TO THESE DETAILS THAT NOW SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT STAYING THERE ALONE
1926-147987-0003 OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
1926-147987-0005 MAYBE JIM WOULD BE WILLING TO GO OVER THERE AND SLEEP AND YOU COULD COME HERE NIGHTS I'D FEEL SAFER KNOWING YOU WERE UNDER MY OWN ROOF I GUESS JIM COULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR SILVER AND OLD USURY NOTES AS WELL AS YOU COULD
1926-147987-0006 ANTONIA TURNED TO ME EAGERLY OH WOULD YOU JIM
1926-147987-0008 I WAS ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT I DECIDED THAT HE MIGHT TAKE THE CUTTERS SILVER WHOEVER HE WAS
1926-147987-0009 I HELD MY BREATH AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL A HAND CLOSED SOFTLY ON MY SHOULDER AND AT THE SAME MOMENT I FELT SOMETHING HAIRY AND COLOGNE SCENTED BRUSHING MY FACE
1926-147987-0011 WHERE IS SHE UNDER THE BED ARE YOU HUSSY I KNOW YOUR TRICKS WAIT TILL I GET AT YOU I'LL FIX THIS RAT YOU'VE GOT IN HERE HE'S CAUGHT ALL RIGHT SO LONG AS CUTTER HAD ME BY THE THROAT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR ME AT ALL
1926-147987-0012 WHEN I GOT HOME I CLIMBED IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW I WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM MY NOSE AND LIP BUT I WAS TOO SICK TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I FOUND A SHAWL AND AN OVERCOAT ON THE HATRACK LAY DOWN ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND IN SPITE OF MY HURTS WENT TO SLEEP
1926-147987-0014 AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
1926-147987-0015 SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH I WAS TOO FAINT AND MISERABLE TO GO INTO EXPLANATIONS WHEN SHE TOOK
1926-147987-0017 SHE HAD LET ME IN FOR ALL THIS DISGUSTINGNESS GRANDMOTHER KEPT SAYING HOW THANKFUL WE OUGHT TO BE THAT I HAD BEEN THERE INSTEAD OF ANTONIA BUT I LAY WITH MY DISFIGURED FACE TO THE WALL AND FELT NO PARTICULAR GRATITUDE
1926-147987-0018 IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
1926-147987-0020 MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
1926-147987-0021 THERE STOOD MISSUS CUTTER LOCKED OUT FOR SHE HAD NO KEY TO THE NEW LOCK HER HEAD TREMBLING WITH RAGE I ADVISED HER TO CONTROL HERSELF OR SHE WOULD HAVE A STROKE GRANDMOTHER SAID AFTERWARDS
1926-147987-0023 SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD STARTED HOME FROM OMAHA TOGETHER THE MORNING BEFORE THEY HAD TO STOP OVER SEVERAL HOURS AT WAYMORE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN
1926-147987-0024 WHEN HE RETURNED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT THERE
1926-147987-0026 MISTER CUTTER SHOWED HIS WIFE'S TICKET TO THE CONDUCTOR AND SETTLED HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE THE TRAIN MOVED OFF
1926-147987-0027 AND THAT CUTTER MUST HAVE PLANNED IT SO THE CONDUCTOR TOLD HER THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN WAS DUE AT WAYMORE TWELVE MINUTES AFTER THE KANSAS CITY TRAIN LEFT SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLAYED THIS TRICK IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO BLACK HAWK WITHOUT HER
1926-147987-0029 BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS PART OF HIS FUN TO OUTRAGE HER FEELINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MISTER CUTTER WILL PAY FOR THIS MISSUS BURDEN HE WILL PAY MISSUS CUTTER AVOUCHED NODDING HER HORSELIKE HEAD AND ROLLING HER EYES
1926-147987-0030 CERTAINLY CUTTER LIKED TO HAVE HIS WIFE THINK HIM A DEVIL IN SOME WAY HE DEPENDED UPON THE EXCITEMENT HE COULD AROUSE IN HER HYSTERICAL NATURE PERHAPS HE GOT THE FEELING OF BEING A RAKE MORE FROM HIS WIFE'S RAGE AND AMAZEMENT
1963-142393-0000 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0001 I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
1963-142393-0003 I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
1963-142393-0004 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0006 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0007 WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
1963-142393-0009 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0012 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0013 THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
1963-142393-0015 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0016 THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST THAT IS A BASE
1963-142393-0018 ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
1963-142393-0019 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0021 WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
1963-142393-0022 BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0025 THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
1963-142393-0027 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
1963-142393-0028 FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
1963-142393-0030 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
1963-142393-0031 WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT
1963-142393-0033 OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
1963-142393-0034 THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
1963-142393-0036 HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0039 SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
1963-142393-0040 HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
1963-142393-0042 PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
1963-142393-0043 AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1963-142393-0045 SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
1963-142393-0046 COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
1963-142393-0048 LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
1963-142393-0049 PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
1963-142393-0052 SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
1963-142393-0054 WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-142393-0057 TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER

1970-10594-0028 MY DARLING IS HAPPY WITH MISSUS CAREW TOO HAPPY
1970-10594-0030 I MADE HASTE TO SAY LISTEN TO MY LITTLE STORY IT WILL NOT ADD TO YOUR PAIN RATHER ALLEVIATE IT
1970-10594-0031 I ALSO KNEW THAT THIS PATIENT HAD OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL AS I FOR IMPERVIOUS AS THE DOOR LOOKED I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE DOCTOR'S MUTTERINGS WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS SAFE BEYOND EAR SHOT IF NOT ASLEEP
1970-10594-0033 AT ANOTHER TIME SHE MIGHT HAVE RESENTED THESE WORDS ESPECIALLY THE LAST BUT I HAD ROUSED HER CURIOSITY HER PANTING EAGER CURIOSITY AND SHE LET THEM PASS ALTOGETHER UNCHALLENGED DID YOU SEE THIS WOMAN
1970-10594-0034 WAS SHE OF COMMON BLOOD COMMON MANNERS IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE GWENDOLEN IS BY NATURE SO DAINTY IN ALL HER WAYS THE WOMAN WAS A LADY I DID NOT SEE HER FACE IT WAS HEAVILY VEILED
1970-10594-0036 A STRING OF BEADS WHICH WERE BOTH VALUABLE AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP I KNOW BECAUSE IT BROKE JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING AND THE BEADS FELL ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND ONE ROLLED MY WAY AND I PICKED IT UP SCAMP THAT I WAS
1970-10594-0037 WHEN BOTH THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE OTHERS A BEAD A COSTLY BEAD AND YOU WERE NOT FOUND OUT NO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH SHE NEVER SEEMED TO MISS IT
1970-10594-0039 TILL YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HER GREAT EYES HAGGARD WITH SUFFERING ROSE TO MINE THEN THEY FELL ON THE BEAD WHICH I HAD TAKEN FROM MY POCKET THE CRY SHE GAVE WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT EFFECTUALLY SETTLED ALL MY DOUBTS
1970-10594-0040 I ASKED IMPRESSIVELY FOR MINUTES SHE DID NOT ANSWER SHE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF HER MOTHER SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST HER MOTHER HER OWN MOTHER
1970-10594-0042 FEELING MY POSITION KEENLY I WALKED TO THE WINDOW BUT SOON TURNED AND CAME BACK IN RESPONSE TO HER CRY I MUST SEE MISSUS CAREW INSTANTLY
1970-10594-0043 THEY WILL THINK I HAVE GONE TO BE ON HAND TO MEET MISTER OCUMPAUGH AND WILL SAY THAT I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH OVERRIDE THEIR OBJECTIONS I PUT MY WHOLE CAUSE IN YOUR HANDS YOU WILL GO WITH ME
1970-26100-0000 HER WILLINGNESS TO BREAK OUR FRIENDSHIP AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY GAVE ME LITTLE ROOM TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT SHE SHOULD RISK HER REPUTATION TO RUN AFTER THAT MAN WAS INEXPLICABLE BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A WOMAN
1970-26100-0001 IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
1970-26100-0003 NOW AND AGAIN I WOULD BE RECALLED FROM MY GLOOM BY SOME QUESTION FROM THE CORONER HE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHO MURDERED JIM
1970-26100-0004 AS WE NEARED THE BRIDGE I NOTICED AGAIN HOW SCANT THE VEGETATION WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD ANY ONE WISHING TO MURDER JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM COMING
1970-26100-0006 AS HE SAW IT THE CORONER GAVE A GRUNT OF SATISFACTION THERE'S OUR TREE WE STOPPED THE CAR AND SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE THORNY BUSHES THAT LINED THE ROAD THE GROUND WAS HARD CLAY WITH ONLY BURDOCK AND WEEDS GROWING ON IT
1970-26100-0007 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WHEN WE REACHED THE TREE THE CORONER EXAMINED THE GROUND AROUND IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE AROSE HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND HERE I ASKED
1970-26100-0009 STILL THE FACT THAT THE TREE IS WHERE IT IS MAKES THE THEORY PLAUSIBLE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE ROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES
1970-26100-0010 THOSE BULLET HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WERE FIRED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND THE MACHINE THEY SLANTED DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWISE
1970-26100-0012 I'M SORRY FOR WHEN I SAW THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE'D STRUCK THE RIGHT TRACK THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T MAKE OUT I STATED AND THAT IS THE STRANGE CRY OF MY SISTER IN HER DELIRIUM LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US SHE CALLED OUT
1970-26100-0013 AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SWEAR IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE CORONER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN TURNED TO ME WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO REFER TO THE ACCIDENT ALL THE REST WAS APPARENTLY DELIRIUM
1970-26100-0015 EVERYTHING POINTS TO AN AEROPLANE IT WAS DONE A HUNDRED YES A THOUSAND TIMES IN THE WAR WHILE I WAS OVER THERE WITH MY HOSPITAL UNIT WE USED TO GET A LOT OF CASES OF MOTORCYCLE DESPATCH RIDERS WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF BY GERMAN AVIATORS
1970-26100-0016 AND IS THE HEAD OF AN AEROPLANE FIRM BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN AEROPLANE HERE HE COULD GET ONE EASY ENOUGH THE CLEVER DEVIL LOOK OVER THERE HE HAD THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE GOLF COURSE AS A PERFECT LANDING GROUND
1970-26100-0018 LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US YES BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE IT I ASKED THAT'S UP TO US NOW AN AEROPLANE HAS SUCH SPEED THAT IT WAS EASY FOR WOODS TO FASHION AN INGENIOUS ALIBI
1970-26100-0019 TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF HIS TIME ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER BUT THERE MUST BE SOME HOLES IN IT THERE ALWAYS IS IN A MANUFACTURED ALIBI I WANT YOU TO GO OVER TO THE COUNTRY CLUB AND CHECK UP MISTER WOODS SCHEDULE OF THAT NIGHT

1970-26100-0031 GROGAN DO YOU REMEMBER WHO WAS IN THE BAR BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND EIGHT THIRTY ON THE NIGHT OF THE FELDERSON MURDER ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE GENTLEMEN SIR THERE WAS MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN AND I THINK MISTER WOODS
1970-26100-0033 WAS BECAUSE HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT A FEW NIGHTS AFTER THE MURDER THERE WERE A FEW GENTLEMEN IN HERE AND THEY WERE TALKING OF MISTER FELDERSON'S DEATH MISTER WOODS SAID IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE MURDERER HADN'T BEEN FOUND
1970-26100-0034 ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
1970-26100-0036 PARALLELING EACH OTHER FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YARDS
1970-28415-0000 THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
1970-28415-0006 SOME CUT BRANCHES FROM THE TREES AND WAVED THEM BEFORE THE MESSIAH IT WAS A ROYAL WELCOME ONLY THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS AND THE PHARISEES WERE SORRY TO SEE JESUS COME WHAT IS THERE WE CAN DO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
1970-28415-0008 THIS WAS HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HIS HOUSE THESE WERE HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE AND HIS PEOPLE THE KING FOR WHOM THE JEWS HAD BEEN WAITING HAD COME AT LAST TO REIGN
1970-28415-0009 THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
1970-28415-0011 WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
1970-28415-0012 BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAID
1970-28415-0014 BUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT
1970-28415-0015 THEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACH
1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
1970-28415-0020 DO WHATEVER YOUR DUTY IS TO CAESAR AND HIS GOVERNMENT YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES AND ALSO DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER ANSWER THAT NO ONE HAD A WORD TO SAY
1970-28415-0021 WATCH OUT FOR THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES HE TOLD THE PEOPLE AND DON'T BE LIKE THEM THEY LOVE TO WALK AROUND IN THEIR LONG WHITE ROBES AND TO HAVE EVERYBODY BOW TO THEM IN THE STREET AND TO SIT IN THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND AT DINNERS
1970-28415-0023 WHERE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THEIR GIFTS TO GOD
1970-28415-0024 THEN CAME A POOR WIDOW WHO PUT TWO SMALL COINS INTO THE BOX JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE GIVING
1970-28415-0026 AND THIS WAS THE LAST STORY HE EVER TOLD SOMEDAY I SHALL SIT UPON MY THRONE AND JUDGE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH TO SOME PEOPLE I WILL SAY COME MY HEAVENLY FATHER LOVES YOU
1970-28415-0027 TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
1970-28415-0029 THEN I WILL SAY TO OTHERS GO AWAY GOD WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND NAKED AND SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU DID NOTHING AT ALL FOR ME
1970-28415-0030 THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
1970-28415-0032 IF HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN JERUSALEM PRETENDING TO BE KING OF THE JEWS THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS WANTED TO KILL JESUS THAT WAS ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
1970-28415-0033 FOR WHENEVER JESUS CAME TO JERUSALEM GREAT CROWDS GATHERED AROUND HIM NONE OF THE PRIESTS DARED TO LAY A FINGER ON HIM IN THE OPEN THE CROWDS WOULD NEVER LET THEM IT SEEMED TO THE PEOPLE AS IF THE MESSIAH MIGHT HAVE COME AT LAST
1970-28415-0035 WE SHALL HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH JESUS QUIETLY SOMEONE SAID YES THE OTHERS AGREED WE CAN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY OF THE PASSOVER IF WE SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO HIM ON THAT DAY THERE WOULD BE A RIOT
1970-28415-0036 THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF JESUS THE CRAFTIEST MEN IN JERUSALEM COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR IT WAS ONE OF JESUS TWELVE DISCIPLES
1970-28415-0038 SO FOR THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER JUDAS AGREED TO SHOW THEM WHERE JESUS WAS AT SOME TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND BUT THE TWELVE DISCIPLES SEND SOLDIERS WHEN I TELL YOU JUDAS SAID
1970-28415-0039 THE OTHER DISCIPLES WILL ALL BE THERE AND THE SOLDIERS WON'T KNOW WHICH MAN TO TAKE BUT I WILL GO UP TO JESUS AND KISS HIM THE MAN I KISS WILL BE THE ONE YOU WANT
1992-141719-0001 BABYLON AT THAT TIME SEEM'D TO BE PERFECTLY SERENE AND QUIET AS FOR THE YOUNG PRINCE OF HYRCANIA HE WAS SLAIN IN BATTLE THE BABYLONIANS WHO WERE THE VICTORS
1992-141719-0002 WHO SHOULD GAIN IT BY A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL ELECTION THEY WERE DETERMIN'D THAT THE MOST VALUABLE POST OF HONOUR IN THE WORLD NAMELY
1992-141719-0004 THAT HE WHO SHOULD DISTINGUISH HIMSELF BY HIS SUPERIOR VALOUR AND WISDOM SHOULD UNANIMOUSLY BE ACKNOWLEDG'D THE SOVEREIGN ELECT A SPACIOUS LIST OR CIRCUS WAS PITCHED UPON SURROUNDED WITH COMMODIOUS SEATS
1992-141719-0005 ERECTED IN AN AMPHITHEATRICAL MANNER AND RICHLY EMBELLISH'D SOME FEW LEAGUES FROM THE CITY THITHER THE COMBATANTS OR CHAMPIONS WERE TO REPAIR COMPLEATLY ACCOUTRED EACH OF THEM HAD A DISTINCT APARTMENT TO HIMSELF BEHIND THE LISTS
1992-141719-0007 IN ORDER THAT HE WHO SHOULD REMAIN MASTER OF THE FIELD SHOULD BE PROCLAIM'D THE HAPPY VICTOR FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY WERE TO MEET AGAIN ACCOUTRED AS BEFORE
1992-141719-0008 AND TO EXPLAIN ALL SUCH A ENIGMAS OR RIDDLES AS THE MAGI SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PROPOSE IF THEIR QUERIES SHOULD PROVE TOO INTRICATE AND PERPLEXT FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THEY WERE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LISTS AGAIN AND AFTER THAT TO FRESH A ENIGMAS
1992-141719-0010 THE QUEEN IN THE MEAN TIME WAS TO BE NARROWLY WATCH'D AND ALLOW'D ONLY TO BE A SPECTATOR OF BOTH THEIR AMUSEMENTS AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND MOREOVER TO BE COVER'D WITH A VAIL
1992-141719-0011 NOR WAS SHE INDULG'D SO FAR AS TO SPEAK ONE SINGLE WORD TO ANY CANDIDATE WHOMSOEVER IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LEAST JEALOUSY OR SUSPICION EITHER OF PARTIALITY OR INJUSTICE
1992-141719-0013 NOT ONLY TO FORTIFY HIS COURAGE BUT TO ILLUMINATE HIS MIND WITH WISDOM ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION THE NIGHT BEFORE THESE MARTIAL ATCHIEVEMENTS WERE TO COMMENCE ZADIG ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES
1992-141719-0014 HE INSCRIB'D HIS DEVICE AMONGST THE LIST OF COMBATANTS CONCEALING AT THE SAME TIME BOTH HIS PERSON AND NAME AS THE LAWS OF THE ELECTION REQUIRED AND ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW TO THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
1992-141719-0016 SHE SENT HIM LIKEWISE ONE OF THE FINEST HORSES IN ALL PERSIA
1992-141719-0017 WHICH REDOUBLED HIS VIGOUR AND HIS HOPES THE NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN BEING SEATED UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE ENRICH'D WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND THE AMPHITHEATRES BEING CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ALL RANKS AND CONDITIONS FROM BABYLON
1992-141719-0019 ONE ITABOD BY NAME IMMENSELY RICH INDEED AND VERY HAUGHTY
1992-141719-0020 EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD AND A MAN OF NO ACQUIR'D PARTS THE SYCOPHANTS THAT HOVER'D ROUND ABOUT HIM FLATTER'D HIM THAT A MAN OF HIS MERIT COULDN'T FAIL OF BEING KING HE IMPERIOUSLY REPLIED ONE OF MY MERIT MUST BE KING
1992-141719-0022 BY ITOBAD'S MANNER OF MANAGING HIS HORSE THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHOM HEAV'N HAD PITCH'D UPON TO SWAY THE BABYLONISH SCEPTER THE FIRST COMBATANT THAT TILTED WITH HIM THREW HIM OUT OF THE SADDLE THE SECOND FLUNG HIM QUITE OVER THE CRUPPER
1992-141719-0023 AND LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEELS QUIV'RING IN THE AIR ITOBAD TIS TRUE REMOUNTED BUT WITH SO ILL A GRACE
1992-141719-0025 AND WITH A SNEER REMOUNTED HIM THE FOURTH COMBATANT CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS LEFT LEG AND UNHORS'D HIM AGAIN HE WAS CONVEY'D THRO THE HISSING MULTITUDE TO HIS LODGE WHERE ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN THAT CASE PROVIDED HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT
1992-141719-0026 AND AS HE HOBBLED ALONG SAID HE TO THE ESQUIRES WHAT A SAD MISFORTUNE IS THIS TO ONE OF MY BIRTH AND CHARACTER THE OTHER CHAMPIONS PLAY'D THEIR PARTS MUCH BETTER AND ALL CAME OFF WITH CREDIT
1992-141719-0028 ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND WITH SUCH AN AIR AND GRACE AS GAIN'D HIM UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AS THE CASE STOOD THUS ZADIG AND HOTTAM WERE TO CLOSE THE DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT IN A SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0029 THE ARMOUR OF THE LATTER WAS OF A BLUE COLOUR MIXT WITH GOLD AND THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE OF THE SAME THOSE OF THE FORMER WHITE AS SNOW THE MULTITUDE WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR WISHES THE KNIGHT IN BLUE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF SOME OF THE LADIES
1992-141719-0031 AND KEEPING FIRM IN THEIR SADDLES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH REBUFFS WITH THEIR LANCES THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS THE QUEEN ONLY EXCEPTED WISH'D FOR TWO KINGS OF BABYLON AT LAST THEIR HORSES BEING TIRED AND BOTH THEIR LANCES BROKE
1992-141719-0032 ZADIG MADE USE OF THE FOLLOWING STRATAGEM
1992-141719-0034 WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CRIED OUT VICTORY VICTORY IN FAVOUR OF THE CHAMPION IN WHITE
1992-141719-0035 INCENS'D TO THE LAST DEGREE GOT UP AND DREW HIS SWORD ZADIG SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WITH HIS SABRE IN HIS HAND NOW BEHOLD THE TWO CHIEFTAINS UPON THEIR LEGS COMMENCING A NEW TRIAL OF SKILL WHERE THEY SEEM'D TO GET THE BETTER OF EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY
1992-141719-0037 AT OTHER TIMES THEY PUSH'D AS OCCASION OFFER'D NOW ON THE RIGHT THEN ON THE LEFT NOW ON THE HEAD THEN AT THE BREAST THEY RETREATED THEY ADVANC'D THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE THEY CLOS'D AGAIN
1992-141719-0038 THEIR SWORDS STRUCK FIRE ALMOST AT EVERY BLOW AT LAST ZADIG IN ORDER TO RECOVER HIS BREATH FOR A MOMENT OR TWO STOOD STILL AND AFTERWARDS MAKING A FEINT AT THE PRINCE THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AND DISARM'D HIM HOTTAM THEREUPON
1992-141719-0040 SEVERAL MUTES WERE ORDER'D TO WAIT ON THE CHAMPIONS AND CARRY THEM SOME PROPER REFRESHMENT WE'LL LEAVE THE READER TO JUDGE WHETHER THE QUEEN'S DWARF WAS NOT APPOINTED TO WAIT ON ZADIG ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION AFTER SUPPER THE MUTES WITHDREW
1992-141719-0041 AND LEFT THE COMBATANTS TO REST THEIR WEARIED LIMBS TILL THE NEXT MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE VICTOR WAS TO PRODUCE HIS DEVICE BEFORE THE GRAND MAGUS IN ORDER TO CONFER NOTES AND DISCOVER THE HERO WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE ZADIG SLEPT VERY SOUND
1992-141719-0043 TOOK HIS WHITE ARMOUR AND DEVICE AWAY WITH HIM AND SUBSTITUTED HIS GREEN ONE IN ITS PLACE AS SOON AS THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN HE REPAIR'D WITH A SEEMINGLY UNDAUNTED COURAGE TO THE GRAND MAGUS TO INFORM HIM THAT HE WAS THE MIGHTY HERO THE HAPPY VICTOR
1992-141719-0044 AND WAS PROCLAIM'D VICTOR BEFORE ZADIG WAS AWAKE
1992-141719-0046 HE WAS OBLIG'D THO SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL TO PUT IT ON HAVING NOTHING ELSE IN HIS LODGE TO APPEAR IN CONFOUNDED AND BIG WITH RESENTMENT
1992-141719-0047 THE POPULACE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND IN THE CIRCUS HISS'D HIM EVERY STEP HE TOOK THEY MADE A RING ABOUT HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF IGNOMINY AND CONTEMPT THE MOST COWARDLY WRETCH BREATHING WAS NEVER SURE SO SWEATED OR HUNTED DOWN AS POOR ZADIG
1992-141719-0049 HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
1992-141719-0050 SO ON THE OTHER HE WAS ALMOST DROVE DISTRACTED WITH VEXATION AND RESENTMENT HE WITHDREW THEREFORE IN A SOLITARY MOOD TO THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES NOW FULLY PERSUADED
1992-141719-0052 DOWN TO HIS LATE LOSS OF HIS WHITE ARMOUR SEE SAID HE THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE OF BEING A SLUGGARD
1992-141719-0053 ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS OR MANKIND ALL THE PERSONAL VALOUR THAT I CAN BOAST OF HAS ONLY PROV'D AN AGGRAVATION OF MY SORROWS HE CARRIED THE POINT SO FAR AT LAST AS TO MURMUR AT THE UNEQUAL DISPENSATIONS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE
1992-141719-0055 HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
2002-139469-0096 OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
2002-139469-0114 MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
2007-132570-0000 WHAT WERE THEY DISPUTING THEN SAID EMILY NO MA'AMSELLE NOR FIGHTING BUT ALMOST AS GOOD FOR I BELIEVE THERE WAS NOT ONE OF THE SIGNORS SOBER
2007-132570-0001 AND WHAT IS MORE NOT ONE OF THOSE FINE LADIES SOBER EITHER I THOUGHT WHEN I SAW THEM FIRST THAT ALL THOSE FINE SILKS AND FINE VEILS WHY MA'AMSELLE THEIR VEILS WERE WORKED WITH SILVER
2007-132570-0003 IF YOU ARE TO GO RUNNING ABOUT THE CASTLE AMONG ALL THESE DRUNKEN SIGNORS
2007-132570-0004 AND ACROSS THE GREAT HALL AND UP THE MARBLE STAIR CASE AND ALONG THE NORTH GALLERY AND THROUGH THE WEST WING OF THE CASTLE AND I AM IN THE CORRIDOR IN A MINUTE ARE YOU SO SAYS HE AND WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU IF YOU MEET ANY OF THOSE NOBLE CAVALIERS IN THE WAY
2007-132570-0006 NO NO SAYS HE I WILL CUT THE WAY SHORTER THAN THROUGH THE VAULTED PASSAGE AND UP THE MARBLE STAIR CASE AND ALONG THE NORTH GALLERY AND THROUGH THE WEST WING OF THE CASTLE FOR YOU SHALL STAY HERE ANNETTE YOU SHALL NOT GO OUT OF THIS ROOM TO NIGHT SO
2007-132570-0007 WELL WELL SAID EMILY IMPATIENTLY AND ANXIOUS TO ENQUIRE ON ANOTHER SUBJECT
2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S

2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE

2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE

2007-149877-0060 SAY SHE WAS A LITTLE DANDY I TELL YOU
2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
2136-5140-0000 AS ALREADY DETAILED THAT I WAS ONE NIGHT SITTING AT THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WINDOW LOST IN THE MELANCHOLY REVERIES OF NIGHT AND IN ADMIRATION OF THE MOONLIGHTED SCENE I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM
2136-5140-0002 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0005 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY
2136-5140-0006 AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW
2136-5140-0008 HE LED ME INTO THE GARDEN THE DUTCH GARDEN WE USED TO CALL IT WITH A BALUSTRADE AND STATUES AT THE FARTHER FRONT LAID OUT IN A CARPET PATTERN OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED FLOWERS WE CAME DOWN THE BROAD FLIGHT OF CAEN STONE STEPS INTO THIS
2136-5140-0009 AND WE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE BALUSTRADE THE BASE WAS TOO HIGH AT THE SPOT WHERE WE REACHED IT FOR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HOLDING MY HAND HE SAID
2136-5140-0011 GROWING BY THE WALLS AND WINDOWS AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AMONG THE STEMS OF THE TREES AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY THERE AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHALL BE UNDER THOSE TREES OURSELVES AND TALKING TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN
2136-5140-0012 YET NOW TO ME IT IS BUT A PICTURE IN MY BRAIN AND TO YOU BUT A STORY TOLD BY ME WHICH YOU BELIEVE COME DEAR LET US BE GOING SO WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AT THE RIGHT
2136-5140-0014 THE SAME ON WHICH I WAS NOW LOOKING IN THE DISTANCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE MADE ME SIT DOWN TO REST
2136-5140-0015 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0017 WE CAME TO ME QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DEEP SYLVAN SHADOWS UPON THE GREY PILLARED TEMPLE FOUR FRONTED WITH A SLANTING PEDESTAL OF LICHEN STAINED STEPS
2136-5140-0018 THE LONELY SEPULCHRE IN WHICH I HAD THE MORNING BEFORE SEEN POOR MAMMA LAID AT THE SIGHT THE FOUNTAINS OF MY GRIEF REOPENED AND I CRIED BITTERLY REPEATING OH MAMMA MAMMA LITTLE MAMMA
2136-5140-0020 NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING HORIZONTALLY WITH HIS STICK TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE OPPOSITE STRUCTURE OH THAT THAT PLACE WHERE POOR MAMMA IS
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
2136-5140-0023 AND HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT CONCERNS US TO KNOW HE SAYS YOUR MAMMA IS NOT THERE SHE IS TAKEN AWAY I CRIED STARTING UP AND WITH STREAMING EYES GAZING ON THE BUILDING WHICH THOUGH I STAMPED MY FEET IN MY DISTRACTION
2136-5140-0024 I WAS AFRAID TO APPROACH OH IS MAMMA TAKEN AWAY WHERE IS SHE WHERE HAVE THEY BROUGHT HER TO I WAS UTTERING UNCONSCIOUSLY VERY NEARLY THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MARY
2136-5140-0026 AND TELLS ME ALL HE SEES JUST AS I TOLD YOU IN THE GARDEN ABOUT THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE COTTAGE AND THE TREES AND FLOWERS WHICH YOU COULD NOT SEE
2136-5140-0027 SO I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS I DID THEN AND AS WE ARE BOTH I HOPE WALKING ON TO THE SAME PLACE JUST AS WE DID TO THE TREES AND COTTAGE
2136-5140-0029 AND OF SHADOWS WHERE THE DEAD WERE VISIBLE HE LEANED HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE AND HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND WHICH SHADED HIS DOWNCAST EYES IN THAT ATTITUDE HE DESCRIBED TO ME A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE
2136-5140-0030 RADIANT WITH A WONDROUS LIGHT IN WHICH REJOICING MY MOTHER MOVED ALONG AN AIRY PATH ASCENDING AMONG MOUNTAINS OF FANTASTIC HEIGHT AND PEAKS MELTING IN CELESTIAL COLOURING INTO THE AIR
2136-5140-0032 WE CANNOT WALK TO THE PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED WE CAN ONLY REACH IT THROUGH THE GATE OF DEATH TO WHICH WE ARE ALL TENDING YOUNG AND OLD WITH SURE STEPS AND WHERE IS THE GATE OF DEATH I ASKED IN A SORT OF WHISPER AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
2136-5140-0033 HOLDING HIS HAND AND LOOKING STEALTHILY HE SMILED SADLY AND SAID WHEN SOONER OR LATER THE TIME COMES AS HAGAR'S EYES WERE OPENED IN THE WILDERNESS AND SHE BEHELD THE FOUNTAIN OF WATER
2136-5140-0035 WITH STERN LIPS AND UPTURNED HANDS AND EYES AND AN ANGRY EXPOSTULATION I DO WONDER AT YOU MARY QUINCE LETTING THE CHILD WALK INTO THE WOOD WITH THAT LIMB OF DARKNESS IT IS A MERCY HE DID NOT SHOW HER THE DEVIL
2136-5140-0036 OR FRIGHTEN HER OUT OF HER SENSES IN THAT LONELY PLACE OF THESE SWEDENBORGIANS INDEED I KNOW NO MORE THAN I MIGHT LEARN FROM GOOD MISSUS RUSK'S VERY INACCURATE TALK TWO OR THREE OF THEM CROSSED IN THE COURSE OF MY EARLY LIFE
2136-5140-0038 AND INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE AND AS DEAR PAPA ACCEPTED THEIR IDEAS I AM HAPPY IN THINKING THAT THEY DID NOT CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HOLY WRIT LEANING ON MY HAND I WAS NOW LOOKING UPON THAT SOLEMN WOOD
2136-5140-0039 WHITE AND SHADOWY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHERE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT RAMBLE WITH THE VISIONARY I FANCIED THE GATE OF DEATH HIDDEN ONLY BY A STRANGE GLAMOUR AND THE DAZZLING LAND OF GHOSTS WERE SITUATE
2136-5143-0000 CHAPTER SIX A WALK IN THE WOOD TWO LITTLE PIECES OF BY PLAY IN WHICH I DETECTED HER CONFIRMED MY UNPLEASANT SUSPICION FROM THE CORNER OF THE GALLERY I ONE DAY SAW HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I WAS OUT AND ALL QUIET

2136-5143-0003 INDIGNATION HOWEVER QUICKLY RETURNED AND I CAME BACK TREADING BRISKLY AS I DID SO WHEN I REACHED THE ANGLE OF THE GALLERY AGAIN MADAME I SUPPOSE HAD HEARD ME FOR SHE WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS

2136-5147-0006 NOT SORRY SOMEHOW TO ESCAPE BEFORE CAPTAIN OAKLEY RETURNED AS I WENT ALONG THE PASSAGE I WAS THINKING WHETHER MY DRESS COULD BE SO VERY RIDICULOUS AS MY OLD COUSIN THOUGHT IT AND TRYING IN VAIN
2136-5147-0007 TO RECOLLECT ANY EVIDENCE OF A SIMILAR CONTEMPTUOUS ESTIMATE ON THE PART OF THAT BEAUTIFUL AND GARRULOUS DANDY I COULD NOT QUITE THE REVERSE INDEED STILL I WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND FEVERISH

2136-5147-0010 I TRY TO SWALLOW A LITTLE TO PLEASE HER AND YOUR COLD IS IT BETTER SHE SHOOK HER HEAD LANGUIDLY HER ELBOW RESTING ON THE CHAIR AND THREE FINGER TIPS SUPPORTING HER FOREHEAD AND THEN SHE MADE A LITTLE SIGH
2136-5147-0012 BUT I AM QUAITE APPY
2136-5147-0013 AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE TURNED A LANGUID GLANCE OF GRATITUDE ON ME WHICH DROPPED ON THE GROUND LADY KNOLLYS WISHES VERY MUCH TO SEE YOU ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES IF YOU COULD ADMIT HER
2136-5147-0015 OF HEAD AND OF THE EAR THE RIGHT EAR IT IS PARFOIS AGONY ABSOLUTELY AND NOW IT IS HERE AND SHE WINCED AND MOANED WITH HER EYES CLOSED AND HER HAND PRESSED TO THE ORGAN AFFECTED
2136-5147-0016 SIMPLE AS I WAS I FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT MADAME WAS SHAMMING SHE WAS OVER ACTING HER TRANSITIONS WERE TOO VIOLENT AND BESIDE SHE FORGOT THAT I KNEW HOW WELL SHE COULD SPEAK ENGLISH AND MUST PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS HEIGHTENING THE INTEREST OF HER HELPLESSNESS

2136-5147-0021 I RETURNED TO THE DRAWING ROOM

2136-5147-0024 YES AND REALLY AUSTIN IT IS QUITE CLEAR YOU OUGHT TO MARRY YOU WANT SOME ONE TO TAKE THIS GIRL OUT AND LOOK AFTER HER AND WHO'S TO DO IT
2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0027 AND THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HER THEN SHE HAS HAD HER SECOND HUSBAND SINCE I CAN TELL YOU I'M GLAD I WAS NOT THE FIRST SAID MY FATHER WELL THEY REALLY SAY HER WEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE HER LAST HUSBAND
2136-5147-0028 THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
2136-5147-0030 AND THINK THAT NO WIDOWER IS QUITE ABOVE OR BELOW THAT DANGER AND I REMEMBER WHENEVER MY FATHER WHICH INDEED WAS BUT SELDOM MADE A VISIT TO TOWN OR ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A SAYING OF MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0031 I SHAN'T WONDER NEITHER NEED YOU MY DEAR IF HE BRINGS HOME A YOUNG WIFE WITH HIM SO MY FATHER WITH A KIND LOOK AT HER AND A VERY TENDER ONE ON ME WENT SILENTLY TO THE LIBRARY AS HE OFTEN DID ABOUT THAT HOUR
2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL
2136-5147-0034 THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF THE SENTIMENT HAD NOT BEEN SO AWFULLY IRREVERENT WELL DEAR HOW IS OUR FRIEND THE MILLINER MADAME IS SUFFERING SO MUCH FROM PAIN IN HER EAR THAT SHE SAYS IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THE HONOUR HONOUR FIDDLE
2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
2159-179154-0001 THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
2159-179154-0002 IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
2159-179154-0004 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0005 WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
2159-179154-0007 AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
2159-179154-0008 THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
2159-179154-0010 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0011 HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0016 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0023 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0025 THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
2159-179154-0026 AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
2159-179154-0028 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0031 AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
2159-179154-0032 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0035 HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
2159-179154-0037 WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
2159-179154-0038 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0003 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0006 THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
2159-179156-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0009 THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
2159-179156-0010 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0012 BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
2159-179156-0013 I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
2159-179156-0015 BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
2159-179156-0016 WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
2159-179156-0018 HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
2159-179156-0019 BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0024 SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
2159-179156-0025 AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
2159-179156-0027 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179157-0000 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0004 BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
2159-179157-0006 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0010 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0012 I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0015 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0016 SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
2159-179157-0018 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0019 ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
2159-179157-0021 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0022 IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
2159-179157-0024 AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
2159-179157-0025 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0030 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0031 THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
2159-179157-0033 I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
2182-150130-0000 THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
2182-150130-0002 THE LADY ANNE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A TALL THIN DARK EYED DARK HAIRED HANDSOME YOUNG DAME OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAWK NOSED LIKE HER FATHER AND SILENT PROUD AND HAUGHTY MYLES HEARD THE SQUIRES SAY
2182-150130-0003 LADY ALICE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH'S NIECE AND WARD A GREAT HEIRESS IN HER OWN RIGHT A STRIKINGLY PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THESE COMPOSED THE EARL'S PERSONAL FAMILY
2182-150130-0005 FOR THE PRINCELY NOBLES OF THOSE DAYS LIVED IN STATE LITTLE LESS ROYAL THAN ROYALTY ITSELF MOST OF THE KNIGHTS AND GENTLEMEN MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BY SIGHT MEETING THEM IN LORD GEORGE'S APARTMENTS IN THE SOUTH WING OF THE GREAT HOUSE
2182-150130-0006 AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
2182-150130-0008 ONE OF WHICH IN REMEMBERING ALWAYS FILLED MYLES'S HEART IN AFTER YEARS WITH AN INDEFINABLE PLEASURE WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF STANDING WITH OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW SQUIRES
2182-150130-0009 WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
2182-150130-0011 THE DAINTIEST FARE LACKED IN AFTER YEARS THEN FALL PASSED AND WINTER CAME BLEAK COLD AND DREARY NOT WINTER AS WE KNOW IT NOWADAYS WITH WARM FIRES AND BRIGHT LIGHTS TO MAKE THE LONG NIGHTS SWEET AND CHEERFUL WITH COMFORT
2182-150130-0012 BUT WINTER WITH ALL ITS GRIMNESS AND STERNNESS IN THE GREAT COLD STONE WALLED CASTLES OF THOSE DAYS THE ONLY FIRE AND ALMOST THE ONLY LIGHT WERE THOSE FROM THE HUGE BLAZING LOGS THAT ROARED AND CRACKLED IN THE GREAT OPEN STONE FIREPLACE
2182-150130-0014 BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
2182-150130-0015 YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
2182-150130-0017 WHILE THE CROWS AND THE JACKDAWS LOOKED DOWN AT THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE BLEAK GRAY WALLS THEN AT YULE TIDE WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT OF A RUDE SEMBLANCE TO THE MERRY CHRISTMAS SEASON OF OUR DAY A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD IN THE HALL
2182-150130-0018 AND ALL THE CASTLE FOLK WERE FED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS OXEN AND SHEEP WERE ROASTED WHOLE HUGE SUET PUDDINGS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND STUFFED WITH PLUMS WERE BOILED IN GREAT CALDRONS IN THE OPEN COURTYARD
2182-150130-0020 FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
2182-150130-0021 AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
2182-150130-0023 FOR BOYS WERE BOYS AND PLAYED AT BALL EVEN IN THOSE FARAWAY DAYS A GAME CALLED TRAP BALL EVEN YET IN SOME PARTS OF ENGLAND IT IS PLAYED JUST AS IT WAS IN MYLES FALWORTH'S DAY AND ENJOYED JUST AS MYLES AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED IT
2182-150130-0024 SO NOW THAT THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WEATHER PLEASANT THE GAME OF TRAP BALL WAS IN FULL SWING EVERY AFTERNOON THE PLAY GROUND BEING AN OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CASTLE GROUNDS AND THAT OF THE PRIVY GARDEN
2182-150130-0026 AND SEVERAL OF THE LADS HAD GONE BACK ALMOST AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE PRIVY GARDEN TO CATCH ANY BALL THAT MIGHT CHANCE TO FLY AS FAR AS THAT THEN ONCE MORE MYLES STRUCK THROWING ALL HIS STRENGTH INTO THE BLOW THE BALL SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
2182-150130-0027 AND WHEN IT FELL IT WAS TO DROP WITHIN THE PRIVY GARDEN THE SHOUTS OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS WERE INSTANTLY STILLED AND GASCOYNE WHO STOOD NEAREST MYLES THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BELT GIVING A LONG SHRILL WHISTLE
2182-150130-0029 WOULDST GET THYSELF SHOT WITH A BOLT BETWIXT THE RIBS LIKE POOR DICCON COOK OF ALL PLACES ABOUT THE CASTLE THE PRIVY GARDEN WAS PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED IT WAS A SMALL PLOT OF GROUND ONLY A FEW RODS LONG AND WIDE
2182-150130-0030 AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE COUNTESS AND HER FAMILY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE MYLES HAD FIRST COME TO DEVLEN ONE OF THE COOK'S MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CLIMBING THE WALL WHEREUPON THE SOLDIER WHO SAW HIM SHOT HIM WITH HIS CROSS BOW
2182-150130-0032 HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE VENTURING TO ENTER THE LADIES PRIVATE GARDEN AS IT WAS HE ONLY SHOOK HIS STUBBORN HEAD AND SAID AGAIN I WILL CLIMB THE WALL AND FETCH IT
2182-150130-0033 NOW AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE COURT AND ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET DISTANT FROM THE GARDEN WALL THERE GREW A PEAR TREE SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH OVERHUNG INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND SO FIRST MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE WAS LOOKING THAT WAY
2182-150130-0035 HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
2182-150130-0036 HE NOTICED THE BROAD SMOOTH WALKS THE GRASSY TERRACE IN FRONT OF THE COUNTESS'S APARTMENTS IN THE DISTANCE THE QUAINT FLOWER BEDS THE YEW TREES TRIMMED INTO ODD SHAPES AND EVEN THE DEAF OLD GARDENER WORKING BARE ARMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AT A FLOWER BED IN THE FAR CORNER BY THE TOOL HOUSE
2182-150130-0038 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO DRAW BACK NOW BRACING HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT HE LOOSED HIS HOLD UPON THE LIMB ABOVE THE BRANCH FLEW BACK WITH A RUSH AND HE DROPPED STRIVING TO GRASP THE SLOPING ANGLE WITH HIS FEET
2182-150130-0039 FLEW THROUGH HIS BRAIN LIKE A CLOUD OF FLIES AND THEN A LEAFY GREENNESS SEEMED TO STRIKE UP AGAINST HIM A SPLINTERING CRASH SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS THE LATTICE TOP OF THE ARBOR BROKE UNDER HIM AND WITH ONE FINAL CLUTCH AT THE EMPTY AIR HE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND BENEATH
2182-181173-0001 IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
2182-181173-0002 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0004 LEAVING THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE STALL ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH AND NOT AT ALL BELIEVING IN HER GREAT FORTUNE ONCE WHEN I FELL DOWN AND CUT MY KNEE SHE GAVE ME AN APPLE FOR NOTHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER FOR IT YOU KNOW
2182-181173-0005 YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND TO YOU IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS HONEST SIMPLE LITTLE MIND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD FORGET KINDNESSES THE INTERVIEW WITH DICK WAS QUITE EXCITING
2182-181173-0007 THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
2182-181173-0008 MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
2182-181173-0010 AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
2182-181173-0011 HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
2182-181173-0013 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
2182-181173-0014 AND HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT HE FELT JUST THEN IF HE HAD TRIED PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY HE DIDN'T TRY AND ONLY WINKED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED A LUMP IN HIS THROAT I WISH YE WASN'T GOIN AWAY HE SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
2182-181173-0016 HE'S SUCH A GAME LITTLE FELLER AN' AN SUCH A QUEER LITTLE UN AND WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM IN A DAZED KIND OF WAY AND THERE WAS STILL A MIST IN HIS EYES AND A LUMP IN HIS THROAT
2182-181173-0017 AS HE WATCHED THE GALLANT LITTLE FIGURE MARCHING GAYLY ALONG BY THE SIDE OF ITS TALL RIGID ESCORT UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORDSHIP SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH MISTER HOBBS IN THE STORE
2182-181173-0019 HE LAID THE CASE ON HIS STOUT KNEE AND BLEW HIS NOSE VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON IT SAID CEDRIC INSIDE THE CASE I TOLD THE MAN MYSELF WHAT TO SAY
2182-181173-0020 FROM HIS OLDEST FRIEND LORD FAUNTLEROY TO MISTER HOBBS WHEN THIS YOU SEE REMEMBER ME I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET ME MISTER HOBBS BLEW HIS NOSE VERY LOUDLY AGAIN
2182-181173-0022 I SHOULDN'T FORGET YOU WHOEVER I WAS AMONG ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP I'VE SPENT MY HAPPIEST HOURS WITH YOU AT LEAST SOME OF MY HAPPIEST HOURS I HOPE YOU'LL COME TO SEE ME SOMETIME
2182-181173-0023 I'D COME TO SEE YOU REPLIED MISTER HOBBS GRACIOUSLY SO IT SEEMED TO BE AGREED THAT IF HE RECEIVED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM THE EARL TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS AT DORINCOURT CASTLE
2182-181173-0025 CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
2182-181173-0026 WE LIKED THIS LITTLE HOUSE DEAREST DIDN'T WE HE SAID WE ALWAYS WILL LIKE IT WON'T WE YES YES SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW SWEET VOICE YES DARLING
2182-181173-0028 BIG TRUNKS AND CASES WERE BEING BUMPED DOWN AND DRAGGED ABOUT SAILORS WERE UNCOILING ROPES AND HURRYING TO AND FRO OFFICERS WERE GIVING ORDERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND CHILDREN AND NURSES WERE COMING ON BOARD
2182-181173-0029 HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
2182-181173-0031 HE CAME UP TO CEDRIC QUITE BREATHLESS I'VE RUN ALL THE WAY HE SAID I'VE COME DOWN TO SEE YE OFF TRADE'S BEEN PRIME
2182-181173-0032 YE KIN WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS I LOST THE PAPER WHEN I WAS TRYIN TO GET THROUGH THEM FELLERS DOWNSTAIRS
2182-181173-0034 A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY SAW HIM STRUGGLE THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE LOWER DECK AND RUSH ON SHORE JUST BEFORE THE GANG PLANK WAS DRAWN IN HE STOOD ON THE WHARF AND WAVED HIS CAP CEDRIC HELD THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND
2182-181173-0035 IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
2182-181173-0037 AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
2182-181183-0000 OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
2182-181183-0002 WITH HANDSOME LEGS AND CURLY HAIR ONE SAID HE WAS NO RELATION TO THE EARL OF DORINCOURT AT ALL BUT WAS A SMALL IMPOSTOR WHO HAD SOLD NEWSPAPERS AND SLEPT IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK BEFORE HIS MOTHER IMPOSED UPON THE FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0003 WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
2182-181183-0005 IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
2182-181183-0006 THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
2182-181183-0008 THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND
2182-181183-0009 AN WE SAY HOLD ON AS LONGS U KIN
2182-181183-0011 AN IF THERE AINT NO BETTER WAY CUM OVER HERE AN GO IN PARDNERS WITH ME
2182-181183-0012 AN ILE SEE NO HARM CUMS TO U ENNY BIG FELER THAT TRISE TO CUM IT OVER U
2182-181183-0014 I BELIEVE ITS A PUT UP JOB AND THEM THATS DONE IT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AFTER SHARP AND WHAT I WRITE TO SAY IS TWO THINGS
2182-181183-0015 AND IF THE WORST HAPPENS AND THEM EARLS IS TOO MANY FOR US THERES A PARTNERSHIP IN THE GROCERY BUSINESS READY FOR YOU WHEN YURE OLD ENOUGH AND A HOME AND A FRIEND IN
2182-181183-0017 THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
2182-181183-0018 BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
2182-181183-0020 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0021 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2182-181183-0023 AS HE THREW THE PAPER DOWN ON THE COUNTER HELLO
2182-181183-0024 LOOK AT IT PANTED DICK
2182-181183-0026 THAT'S WHO DONE IT SHE WAS ALLERS UP TO HER TRICKS AN I'LL TELL YER WOT COME TO ME THE MINNIT I SAW HER PICTUR THERE WAS ONE O THEM PAPERS WE SAW HAD A LETTER IN IT THAT SAID SOMETHIN BOUT HER BOY AN IT SAID HE HAD A SCAR ON HIS CHIN
2182-181183-0027 PUT THEM TWO TOGETHER HER N THAT THERE SCAR WHY THAT THERE BOY O HERS AINT NO MORE A LORD THAN I AM IT'S BEN'S BOY THE LITTLE CHAP SHE HIT WHEN SHE LET FLY THAT PLATE AT ME
2182-181183-0029 AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
2182-181183-0030 THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
2182-181183-0032 MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
2182-181183-0033 FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
2182-181183-0035 AND ACTUALLY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN TWO LETTERS HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ONE SPEEDING OUT OF NEW YORK HARBOR ON A MAIL STEAMER ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND AND THE OTHER ON A TRAIN CARRYING LETTERS AND PASSENGERS BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA
2182-181183-0036 AND THE SECOND TO BENJAMIN TIPTON
2196-170151-0001 BUT WHAT TO OUR EYES MAY SEEM HOPELESS FAILURE IS OFTEN BUT THE DAWNING OF A GREATER SUCCESS IT MAY CONTAIN IN ITS DEBRIS THE FOUNDATION MATERIAL OF A MIGHTY PURPOSE OR THE REVELATION OF NEW AND HIGHER POSSIBILITIES
2196-170151-0002 SOME YEARS AGO IT WAS PROPOSED TO SEND LOGS FROM CANADA TO NEW YORK BY A NEW METHOD THE INGENIOUS PLAN OF MISTER JOGGINS WAS TO BIND GREAT LOGS TOGETHER BY CABLES AND IRON GIRDERS
2196-170151-0004 URGING THEM TO WATCH CAREFULLY FOR THESE LOGS WHICH HE DESCRIBED AND TO NOTE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EACH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND THE TIME THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE HUNDREDS OF CAPTAINS SAILING OVER THE WATERS OF THE EARTH
2196-170151-0005 NOTED THE LOGS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE SOUTH SEAS FOR INTO ALL WATERS DID THESE VENTURESOME ONES TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF REPORTS WERE MADE COVERING A PERIOD OF WEEKS AND MONTHS
2196-170151-0007 FOR IT LED TO ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES IN MODERN MARINE GEOGRAPHY AND NAVIGATION IN OUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DISPOSED TO SPEAK IN A PATRONIZING TONE
2196-170151-0008 BUT THEIR FAILURE TO TRANSMUTE THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF CHEMISTRY THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED BUT THEY BROUGHT INTO VOGUE THE NATURAL PROCESSES OF SUBLIMATION FILTRATION
2196-170151-0010 AND ITS USE IN GUNPOWDER AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTILLATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THIS WAS THE SUCCESS OF FAILURE A WONDROUS PROCESS OF NATURE FOR THE HIGHEST GROWTH A MIGHTY LESSON OF COMFORT STRENGTH AND ENCOURAGEMENT
2196-170151-0011 IN DISCOVERING AMERICA COLUMBUS FAILED ABSOLUTELY HIS INGENIOUS REASONING AND EXPERIMENT LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT BY SAILING WESTWARD HE WOULD REACH INDIA EVERY REDMAN IN AMERICA CARRIES IN HIS NAME INDIAN
2196-170151-0013 REALLY ATTESTED HIS FAILURE BUT THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA WAS A GREATER SUCCESS THAN WAS ANY FINDING OF A BACK DOOR TO INDIA WHEN DAVID LIVINGSTONE HAD SUPPLEMENTED HIS THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION BY A MEDICAL COURSE
2196-170151-0014 OPENED A WHOLE CONTINENT TO LIGHT AND TRUTH HIS STUDY PROVED AN IDEAL PREPARATION FOR HIS LABORS AS PHYSICIAN EXPLORER TEACHER AND EVANGEL IN THE WILDS OF AFRICA
2196-170151-0016 HIS BRUSH STROKES PUT ON IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS BEFORE GOING TO HIS MENIAL DUTIES AS A RAILWAY PORTER IN THE DUSK LIKE THAT PERPETUATED ON HIS CANVAS MEANT STRENGTH FOOD AND MEDICINE FOR THE DYING WIFE HE ADORED
2196-170151-0017 THE ART FAILURE THAT CAST HIM INTO THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY UNIFIED WITH MARVELLOUS INTENSITY ALL THE FINER ELEMENTS OF HIS NATURE THIS RARE SPIRITUAL UNITY
2196-170151-0019 FAILURE IS OFTEN THE TURNING POINT THE PIVOT OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SWINGS US TO HIGHER LEVELS IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IT MAY NOT BE FAME IT MAY BE NEW DRAUGHTS OF SPIRITUAL MORAL OR MENTAL INSPIRATION
2196-170151-0020 THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
2196-170151-0022 IT HAS NOT BEEN RICHES IT HAS BEEN DARK TREACHEROUS POVERTY THAT STOLE FROM ME EVEN MYSELF ALL THINGS BECOME FOR US THEN WHAT WE TAKE FROM THEM FAILURE IS ONE OF GOD'S EDUCATORS
2196-170151-0023 IT IS EXPERIENCE LEADING MAN TO HIGHER THINGS IT IS THE REVELATION OF A WAY A PATH HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO US THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE GREATEST REAL SUCCESSES
2196-170151-0025 MELTED INTO THIN AIR AS HIS HAND SOUGHT TO CLUTCH IT FAILURE IS OFTEN THE ROCK BOTTOM FOUNDATION OF REAL SUCCESS IF MAN IN A FEW INSTANCES OF HIS LIFE CAN SAY
2196-170151-0026 THE DEATH OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SEED IS THE PRELUDE TO ITS RESURRECTION AS WHEAT IT IS AT NIGHT IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE PRECEDING DAWN THAT PLANTS GROW BEST THAT THEY MOST INCREASE IN SIZE
2196-170151-0028 LEAVING THE RESULTS TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INFINITE IF WE THINK OF ANY SUPREME MOMENT OF OUR LIVES ANY GREAT SUCCESS ANY ONE WHO IS DEAR TO US AND THEN CONSIDER HOW WE REACHED THAT MOMENT THAT SUCCESS
2196-170151-0029 WE WILL SEE HOW LOGICAL HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF OUR JOY AND SUCCESS FROM SORROW AND FAILURE AND THAT WHAT GIVES US MOST HAPPINESS TO DAY IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED WITH WHAT ONCE CAUSED US SORROW
2196-170151-0031 IN CONTINUOUS HARMONY WITH THEM
2196-170151-0032 NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
2196-170151-0034 WHEN THE SAILS FLAP IDLY AGAINST THE UNSTRAINED MASTS
2196-170379-0000 IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
2196-170379-0002 BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
2196-170379-0003 AND WHICH DREW THEIR UNIQUE QUALITIES FROM THE SUN MOON AND STARS CHARCOT
2196-170379-0005 NOTABLY DOCTOR WILLIAM S KROGER A PSYCHIATRICALLY ORIENTED OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST WHO LIMITS HIS PRACTICE TO HYPNOTHERAPY BELIEVE HYPNOSIS IS A CONVICTION PHENOMENON WHICH PRODUCES RESULTS THAT PARALLEL THE PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0006 PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
2196-170379-0008 THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY OF COURSE WITH THE AUTHOR'S ALREADY DISCUSSED VISUAL IMAGERY TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF IMAGINATION DOCTOR KROGER LIKE A FEW OTHERS HAS PROVED TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION THAT ALL HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0009 CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
2196-170379-0011 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0012 ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT A STRONG INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HYPNOSIS IN THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK I EXPLAINED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTION IN WHICH THE SUBJECT ADOPTED AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE
2196-170379-0014 HYPNOTISTS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO USE ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW IT HAS BEEN HARNESSED FOR THEIR USE
2196-170379-0015 IF THERE IS ONE THING VIRTUALLY CERTAIN ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT IS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE INHIBITED AND OTHER PARTS EXPANDED BY THE PROCESS
2196-170379-0017 WE DO NOT KNOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS METAMORPHOSIS OF AN ORDINARY BRAIN INTO AN ORGAN OF CONCENTRATED POWER ACCORDING TO JANET THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES
2196-170379-0018 WHICH TAKES OVER THE USUAL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TYPE OF THINKING IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE PROCESS MAY BE ATAVISTIC ONE OF THE NEWER THEORIES ONE HELD BY DOCTOR LEWIS R WOLBERG A PSYCHOANALYST
2196-170379-0020 BUT THAT IT IS MORE OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUBJECT'S OWN PSYCHIC PROCESSES WHICH IS ENLARGED TO INCLUDE THE VOICE OF THE HYPNOTIST OR HIS OWN THOUGHTS OR VOICE INCIDENTALLY AN EXCELLENT BOOK ALONG THESE THEORETICAL LINES IS HYPNOTISM
2196-170379-0021 ACTUALLY HYPNOTISTS TODAY
2196-170379-0023 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
2196-170379-0024 MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
2196-170379-0026 OF ANIMALS TO AVOID DANGER OTHERS PRIMARILY EUROPEANS HAVE POINTED OUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE HYPNOTIC STATE OF ANIMALS AND MAN ANOTHER WIDELY HELD THEORY IS THAT HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF DISSOCIATION
2196-170379-0027 MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
2196-170379-0029 THIRDLY FROM THE PERSON ACTING AS A HYPNOTIZED PERSON ROLE PLAYING AND FOURTHLY FROM A SUSPENSION OF THE CRITICAL FACULTIES ALONG THE LAST NAMED LINE I BELIEVE THAT HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS
2196-170379-0030 WHICH SUPERSEDE ALL ELSE IN THE HYPNOTIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY MORE THEORIES I BELIEVE ARE PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT THE ONES NAMED WILL DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS VOLUME INCIDENTALLY
2196-170379-0032 WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
2196-170379-0033 UNLESS DEFINITE SLEEP SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN BY THE THERAPIST'S SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND AT LENGTH AND SURELY NOTHING CONNOTATES SLEEP MORE THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES
2196-174172-0000 SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE YOUTH IS ETERNAL NATURE NEVER GROWS OLD THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN EDEN ARE BLOOMING TO DAY JUST AS LOVELY JUST AS SWEET
2196-174172-0001 JUST AS FRESH AND UNCHANGED THE ROSES YOUR LIFE MATE BRINGS HOME TO YOU HAVE THE SAME FRAGRANCE AS THE ROSES ADAM BROUGHT TO EVE IF HE THOUGHT OF IT
2196-174172-0003 THEN YOUR YOUTH MAY BE PERPETUAL THE HUMAN RACE IS EVER YOUNG ITS UNITS FALL OFF YOU SHOULD BE YOUNGER AT SIXTY THAN AT SIXTEEN
2196-174172-0004 GROWING OLD IS A HABIT PEOPLE TRAVEL ALONG THE YEARS UP THE HILL OF LIFE TILL THEY REACH A CERTAIN POINT WHERE THEY BEGIN TO THINK THEY MUST BE GROWING OLD THINK ITS TIME TO SAG THINK ITS TIME TO DROOP
2196-174172-0006 AND THEY ARE OLD LIFE IS ENDLESS BUT YOU CAN THINK IT SHORT THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE IS WITHIN YOU BUT BY THINKING YOU CAN TURN IT TO THE WHITE ASHES OF OLD AGE THINK YOUTH
2196-174172-0007 AND YOU STAY YOUNG YOUTH IS GROWTH KEEP GROWING AND YOU KEEP YOUNG A NEW IDEA WILL MAKE YOU FEEL YOUNGER DEVELOP IT AND IT WILL DEVELOP YOU QUICKEN YOUR MENTAL THROB WITH NEW IDEAS
2196-174172-0009 THE ROSE BUSH ON A WALL IN CHINA IS SUPPOSED TO BE OVER A THOUSAND YEARS OLD IT BEARS MORE ROSES NOW THAN WHEN IT WAS A MERE SLIP OF A VINE OF ONLY ONE HUNDRED

2196-174172-0022 INERTIA IS DEATH MEN AND WOMEN DO NOT USUALLY LOSE THEIR POSITIONS THEY DRIVE THEIR POSITIONS AWAY FROM THEM THE LAW OF WORK WILL NOT STAND PERSONAL ABUSE

2289-152253-0000 THE HUNS HAD A FAMOUS KING NAMED AT'TI LA HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME THEIR KING BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS YOUNG HE WAS VERY BRAVE AND AMBITIOUS AND HE WANTED TO BE A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING NOT FAR FROM ATTILA'S PALACE
2289-152253-0002 HE WAS VERY OLD WITH WRINKLED FACE AND LONG GRAY HAIR AND BEARD MANY PERSONS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A FORTUNE TELLER SO PEOPLE OFTEN WENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM
2289-152253-0003 ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER HE BECAME KING ATTILA WENT TO THE CAVE TO GET HIS FORTUNE TOLD WISE MAN SAID HE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND TELL ME WHAT IS BEFORE ME IN THE PATH OF LIFE THE HERMIT THOUGHT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID
2289-152253-0005 BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF SPIRIT AND VERY SOON HE REMEMBERED ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM ABOUT HIS BECOMING A GREAT AND FAMOUS CONQUEROR AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR HE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BEST MEN
2289-152253-0006 FROM THE VARIOUS TRIBES OF HIS PEOPLE AND TRAINED THEM INTO A GREAT ARMY OF GOOD SOLDIERS TWO ABOUT THIS TIME ONE OF THE KING'S SHEPHERDS WHILE TAKING CARE OF CATTLE IN THE FIELDS
2289-152253-0008 AS LONG AS I FIGHT WITH THE SWORD OF TIEW AS SOON AS HIS ARMY WAS READY HE MARCHED WITH IT INTO COUNTRIES WHICH BELONGED TO ROME HE DEFEATED THE ROMANS IN SEVERAL GREAT BATTLES AND CAPTURED MANY OF THEIR CITIES
2289-152253-0009 THE ROMAN EMPEROR THEODOSIUS HAD TO ASK FOR TERMS OF PEACE ATTILA AGREED THAT THERE SHOULD BE PEACE BUT SOON AFTERWARDS HE FOUND OUT THAT THEODOSIUS HAD FORMED A PLOT TO MURDER HIM
2289-152253-0011 AND AT LAST THE EMPEROR HAD TO GIVE HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
2289-152253-0012 THIS MADE PEACE BUT THE PEACE DID NOT LAST LONG IN A FEW YEARS ATTILA APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN WITH THIS GREAT FORCE HE MARCHED ACROSS GERMANY AND INTO GAUL
2289-152253-0014 ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
2289-152253-0015 IN THOSE TIMES ALL TOWNS OF ANY GREAT SIZE WERE SURROUNDED BY STRONG WALLS THERE WAS WAR CONSTANTLY GOING ON
2289-152253-0017 WERE NOT SAFE WITHOUT HIGH AND STRONG WALLS ATTILA TRIED TO TAKE ORLEANS BUT SOON AFTER HE BEGAN TO ATTACK THE WALLS HE SAW A GREAT ARMY AT A DISTANCE COMING TOWARDS THE CITY
2289-152253-0018 THE ARMY WHICH ATTILA SAW WAS AN ARMY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS IT WAS LED BY A ROMAN GENERAL
2289-152253-0020 HAD SETTLED IN PARTS OF GAUL AND THEIR KING HAD NOW AGREED TO JOIN THE ROMANS AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY THE TERRIBLE HUNS SO THE GREAT ARMY OF THE ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS
2289-152253-0021 THOR'IS MOND THE SON OF THEODORIC
2289-152253-0023 AND ATTILA HIMSELF FLED TO HIS CAMP IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER BEEN DEFEATED THORISMOND THE CONQUEROR WAS LIFTED UPON HIS SHIELD ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND HAILED AS KING OF THE VISIGOTHS
2289-152253-0024 WHEN ATTILA REACHED HIS CAMP HE HAD ALL HIS BAGGAGE AND WAGONS GATHERED IN A GREAT HEAP HE INTENDED TO SET FIRE TO IT AND JUMP INTO THE FLAMES IF THE ROMANS SHOULD COME THERE TO ATTACK HIM
2289-152253-0026 VERY SOON HOWEVER HE WAS AGAIN ON THE WAR PATH THIS TIME HE INVADED ITALY
2289-152253-0027 AND THEY HAD NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND AGAINST HIM ROME WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN DESTROYED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR POPE LEO
2289-152253-0029 THEY ENCLOSED HIS BODY IN THREE COFFINS ONE OF GOLD ONE OF SILVER AND ONE OF IRON
2289-152253-0030 WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER THEY KILLED THE SLAVES WHO HAD DUG THE GRAVE
2289-152254-0001 BUT A PLOT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM
2289-152254-0002 AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST ROME AT THE SAME TIME HE WROTE SECRETLY TO COUNT BONIFACE AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE CAME TO ROME THE EMPRESS WOULD PUT HIM TO DEATH BONIFACE BELIEVED THIS STORY
2289-152254-0004 AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
2289-152254-0005 BUT GENSERIC STERNLY REFUSED NEVER HE SAID SHALL I GO BACK TO SPAIN UNTIL I AM MASTER OF AFRICA THEN CRIED BONIFACE I WILL DRIVE YOU BACK SOON AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND VANDALS AND THE ROMANS WERE DEFEATED
2289-152254-0007 DESTROYS VALUABLE PROPERTY A GREAT MANY OF THE NATIVES OF AFRICA JOINED THE ARMY OF GENSERIC THEY HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN ILL TREATED BY THE ROMANS AND WERE GLAD TO SEE THEM DEFEATED
2289-152254-0008 HE BUILT GREAT FLEETS AND SAILED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPTURING TRADING VESSELS FOR MANY YEARS HE PLUNDERED TOWNS ALONG THE COASTS
2289-152254-0010 I BRING YOU A MESSAGE FROM THE EMPRESS EUDOXIA SHE BEGS YOUR HELP SHE AND HER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS ARE IN DANGER IN ROME SHE WISHES YOU TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST MAXIMUS SHE INVITES YOU TO COME WITH AN ARMY TO ROME AND TAKE THE CITY
2289-152254-0011 SHE AND HER FRIENDS WILL HELP YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WITH A CRY OF JOY GENSERIC SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND EXCLAIMED TELL THE EMPRESS THAT I ACCEPT HER INVITATION I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY
2289-152254-0013 TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
2289-152254-0014 IT WAS ONLY FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE ALARIC HAD BEEN THERE
2289-152254-0016 AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PRIVATE HOUSES
2289-152254-0017 SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
2289-152254-0019 BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
2289-152254-0020 AS HE WENT ALONG BEFORE SAILING WITH HIS ARMY FOR CARTHAGE HE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE VANDALS WERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE SO POWERFUL AT HOME AS WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED
2289-152254-0022 BUT GENSERIC DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ROMAN FLEET TO COME TO ATTACK HIM IN HIS CAPITAL WHEN HE GOT WORD THAT IT WAS IN THE BAY OF CARTHAGENA HE SAILED THERE WITH A FLEET OF HIS OWN AND IN A SINGLE DAY BURNED OR SANK NEARLY ALL THE ROMAN SHIPS
2289-152254-0023 AFTER THIS THE VANDALS BECAME MORE THAN EVER THE TERROR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE COUNTRIES BORDERING UPON IT EVERY YEAR THEIR SHIPS WENT ROUND THE COASTS FROM ASIA MINOR TO SPAIN ATTACKING AND PLUNDERING CITIES ON THEIR WAY
2289-152254-0025 TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE PIRATES THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SHIPS IN THIS FLEET AND THEY CARRIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
2289-152254-0026 THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
2289-152254-0028 IN AMONG THE ROMAN SHIPS TOWING BEHIND THEM LARGE BOATS FILLED WITH MATERIAL THAT WOULD EASILY BURN THESE BOATS WERE SET ON FIRE AND FLOATED AGAINST THE ROMAN VESSELS WHICH ALSO WERE SOON ON FIRE THE FLAMES QUICKLY SPREAD
2289-152254-0029 AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME A GREAT PART OF THE ROMAN FLEET WAS DESTROYED BASILICUS FLED WITH AS MANY SHIPS AS HE COULD SAVE AND RETURNED TO CONSTANTINOPLE THIS WAS THE LAST ATTEMPT OF THE ROMANS TO CONQUER THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0001 BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
2289-152257-0002 TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS BOY'S UNCLE WHO WAS NAMED JUSTIN HAD GONE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND JOINED THE ROMAN ARMY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO GOOD A SOLDIER THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE
2289-152257-0004 AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
2289-152257-0005 AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
2289-152257-0007 RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
2289-152257-0008 IN RULING THE EMPIRE JUSTINUS AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR HE WAS NOW OLD AND IN FEEBLE HEALTH AND NOT ABLE HIMSELF TO ATTEND TO THE IMPORTANT AFFAIRS OF GOVERNMENT
2289-152257-0010 HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
2289-152257-0011 HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
2289-152257-0013 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152257-0014 HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0016 GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
2289-152257-0017 AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
2289-152257-0019 BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
2289-152257-0020 LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
2289-152257-0022 FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
2289-152257-0023 THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
2289-152257-0025 TRIB O'NI AN TO COLLECT AND SIMPLIFY THE PRINCIPAL LAWS THE COLLECTION WHICH HE MADE WAS CALLED THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN IT STILL EXISTS AND IS THE MODEL ACCORDING TO WHICH MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE MADE THEIR LAWS
2289-152257-0026 JUSTINIAN ALSO DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD BY ESTABLISHING A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURES IN CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS HE WHO FIRST BROUGHT SILK WORMS INTO EUROPE TO THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE JUSTINIAN WAS STRONG AND ACTIVE
2289-152258-0000 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND AFRICA AND MUCH OF THOSE IN TURKEY IN EUROPE PROFESS THE MO HAM'ME DAN RELIGION THEY ARE CALLED MOHAMMEDANS MUS'SUL MANS OR MOSLEMS
2289-152258-0001 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0003 AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
2289-152258-0004 AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
2289-152258-0006 AND SOLD THERE THE GOODS CARRIED BY THE CAMELS
2289-152258-0007 AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
2289-152258-0009 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
2289-152258-0010 SHE SAID I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU AMONG THE TRADERS
2289-152258-0012 KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
2289-152258-0013 AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
2289-152258-0015 WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
2289-152258-0016 IN A CAVE ON MOUNT HIRA NEAR MECCA HE SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS EVERY YEAR IN PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS MEDITATION HE DECLARED THAT WHILE PRAYING IN HIS CAVE HE OFTEN HAD VISIONS OF GOD AND HEAVEN
2289-152258-0018 THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE KORAN WHICH MEANS LIKE OUR OWN WORD BIBLE THE BOOK
2289-152258-0019 THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
2289-152258-0021 SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
2289-152258-0022 LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
2289-152258-0024 AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
2289-152258-0025 PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
2289-152258-0027 AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
2289-152258-0028 THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
2289-152258-0030 HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
2289-152258-0031 HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
2289-152258-0033 THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
2289-152258-0034 EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
2289-152258-0036 THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
2289-152258-0037 IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
2289-152258-0039 BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
2289-152258-0040 AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002 IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0004 CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0007 COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0010 AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0019 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020 THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0022 THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0028 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0031 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032 BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0034 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035 HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038 SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0040 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044 THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0046 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047 AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0049 IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0052 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0055 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056 MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0061 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062 THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0067 WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0070 AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0073 A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0076 TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0079 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0082 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083 THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0085 AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0088 BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0091 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092 I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0094 AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0097 THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0100 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101 IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0103 BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104 OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0106 IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107 THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0109 BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113 ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0115 A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116 I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0118 THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0121 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
2416-152137-0001 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
2416-152137-0002 AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0005 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
2416-152137-0007 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0008 SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
2416-152137-0010 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0013 HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
2416-152137-0014 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0016 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0019 TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
2416-152137-0020 HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
2416-152137-0022 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK

2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152137-0034 AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE

2436-2481-0015 DOCTOR FRANK AND HER BROTHER ARE WITH HER THEY'RE DOING ALL THEY CAN HE TOLD US WHAT HAD HAPPENED ANITA AND GEORGE PRINCE HAD BOTH BEEN ASLEEP EACH IN HIS RESPECTIVE ROOM SOMEONE UNKNOWN
2436-2481-0017 IT WASN'T BROKEN THE ASSAILANT OPENED IT SOMEHOW AND ASSAULTED MISS PRINCE SHOT HER IN THE CHEST WITH A HEAT RAY HER LEFT LUNG SHOT HER YES BUT SHE DID NOT SEE WHO DID IT
2436-2481-0018 NOR DID PRINCE HER SCREAM AWAKENED HIM
2436-2481-0020 IT HAD ONLY A BUNK MY TINY DESK A CHAIR AND CLOTHES ROBE THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY INTRUDER HERE I SET MY DOOR AND WINDOW ALARM THEN I AUDIPHONED TO THE RADIO ROOM SNAP YES
2436-2481-0021 I TOLD HIM ABOUT ANITA CARTER CUT IN ON US FROM THE CHART ROOM STOP THAT YOU FOOLS WE CUT OFF FULLY DRESSED I FLUNG MYSELF ON MY BED ANITA MIGHT DIE I MUST HAVE FALLEN INTO A
2436-2481-0023 SOMEONE OUTSIDE TRYING TO UNSEAL THE DOOR IN THE DARKNESS CYLINDER IN HAND I CREPT SOFTLY FROM THE BUNK CROUCHED AT THE DOOR THIS TIME I WOULD CAPTURE OR KILL THIS NIGHT PROWLER
2436-2481-0024 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0026 HIS ELECTRONIZED METALLIC ROBE BURNED MY HANDS I LUNGED AGAINST HIM I WAS ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE I SHOT BUT THE STAB OF HEAT EVIDENTLY MISSED HIM THE SHOCK OF MY ENCOUNTER SHORT CIRCUITED HIS ROBE HE MATERIALIZED IN THE STARLIGHT A BRIEF
2436-2481-0027 SAVAGE ENCOUNTER HE STRUCK THE WEAPON FROM MY HAND HE HAD DROPPED HIS HYDROGEN TORCH AND TRIED TO GRIP ME BUT I TWISTED AWAY FROM HIS HOLD SO IT'S YOU QUIET GREGG HALJAN I ONLY WANT TO TALK WITHOUT WARNING A STAB OF RADIANCE SHOT FROM A WEAPON IN HIS HAND
2436-2481-0029 AND HEAR HIM I DON'T WANT TO KILL YOU HALJAN WE NEED YOU HE GATHERED ME UP LIKE A BUNDLE IN HIS HUGE ARMS CARRIED ME SWIFTLY ACROSS THE DESERTED DECK
2436-2481-0030 HIS WARNING SIREN RANG OUT TO ALERT THE SHIP HIS SPOTLIGHT CLUNG TO US MIKO RAN WITH ME A FEW STEPS THEN HE CURSED AND DROPPED ME FLED AWAY I FELL LIKE A SACK OF CARBIDE TO THE DECK
2436-2481-0032 SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED DIED I LEAPED TO MY FEET SHE DIED YES GREGG AN HOUR AGO
2436-2481-0033 MIKO GOT INTO HER STATEROOM AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS LOVE UPON HER SHE REPULSED HIM HE KILLED HER IT STRUCK ME BLANK AND THEN WITH A RUSH CAME THE THOUGHT
2436-2481-0035 DOCTOR FRANK GRIPPED ME THE CAPTAIN SAID GENTLY WE KNOW HOW YOU FEEL GREGG SHE TOLD US BEFORE SHE DIED I'LL BRING HIM IN HERE TO YOU BUT I'LL KILL HIM I TELL YOU NO YOU WON'T LAD
2436-2481-0036 WE DON'T WANT HIM KILLED NOT ATTACKED EVEN NOT YET WE'LL EXPLAIN LATER THEY SAT ME DOWN CALMING ME ANITA DEAD
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2518-154825-0000 HOW FEARFUL AND DIZZY TIS TO CAST ONE'S EYES SO LOW I'LL LOOK NO MORE
2518-154825-0001 SHAKESPEARE THE WHILE CHALK WAS A BULWARK BETWEEN US AND THE FOE AND THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM LOOSED OFF THEIR MATCHLOCKS TRYING TO GET AT US SIDEWAYS THEY COULD NOT EVEN SEE THEIR QUARRY
2518-154825-0003 SAFE WITH A DISCHARGED PISTOL IN OUR GRASP AND A SHOT MAN LYING AT OUR FEET ELZEVIR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK CAN YOU STAND JOHN IS THE BONE BROKEN
2518-154825-0004 I CANNOT STAND I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING GONE IN MY LEG AND I FEEL BLOOD RUNNING DOWN INTO MY BOOT HE KNELT AND ROLLED DOWN THE LEG OF MY STOCKING BUT THOUGH HE ONLY MOVED MY FOOT
2518-154825-0006 BUT I WILL PUT A KERCHIEF ROUND AND WHILE I WRAP IT LISTEN TO HOW WE LIE AND THEN CHOOSE WHAT WE SHALL DO I NODDED BITING MY LIPS HARD TO CONCEAL THE PAIN HE GAVE ME AND HE WENT ON
2518-154825-0007 WE HAVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE POSSE CAN GET DOWN TO US BUT COME THEY WILL AND THOU CANST JUDGE WHAT CHANCE WE HAVE TO SAVE LIBERTY
2518-154825-0009 AND THEREFORE DO NOT BLAME THEE IF THOU DIDST MAKE ME WASTE A CHARGE IN AIR SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS TO WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY COME AND I CAN ACCOUNT FOR A FEW OF THEM BEFORE THEY SHOOT ME DOWN BUT THOU CANST NOT FIGHT WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0010 AND THEY WILL TAKE THEE ALIVE AND THEN THERE IS A DANCE ON AIR AT DORCHESTER JAIL I FELT SICK WITH PAIN AND BITTERLY CAST DOWN TO THINK THAT I WAS LIKE TO COME SO SOON TO SUCH A VILE END
2518-154825-0012 THERE IS YET ANOTHER WAY THAT WE MAY TRY AND IF THOU HADST BUT TWO WHOLE LEGS I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT BUT NOW TIS LITTLE SHORT OF MADNESS AND YET IF THOU FEAR'ST NOT I WILL STILL TRY IT
2518-154825-0013 JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
2518-154825-0015 I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE HAD CLIMBED IT AND THAT WAS LANDER JORDAN WHEN THE EXCISE WAS ON HIS HEELS HALF A CENTURY BACK BUT HE THAT TRIES IT STAKES ALL ON HEAD AND FOOT AND A WOUNDED BIRD LIKE THEE MAY NOT DARE THAT FLIGHT
2518-154825-0016 YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY
2518-154825-0018 TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0019 AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF
2518-154825-0021 FOR THE ZIGZAG STARTED OFF AS A FAIR ENOUGH CHALK PATH BUT IN A FEW PACES NARROWED DOWN TILL IT WAS BUT A WHITER THREAD AGAINST THE GREY WHITE CLIFF FACE
2518-154825-0022 FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG
2518-154825-0024 WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO
2518-154825-0025 WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING
2518-154825-0027 IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED
2518-154825-0028 AND NOT A MAN IN ALL THE WORLD TO DO IT WITH A FULL GROWN LAD IN HIS ARMS YET ELZEVIR MADE NO BONES OF IT NOR SPOKE A SINGLE WORD ONLY HE WENT VERY SLOW AND I FELT HIM SCUFFLE WITH HIS FOOT
2518-154825-0030 AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP
2518-154825-0031 BUT OPEN NOT THY EYES TILL I HAVE SET THEE DOWN AND BID THEE I DID AS BIDDEN AND HE LOWERED ME GENTLY SETTING ME ON ALL FOURS UPON THE PATH AND SPEAKING AGAIN
2518-154825-0033 FOR THERE IS NO ROOM TO DANCE HORNPIPES HERE AND HOLD THY EYES FIXED ON THE CHALK WALL LOOKING NEITHER DOWN NOR SEAWARD TWAS WELL HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO AND WELL I DID IT
2518-154825-0034 BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE
2518-154825-0036 BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT
2518-154825-0037 AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH
2518-154825-0039 BOTH WERE ON ALL FOURS NOW ELZEVIR FIRST AND I FOLLOWING BUT AS I CREPT ALONG I RELAXED CARE FOR A MOMENT AND MY EYES WANDERED FROM THE CLIFF SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AND FAR BELOW
2518-154825-0040 I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT
2518-154825-0042 AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT
2518-154825-0043 I SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF DOWN IN SHEER DESPAIR TO GET QUIT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS KEEP THINE EYES SHUT JOHN HE SAID AND COUNT UP NUMBERS LOUD TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THOU ART NOT TURNING FAINT
2518-154825-0045 AND IN FIVE MORE THEY WILL BE ON THE UNDER CLIFF AND IF WE EVER REACH THE TOP WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAVE LEFT A GUARD NO NO THEY WILL NOT LEAVE A GUARD FOR NOT A MAN KNOWS OF THE ZIGZAG AND IF THEY KNEW
2518-154825-0046 LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
2518-154825-0048 I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES
2518-154825-0049 I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID
2518-154825-0051 MOVE THOU MUST AND TIS BETTER TO RISK FALLING NOW THAN FALL FOR CERTAIN WITH ANOTHER BULLET IN THEE LATER ON AND WITH THAT HE SHIFTED HIS HAND FROM MY BACK AND FIXED IT IN MY COAT COLLAR MOVING BACKWARDS HIMSELF AND SETTING TO DRAG ME AFTER HIM
2518-154825-0052 NOW I WAS SO BESOTTED WITH FRIGHT THAT I WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH FEARING TO FALL OVER IF I OPENED MY EYES AND ELZEVIR FOR ALL HE WAS SO STRONG COULD NOT PULL A HELPLESS LUMP BACKWARDS UP THAT PATH
2518-154825-0054 IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT
2518-154825-0055 AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR
2518-154826-0000 THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
2518-154826-0001 WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
2518-154826-0003 AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND
2518-154826-0004 THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL
2518-154826-0006 AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
2518-154826-0007 THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
2518-154826-0009 THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
2518-154826-0010 IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
2518-154826-0012 BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
2518-154826-0013 THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
2518-154826-0015 SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
2518-154826-0016 I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY
2518-154826-0018 AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
2518-154826-0019 AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER
2518-154826-0021 THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
2518-154826-0022 BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
2518-154826-0024 ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL
2518-154826-0025 WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
2518-154826-0027 HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL
2518-154826-0028 NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
2518-154826-0030 BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER
2518-154826-0031 THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
2518-154826-0033 THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2518-154826-0034 AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH
2518-154826-0036 THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY
2518-154826-0037 WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
2518-154826-0039 ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
2518-154826-0040 ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
2518-154826-0042 FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
2518-154826-0043 WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART
2518-154826-0045 AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH
2518-154826-0046 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0048 AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS
2518-154826-0049 THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
2518-154826-0051 AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
2518-154826-0052 HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND
2518-154826-0054 AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
2691-156745-0000 ORPHANS KESEBERG AND HIS ACCUSERS SENSATIONAL ACCOUNTS OF THE TRAGEDY AT DONNER LAKE PROPERTY SOLD AND GUARDIAN APPOINTED KINDLY INDIANS GRANDPA
2691-156745-0002 NOW DO SAY SOMETHING COMFORTING TO THESE POOR LITTLE GIRLS WHO WERE FROZEN AND STARVED UP IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ARE NOW ORPHANS IN A STRANGE LAND WITHOUT ANY HOME OR ANY ONE TO CARE FOR THEM SUCH ORDEALS WERE TOO OVERWHELMING
2691-156745-0003 I WOULD RUSH OFF ALONE AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS TO GET AWAY FROM THE TORTURING SYMPATHY EVEN THERE I MET THOSE WHO WOULD LOOK AT ME WITH GREAT SERIOUS EYES SHAKE THEIR HEADS AND MOURNFULLY SAY YOU POOR LITTLE MITE
2691-156745-0005 AND I KNEW THAT MOTHER DID NOT WANT ME TO BE THERE EITHER HAD SHE NOT SENT ME AWAY TO SAVE ME AND ASKED GOD OUR HEAVENLY FATHER TO TAKE CARE OF ME
2691-156745-0006 INTENSE EXCITEMENT AND INDIGNATION PREVAILED AT THE FORT AFTER CAPTAIN FALLON AND OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY GAVE THEIR ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITIONS FOUND AT THE MOUNTAIN CAMPS AND OF INTERVIEWS HAD WITH KESEBERG WHOM THEY NOW CALLED CANNIBAL
2691-156745-0008 BUT ALSO OF HAVING WANTONLY TAKEN THE LIFE OF MISSUS MURPHY AND OF MY MOTHER SOME DECLARED HIM CRAZY OTHERS CALLED HIM A MONSTER KESEBERG DENIED THESE CHARGES AND
2691-156745-0009 HE STATED THAT MISSUS MURPHY HAD DIED OF STARVATION SOON AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE THIRD RELIEF AND THAT MY MOTHER HAD WATCHED BY FATHER'S BEDSIDE UNTIL HE DIED
2691-156745-0011 AND FINALLY REACHED HIS CABIN WET SHIVERING AND GRIEF STRICKEN YET DETERMINED TO PUSH ONWARD SHE HAD BROUGHT NOTHING WITH HER BUT TOLD HIM WHERE TO FIND MONEY TO TAKE TO HER CHILDREN IN THE EVENT OF HER NOT REACHING THEM
2691-156745-0012 HE STATED THAT HE OFFERED HER FOOD WHICH SHE REFUSED HE THEN ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE HER TO WAIT UNTIL MORNING AND WHILE THEY WERE TALKING SHE SANK UPON THE FLOOR COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED AND HE COVERED HER WITH BLANKETS AND MADE A FIRE TO WARM HER
2691-156745-0014 SAVED HIM FROM PERSONAL VIOLENCE BUT NOT FROM SUSPICION AND ILL WILL WOMEN SHUNNED HIM AND CHILDREN STONED HIM AS HE WALKED ABOUT THE FORT THE CALIFORNIA STAR PRINTED IN FULL THE ACCOUNT OF THE FALLON PARTY
2691-156745-0015 AND BLOOD CURDLING EDITORIALS INCREASED PUBLIC SENTIMENT AGAINST KESEBERG STAMPING HIM WITH THE MARK OF CAIN AND CLOSING THE DOOR OF EVERY HOME AGAINST HIM
2691-156745-0017 MORE DISAPPOINTMENTS FOR US WERE BREWING AT THE FORT FALLON'S PARTY DEMANDED AN IMMEDIATE SETTLEMENT OF ITS CLAIM IT HAD GONE UP THE MOUNTAINS UNDER PROMISE THAT ITS MEMBERS SHOULD HAVE NOT ONLY A PER DIEM AS RESCUERS
2691-156745-0018 TAKEN FROM CONCEALMENT ON KESEBERG'S PERSON AND TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS ADDITIONAL TAKEN FROM A CACHE THAT KESEBERG HAD DISCLOSED AFTER THE CAPTAIN HAD PARTIALLY STRANGLED HIM
2691-156745-0020 NOTWITHSTANDING THESE PLANS FOR OUR WELL BEING UNACCOUNTABLE DELAYS FOLLOWED MAKING OUR SITUATION DAILY MORE TRYING
2691-156745-0021 THEY HAD NOT FULLY RECOVERED FROM THE EFFECTS OF THEIR LONG PRIVATIONS AND PHYSICAL SUFFERINGS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE LOSS OF PARENTS AND MEANS OF SUPPORT PLACED UPON THEM RESPONSIBILITIES GREATER THAN THEY COULD CARRY
2691-156745-0023 THEY HAD NO WAY OF COMMUNICATING WITH OUR FRIENDS IN EASTERN STATES AND THE WOMEN AT THE FORT COULD ILL AFFORD TO PROVIDE LONGER FOR US SINCE THEIR BREAD WINNERS WERE STILL WITH FREMONT AND THEIR OWN SUPPLIES WERE LIMITED
2691-156745-0024 FINALLY MY TWO ELDEST SISTERS WERE GIVEN EMPLOYMENT BY DIFFERENT FAMILIES IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD WHICH THEY SHARED WITH US BUT IT WAS OFTEN INSUFFICIENT AND WE LITTLE ONES DRIFTED ALONG FORLORNLY SOMETIMES HOME
2691-156745-0026 WE THREE WERE PLAYING NEAR IT WHEN A JOYOUS INDIAN GIRL WITH A BUNDLE OF CLOTHES ON HER HEAD RAN DOWN THE BANK TO THE WATER'S EDGE WE FOLLOWING
2691-156745-0027 MERRILY UP AND DOWN IN THE CLEAR WATER SHE LATHERED THEM WITH A FRESHLY GATHERED SOAP ROOT AND CLEANSED THEM ACCORDING TO THE WAYS OF THE SPANISH MISSION TEACHERS AS SHE TIED THE WET GARMENTS IN A BUNDLE AND TURNED TO CARRY THEM TO THE DRYING GROUND FRANCES
2691-156745-0029 SAW THE POPPIES DRIFT JUST BEYOND HER FINGER TIPS SAW HER LEAN A LITTLE FARTHER THEN SLIP HEAD FIRST INTO THE DEEP WATER SUCH SHRIEKS AS TERRIFIED CHILDREN GIVE BROUGHT THE INDIAN GIRL QUICKLY TO OUR AID LIKE A FLASH
2691-156745-0030 SHE TOSSED THE BUNDLE FROM HER HEAD SPRANG INTO THE WATER SNATCHED FRANCES AS SHE ROSE TO THE SURFACE AND RESTORED HER TO US WITHOUT A WORD BEFORE WE HAD RECOVERED SUFFICIENTLY TO SPEAK SHE WAS GONE
2691-156745-0032 WE WERE TOO YOUNG TO KEEP TRACK OF TIME BY CALENDAR BUT COUNTED IT BY HAPPENINGS SOME WERE MARKED WITH TEARS SOME WITH SMILES AND SOME STOLE UNAWARES UPON US JUST AS ON THAT BRIGHT JUNE EVENING
2691-156745-0033 WHEN WE DID NOT FIND OUR SISTERS AND AIMLESSLY FOLLOWED OTHERS TO THE LITTLE SHOP WHERE A FRIENDLY APPEARING ELDERLY MAN WAS CUTTING SLICES OF MEAT AND HANDING THEM TO CUSTOMERS
2691-156745-0035 AND SAID THAT WE SHOULD SLEEP AT HER HOUSE THAT NIGHT AND SEE OUR SISTERS IN THE MORNING SHE ALSO GAVE US PERMISSION TO COOK OUR PIECES OF LIVER OVER HER BED OF LIVE COALS FRANCES OFFERED TO COOK THEM ALL ON HER STICK BUT
2691-156745-0036 I BEING THE SMALLEST CHILD WAS GIVEN THE SHORTEST STICK AND ALLOWED TO STAND NEAREST THE FIRE SOON THE THREE SLICES WERE SIZZLING AND BROWNING FROM THE ENDS OF THREE WILLOW RODS AND SMELLED SO GOOD THAT WE COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THEM TO BE DONE
2691-156745-0038 SOME ONE POINTED TO HIM WHO SAT BESIDE OUR ELDEST SISTER AND GAYLY SAID LOOK AT YOUR NEW BROTHER ANOTHER ASKED
2691-156745-0039 TEARS CAME ALSO TO THE CHILD WIFE'S EYES AS SHE CLASPED HER ARMS ABOUT US SOOTHINGLY ASSURING US THAT SHE WAS STILL OUR SISTER AND WOULD CARE FOR US NEVERTHELESS
2691-156745-0041 AND SOME IN THEIR EAGERNESS FORGOT TO ROLL DOWN THEIR SLEEVES BEFORE THEY BEGAN TO TALK ONE TRIUMPHANTLY REPEATED TO EACH NEWCOMER THE MOTHERLY ADVICE WHICH SHE GAVE THE YOUNG COUPLE WHEN SHE FIRST
2691-156745-0042 NOTICED HIS AFFECTION FOR THAT SORROWING GIRL WHO IS TOO PRETTY TO BE IN THIS NEW COUNTRY WITHOUT A PROTECTOR THEY ALSO RECALLED HOW PERRY MC COON'S LAUNCH HAD BROUGHT SUPPLIES UP THE RIVER FOR THE SECOND RELIEF TO TAKE OVER THE MOUNTAINS
2691-156745-0044 WOULD SHE TAKE US THREE TO LIVE WITH HER ON THAT CATTLE RANCH TWENTY FIVE MILES BY BRIDLE TRAIL FROM THE FORT
2691-156750-0000 WHILE THE SETTLERS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE CONTENTEDLY AT WORK DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY THE ASTOUNDING CRY GOLD DISCOVERED CAME THROUGH THE VALLEY LIKE A BLIGHT STOPPING EVERY INDUSTRY IN ITS WAKE
2691-156750-0002 WHO HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY PRIVATELY TWO WEEKS EARLIER AND HAD JUST RETURNED IN A STATE OF GREAT ENTHUSIASM DECLARING THAT GOLD IN DUST GRAINS AND CHUNKS HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AT COLOMA NOT MORE THAN A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM SUTTER'S FORT
2691-156750-0003 HOW SOON CAN WE GET THERE BECAME THE ALL ABSORBING PROBLEM OF EAGER LISTENERS THE ONLY HOTEL KEEPER IN THE TOWN SOLD HIS KETTLES AND PANS CLOSED HIS HOUSE AND DEPARTED
2691-156750-0005 WITH THE LONG HOPED FOR REPORT OF THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY OF PEACE AND GENERAL MASON'S PROCLAMATION OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCING IT THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH MEN LEFT IN THE VALLEY OUTSIDE OF THE BARRACKS TO GIVE A DECENT ROUND OF CHEERS FOR THE BLESSING OF PEACE
2691-156750-0006 GRANDPA BROUGHT THE NEWS HOME CALIFORNIA IS OURS THERE WILL BE NO MORE WAR NO MORE TROUBLE AND NO MORE NEED OF SOLDIERS YET THE WOMEN FELT THAT THEIR BATTLES AND TRIALS HAD JUST BEGUN
2691-156750-0008 THEY WENT NOT WITH CHEERING WORDS ONLY BUT WITH SOMETHING IN STORE FOR THE EMPTY CUPBOARDS
2691-156750-0009 GRANDMA WAS IN SUCH DEMAND THAT SHE HAD LITTLE TIME TO REST FOR THERE WAS NOT A DOCTOR NOR A MEDICINE SHOP IN THE VALLEY AND HER PARCELS OF HERBS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR USES HAD TO SERVE FOR BOTH NIGHTS SHE SET HER SHOES HANDY
2691-156750-0011 AND SHE WOULD BID US STAY A WHILE AT DIFFERENT HOUSES WHERE WE COULD BE HELPFUL BUT TO BE SURE AND BRING CAREFUL REPORTS FROM EACH HOME WE ENTERED UNDER SUCH TRAINING WE LEARNED MUCH ABOUT DISEASES AND THE CARE OF THE SUFFERING ANON
2691-156750-0012 WE WOULD FIND IN THE PLAIN WOODEN CRADLE A DAINTY BUNDLE OF SWEETNESS ALL DONE UP IN WHITE
2691-156750-0014 FOR SHE KNEW THAT WE WERE NIMBLER FOOTED WHEN SHE STARTED US OFF IN HAPPY MOOD EACH COW WORE A BELL OF DIFFERENT TONE AND KNEW HER OWN NAME YET IT WAS NOT AN EASY TASK EVEN IN PLEASANT WEATHER TO COLLECT THE VARIOUS STRINGS AND GET THEM HOME ON TIME
2691-156750-0015 THEY MIXED AND FED WITH NEIGHBORS CATTLE ON THE RANGE AND HID THEMSELVES BEHIND CLUMPS OF TREES AND OTHER CONVENIENT OBSTRUCTIONS OFTEN GRANDMA WOULD GET HER STRING IN BY THE MAIN TRAIL AND HAVE THEM MILKED
2691-156750-0017 BUT WE WERE NOT MUCH AFRAID WHEN IT WAS LIGHT ENOUGH SO THAT IMAGINATION COULD NOT PICTURE THEM CREEPING STEALTHILY BEHIND US OUR GALLANT COMPANY C OFFICERED BY CAPTAIN BARTLETT AND LIEUTENANTS STONEMAN AND STONE
2691-156750-0018 TO THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND WHEN CAPTAIN JOE HOOKER BROUGHT HIM OUT TO VISIT GRANDMA'S DAIRY SHE TOO WAS GREATLY PLEASED BY HIS SOLDIERLY BEARING AFTER HE MENTIONED THAT HE HAD HEARD OF HER INTEREST IN THE COMPANY WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED AWAY

2691-156750-0029 I WAS SATISFIED JUST TO LOOK AT THEM AND HEAR THEM SPEAK AT THE CLOSE OF OUR VISIT WITH A KNOWING LOOK SHE TOOK US TO SEE WHAT AUNT LUCY HAD BAKED THE GENERAL AND SHE HAD RECENTLY COME TO PAY A LAST VISIT TO A SICK OFFICER
2691-156750-0030 SOLDIERS DUG HIS GRAVE ON THE HILLSIDE NORTH OF TOWN AND WORD CAME FROM ARMY HEADQUARTERS THAT HE WOULD BE BURIED ON THE MORROW AT MIDDAY WITH MILITARY HONORS GEORGIA AND I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT MILITARY HONORS WERE

2691-156750-0033 ONLY SOLDIERS STOOD CLOSE AROUND THE GRAVE AND HEARD WHAT WAS READ BY THE OFFICER WHO STOOD AT ITS HEAD WITH AN OPEN BOOK IN ONE HAND AND A DRAWN SWORD IN THE OTHER
2691-156755-0001 CAPTAIN FRISBIE SPENT MUCH TIME IN SONOMA AFTER COMPANY H WAS DISBANDED AND OBSERVING ONES REMARKED THAT THE ATTRACTION WAS MISS FANNIE VALLEJO YET NOT UNTIL EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE DID THE GENERAL CONSENT TO PART WITH HIS FIRST BORN DAUGHTER
2691-156755-0002 SHE ANTICIPATED THE COMING EVENT WITH INTEREST AND PLEASURE BECAUSE THE PROLONGED AND BRILLIANT FESTIVITIES WOULD AFFORD HER AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY HER FANCY AND TALENT IN BUTTER MODELLING FOR THE WORK SHE DID NOT CHARGE
2691-156755-0004 SHE TALKED AND MODELLED AND WE LISTENING WATCHED THE FASCINATING PROCESS SAW HER TAKE THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE FASHION A DUCK WITH DUCKLINGS ON A POND A LAMB CURLED UP ASLEEP
2691-156755-0005 AND A COUCHED LION WITH SHAGGY HEAD RESTING UPON HIS FORE PAWS WE WATCHED HER PRESS BEADS OF PROPER SIZE AND COLOR INTO THE EYE SOCKETS SKILFULLY FINISH THE BASE UPON WHICH EACH FIGURE LAY
2691-156755-0007 THEN USE A DIFFERENT MESH TO PRODUCE THE STRANDS FOR THE LION'S MANE AND THE TUFT FOR THE END OF HIS TAIL IN EXUBERANT DELIGHT WE EXCLAIMED OH GRANDMA HOW DID YOU LEARN TO MAKE SUCH WONDERFUL THINGS
2691-156755-0008 I DID NOT LEARN IT IS A GIFT SHE REPLIED THEN SHE SPOKE OF HER MODELLING IN CHILDHOOD AND HER SUBSEQUENT MASTERPIECE WHICH HAD WON THE COMMENDATION OF NAPOLEON AND EMPRESS JOSEPHINE AT THAT AUSPICIOUS TIME SHE WAS BUT EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE
2691-156755-0010 AND EMPRESS WOULD ARRIVE IN THAT TOWN AND DINE AT THE TAVERN THEN THE EXCITEMENT AND ENTHUSIASTIC PREPARATIONS WHICH FOLLOWED
2691-156755-0011 AND WHAT A CENTREPIECE IT WAS IT REQUIRED THE CAREFUL HANDLING OF NO LESS THAN THREE PERSONS TO GET IT IN PLACE ON THE TABLE WHERE THE EMPEROR MIGHT SEE AT A GLANCE THE GROUPS OF FIGURES ALONG THE SPLENDID HIGHWAY
2691-156755-0013 SHE GAVE THE QUICK CALL WHICH BROUGHT THE FRAU WIRTHIN TO THE SCENE OF CONFUSION WHERE IN MUTE AGONY SHE LOOKED FROM SERVANT TO SERVANT UNTIL WITH HANDS CLASPED AND EYES FULL OF TEARS SHE IMPLORED MARIE
2691-156755-0014 TAKE THE HIGHER PLACE FOR THE DAY AND WITH GOD'S HELP MAKE NO MISTAKE THEN SHE WENT ON TO SAY THAT WHILE THE DINNER WAS BEING SERVED THE EMPEROR ADMIRED THE BUTTER PIECE AND ON HEARING THAT IT WAS THE WORK OF A YOUNG MAIDSERVANT IN THE HOUSE
2691-156755-0016 THE GREAT EMPEROR ASKS TO SEE THEE AND THOU MUST COME SHE TOLD HOW POOR RED FACED BEWILDERED MARIE DROPPED HER LADLE AND STARED AT THE SPEAKER
2691-156755-0017 THEN ROLLED DOWN HER SLEEVES WHILE THE FRAU WIRTHIN TIED HER OWN BEST WHITE APRON AROUND HER WAIST AT THE SAME TIME INSTRUCTING HER IN THE MANNER IN WHICH SHE MUST HOLD HER DRESS AT THE SIDES BETWEEN THUMB AND FOREFINGER AND SPREAD THE SKIRT WIDE
2691-156755-0019 THE EMPEROR AND THE EMPRESS SHE NOW FINISHED HER MODELLING WITH A DAINTY CENTREPIECE FOR THE BRIDE'S TABLE AND LET ME GO WITH HER WHEN SHE CARRIED IT TO THE VALLEJO MANSION IT GAVE GREAT SATISFACTION AND WHILE THE FAMILY AND GUESTS WERE ADMIRING IT

2691-156755-0022 AND A CANOPY OF LACE LIKE A FLEECY CLOUD HOVERED OVER THEM THE BED WAS WHITE BUT THE PILLOWS WERE COVERED WITH PINK SILK AND ENCASED IN SLIPS OF LINEN LAWN EXQUISITE WITH RARE NEEDLEWORK
2691-156755-0023 I TOUCHED IT BEFORE I LEFT THE ROOM WONDERING WHAT THE LITTLE GIRL DREAMED IN THAT BEAUTIFUL BED AND ON THE WAY HOME GRANDMA AND I DISCUSSED ALL THESE THINGS
2691-156755-0025 THESE YOUNG LADIES WERE RELATED TO THE VALLEJOS AND ALSO LIVED IN LARGE HOUSES FACING THE PLAZA AND WERE ALWAYS KIND TO GEORGIA AND ME IN FACT SOME OF MY SWEETEST MEMORIES OF SONOMA ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THREE SPANISH HOMES
2691-156755-0026 THEIR PEOPLE NEVER ASKED UNFEELING QUESTIONS NOR REPEATED HARROWING TALES AND I DID NOT LEARN UNTIL I WAS GROWN THAT THEY HAD BEEN AMONG THE LARGE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE FUND FOR THE RELIEF OF OUR PARTY
2691-156755-0028 I HAVE DONE MY BEST WITH THE MEDICINES AT HAND THE ONLY THING THAT REMAINS TO BE TRIED IS A TEA STEEPED FROM THE NETTLE ROOT THAT MAY GIVE RELIEF AS SOON AS WE COULD GET READY AFTER THE DOCTOR UTTERED THOSE WORDS GEORGIA AND I EQUIPPED WITH HOE
2691-156755-0029 WHILE I CUT THEM OFF AND HOED UP THE ROOTS THE PLANTS TOWERED LUXURIANTLY ABOVE OUR HEADS MAKING THE TASK EXTREMELY PAINFUL
2691-156755-0031 THE ONE IN FRONT STAGGERING AND HIS SQUAW BEHIND MAKING FRANTIC MOTIONS TO US TO HURRY OVER THE SNAKE FENCE NEAR BY THIS WE DID AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE AND SUCCEEDED NONE TOO SOON FOR AS WE REACHED THE GROUND ON THE SAFE SIDE HE STOPPED US
2691-156755-0032 AND ANGRILY DEMANDED THE CONTENTS OF OUR BASKET WE OPENED IT AND WHEN HE SAW WHAT IT CONTAINED HE STAMPED HIS WABBLING FOOT AND MOTIONED US TO BE OFF WE OBEYED WITH ALACRITY FOR IT WAS OUR FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH A DRUNKEN INDIAN
2691-156755-0034 AFTER THE LAWYER WENT AWAY GRANDMA TOLD US THAT JAKIE HAD WILLED US EACH FIFTY DOLLARS IN GOLD AND THE REST OF HIS PROPERTY TO GRANDPA AND HERSELF A FEW WEEKS LATER WHEN THE SAP CEASED FLOWING TO THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES AND THE YELLOW LEAVES WERE FALLING
2691-156755-0035 GRANDPA HAD THE GRAVE ENCLOSED WITH A WHITE PALING AND WE CHILDREN PLANTED CASTILIAN ROSE BUSHES AT THE HEAD AND FOOT OF THE MOUND AND CARRIED WATER TO THEM FROM THE HOUSE AND IN TIME THEIR BRANCHES MET AND THE GRAVE WAS A BED OF FRAGRANT BLOSSOMS
2764-36616-0000 WHICH WAS THE BIG NEWS OF THE DAY AND HOW COULD I NOT HAVE BEEN
2764-36616-0001 THIS MYSTERY PUZZLED ME FINDING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM ANY VIEWS I DRIFTED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER SOMETHING WAS OUT THERE THAT MUCH WAS CERTAIN AND ANY DOUBTING THOMAS WAS INVITED TO PLACE HIS FINGER ON THE SCOTIA'S WOUND WHEN I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK
2764-36616-0003 IT COULDN'T STAND UP TO INQUIRIES CONDUCTED IN BOTH THE NEW WORLD AND THE OLD THAT A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL HAD SUCH A MECHANISM AT HIS DISPOSAL WAS LESS THAN PROBABLE WHERE AND WHEN HAD HE BUILT IT AND HOW COULD HE HAVE BUILT IT IN SECRET
2764-36616-0004 ONLY SOME GOVERNMENT COULD OWN SUCH AN ENGINE OF DESTRUCTION AND IN THESE DISASTER FILLED TIMES WHEN MEN TAX THEIR INGENUITY TO BUILD INCREASINGLY POWERFUL AGGRESSIVE WEAPONS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT UNKNOWN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD SOME NATION COULD HAVE BEEN TESTING SUCH A FEARSOME MACHINE
2764-36616-0006 SINCE THE PUBLIC INTEREST WAS AT STAKE AND TRANSOCEANIC TRAVEL WAS SUFFERING
2764-36616-0007 BESIDES HOW COULD THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS UNDERWATER BOAT HAVE ESCAPED PUBLIC NOTICE KEEPING A SECRET UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE DIFFICULT ENOUGH FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AND CERTAINLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A NATION WHOSE EVERY MOVE IS UNDER CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE BY RIVAL POWERS
2764-36616-0009 DESPITE THE ENDLESS WITTICISMS HEAPED ON IT BY THE POPULAR PRESS
2764-36616-0010 AFTER I ARRIVED IN NEW YORK SEVERAL PEOPLE DID ME THE HONOR OF CONSULTING ME ON THE PHENOMENON IN QUESTION IN FRANCE I HAD PUBLISHED A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ENTITLED THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS WELL RECEIVED IN SCHOLARLY CIRCLES
2764-36616-0012 I CONFINED MYSELF TO A FLAT NO COMMENT BUT SOON PINNED TO THE WALL I HAD TO EXPLAIN MYSELF STRAIGHT OUT AND IN THIS VEIN THE HONORABLE PIERRE ARONNAX PROFESSOR AT THE PARIS MUSEUM WAS SUMMONED BY THE NEW YORK HERALD TO FORMULATE HIS VIEWS NO MATTER WHAT
2764-36616-0013 I COMPLIED SINCE I COULD NO LONGER HOLD MY TONGUE I LET IT WAG I DISCUSSED THE QUESTION IN ITS EVERY ASPECT BOTH POLITICAL AND SCIENTIFIC AND THIS IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE WELL PADDED ARTICLE I PUBLISHED IN THE ISSUE OF APRIL THIRTIETH
2764-36616-0015 THE DEEPEST PARTS OF THE OCEAN ARE TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO US NO SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REACH THEM WHAT GOES ON IN THOSE DISTANT DEPTHS WHAT CREATURES INHABIT OR COULD INHABIT THOSE REGIONS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN MILES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER
2764-36616-0016 WHAT IS THE CONSTITUTION OF THESE ANIMALS IT'S ALMOST BEYOND CONJECTURE HOWEVER THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM SUBMITTED TO ME CAN TAKE THE FORM OF A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO ALTERNATIVES EITHER WE KNOW EVERY VARIETY OF CREATURE POPULATING OUR PLANET OR WE DO NOT
2764-36616-0018 THAT INHABIT STRATA BEYOND THE REACH OF OUR SOUNDINGS AND WHICH SOME DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER AN URGE OR A WHIM IF YOU PREFER CAN BRING TO THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE OCEAN FOR LONG INTERVALS IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE DO KNOW EVERY LIVING SPECIES
2764-36616-0019 WE MUST LOOK FOR THE ANIMAL IN QUESTION AMONG THOSE MARINE CREATURES ALREADY CATALOGED AND IN THIS EVENT I WOULD BE INCLINED TO ACCEPT THE EXISTENCE OF A GIANT NARWHALE
2764-36616-0021 THE INSTRUMENT NEEDED TO PERFORATE THE SCOTIA AND THE POWER TO PIERCE A STEAMER'S HULL IN ESSENCE THE NARWHALE IS ARMED WITH A SORT OF IVORY SWORD OR LANCE AS CERTAIN NATURALISTS HAVE EXPRESSED IT IT'S A KING SIZED TOOTH AS HARD AS STEEL
2764-36616-0022 WHICH THE NARWHALE ATTACKS WITH INVARIABLE SUCCESS OTHERS HAVE BEEN WRENCHED NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
2764-36616-0024 LAUNCH IT AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES PER HOUR MULTIPLY ITS MASS TIMES ITS VELOCITY AND YOU GET JUST THE COLLISION WE NEED TO CAUSE THE SPECIFIED CATASTROPHE SO UNTIL INFORMATION BECOMES MORE ABUNDANT I PLUMP FOR A SEA UNICORN OF COLOSSAL DIMENSIONS
2764-36616-0025 NO LONGER ARMED WITH A MERE LANCE BUT WITH AN ACTUAL SPUR LIKE IRONCLAD FRIGATES OR THOSE WARSHIPS CALLED RAMS WHOSE MASS AND MOTOR POWER IT WOULD POSSESS SIMULTANEOUSLY THIS INEXPLICABLE PHENOMENON IS THUS EXPLAINED AWAY
2764-36616-0027 I HAD LEFT MYSELF A LOOPHOLE YET DEEP DOWN I HAD ACCEPTED THE EXISTENCE OF THE MONSTER MY ARTICLE WAS HOTLY DEBATED CAUSING A FINE OLD UPROAR
2764-36616-0028 MOREOVER THE SOLUTION IT PROPOSED ALLOWED FOR FREE PLAY OF THE IMAGINATION THE HUMAN MIND ENJOYS IMPRESSIVE VISIONS OF UNEARTHLY CREATURES NOW THEN THE SEA IS PRECISELY THEIR BEST MEDIUM
2764-36616-0030 CONTINUOUS ALTERATION COULDN'T THE HEART OF THE OCEAN HIDE THE LAST REMAINING VARIETIES OF THESE TITANIC SPECIES FOR WHOM YEARS ARE CENTURIES AND CENTURIES MILLENNIA BUT I MUSTN'T LET THESE FANTASIES RUN AWAY WITH ME
2764-36616-0031 ENOUGH OF THESE FAIRY TALES THAT TIME HAS CHANGED FOR ME INTO HARSH REALITIES I REPEAT OPINION HAD CRYSTALLIZED AS TO THE NATURE OF THIS PHENOMENON AND THE PUBLIC ACCEPTED WITHOUT ARGUMENT THE EXISTENCE OF A PRODIGIOUS CREATURE THAT HAD NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FABLED SEA SERPENT
2764-36616-0033 THE SHIPPING AND MERCANTILE GAZETTE THE LLOYD'S LIST FRANCE'S PACKETBOAT AND MARITIME AND COLONIAL REVIEW ALL THE RAGS DEVOTED TO INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO THREATENED TO RAISE THEIR PREMIUM RATES WERE UNANIMOUS ON THIS POINT
2764-36616-0034 THE NAVAL ARSENALS WERE UNLOCKED FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT WHO PRESSED ENERGETICALLY FORWARD WITH THE ARMING OF HIS FRIGATE BUT AS IT ALWAYS HAPPENS JUST WHEN A DECISION HAD BEEN MADE TO CHASE THE MONSTER THE MONSTER PUT IN NO FURTHER APPEARANCES
2764-36616-0036 ACCORDINGLY THE WAGS CLAIMED THAT THIS SLIPPERY RASCAL HAD WAYLAID SOME PASSING TELEGRAM AND WAS MAKING THE MOST OF IT SO THE FRIGATE WAS EQUIPPED FOR A FAR OFF VOYAGE AND ARMED WITH FEARSOME FISHING GEAR BUT NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO STEER IT AND IMPATIENCE GREW UNTIL ON JUNE SECOND
2764-36616-0037 WORD CAME THAT THE TAMPICO A STEAMER ON THE SAN FRANCISCO LINE SAILING FROM CALIFORNIA TO SHANGHAI HAD SIGHTED THE ANIMAL AGAIN THREE WEEKS BEFORE IN THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC THIS NEWS CAUSED INTENSE EXCITEMENT
2764-36617-0000 CHAPTER THREE AS MASTER WISHES THREE SECONDS BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF J B HOBSON'S LETTER
2764-36617-0001 I UNDERSTOOD AT LAST THAT MY TRUE VOCATION MY SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE WAS TO HUNT DOWN THIS DISTURBING MONSTER AND RID THE WORLD OF IT EVEN SO I HAD JUST RETURNED FROM AN ARDUOUS JOURNEY EXHAUSTED AND BADLY NEEDING A REST
2764-36617-0003 I ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT'S OFFER BESIDES I MUSED ALL ROADS LEAD HOME TO EUROPE AND OUR UNICORN MAY BE GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO TAKE ME TOWARD THE COAST OF FRANCE THAT FINE ANIMAL MAY EVEN LET ITSELF BE CAPTURED IN EUROPEAN SEAS AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ME
2764-36617-0004 CONSEIL I CALLED IN AN IMPATIENT VOICE CONSEIL WAS MY MANSERVANT A DEVOTED LAD WHO WENT WITH ME ON ALL MY JOURNEYS A GALLANT FLEMISH BOY WHOM I GENUINELY LIKED AND WHO RETURNED THE COMPLIMENT A BORN STOIC PUNCTILIOUS ON PRINCIPLE
2764-36617-0006 FROM RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH SCIENTISTS IN OUR LITTLE UNIVERSE BY THE BOTANICAL GARDENS THE BOY HAD COME TO KNOW A THING OR TWO IN CONSEIL I HAD A SEASONED SPECIALIST IN BIOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION AN ENTHUSIAST WHO COULD RUN WITH ACROBATIC AGILITY
2764-36617-0007 UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE LADDER OF BRANCHES GROUPS CLASSES SUBCLASSES ORDERS FAMILIES GENERA SUBGENERA SPECIES AND VARIETIES BUT THERE HIS SCIENCE CAME TO A HALT CLASSIFYING WAS EVERYTHING TO HIM SO HE KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2764-36617-0009 FOR THE PAST TEN YEARS CONSEIL HAD GONE WITH ME WHEREVER SCIENCE BECKONED NOT ONCE DID HE COMMENT ON THE LENGTH OR THE HARDSHIPS OF A JOURNEY NEVER DID HE OBJECT TO BUCKLING UP HIS SUITCASE FOR ANY COUNTRY WHATEVER CHINA OR THE CONGO
2764-36617-0010 NO MATTER HOW FAR OFF IT WAS HE WENT HERE THERE AND EVERYWHERE IN PERFECT CONTENTMENT MOREOVER HE ENJOYED EXCELLENT HEALTH THAT DEFIED ALL AILMENTS OWNED SOLID MUSCLES BUT HADN'T A NERVE IN HIM NOT A SIGN OF NERVES THE MENTAL TYPE I MEAN
2764-36617-0012 AND HE ONLY ADDRESSED ME IN THE THIRD PERSON TO THE POINT WHERE IT GOT TIRESOME CONSEIL I REPEATED WHILE FEVERISHLY BEGINNING MY PREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE TO BE SURE I HAD CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEVOTED LAD
2764-36617-0013 THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO STOP AND THINK EVEN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST EMOTIONLESS MAN
2764-36617-0015 YES MY BOY GET MY THINGS READY GET YOURS READY WE'RE DEPARTING IN TWO HOURS AS MASTER WISHES CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY WE HAVEN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE PACK AS MUCH INTO MY TRUNK AS YOU CAN MY TRAVELING KIT MY SUITS SHIRTS AND SOCKS
2764-36617-0016 DON'T BOTHER COUNTING JUST SQUEEZE IT ALL IN AND HURRY WHAT ABOUT MASTER'S COLLECTIONS CONSEIL VENTURED TO OBSERVE WE'LL DEAL WITH THEM LATER WHAT THE ARCHAEOTHERIUM HYRACOTHERIUM OREODONTS CHEIROPOTAMUS AND MASTER'S OTHER FOSSIL SKELETONS
2764-36617-0018 AS MASTER THINKS BEST CONSEIL REPLIED PLACIDLY YOU SEE MY FRIEND IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE MONSTER THE NOTORIOUS NARWHALE WE'RE GOING TO RID THE SEAS OF IT THE AUTHOR OF A TWO VOLUME WORK IN QUARTO ON THE MYSTERIES OF THE GREAT OCEAN DEPTHS
2764-36617-0019 IT'S A GLORIOUS MISSION BUT ALSO A DANGEROUS ONE
2764-36617-0021 AS MASTER WISHES A QUARTER OF AN HOUR LATER OUR TRUNKS WERE READY CONSEIL DID THEM IN A FLASH AND I WAS SURE THE LAD HADN'T MISSED A THING BECAUSE HE CLASSIFIED SHIRTS AND SUITS AS EXPERTLY AS BIRDS AND MAMMALS
2764-36617-0022 THE HOTEL ELEVATOR DROPPED US OFF IN THE MAIN VESTIBULE ON THE MEZZANINE I WENT DOWN A SHORT STAIR LEADING TO THE GROUND FLOOR
2764-36617-0024 FOR A FARE OF TWENTY FRANCS THE VEHICLE WENT DOWN BROADWAY TO UNION SQUARE
2764-36617-0025 THAT GREAT NEW YORK ANNEX LOCATED ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE EAST RIVER AND IN A FEW MINUTES WE ARRIVED AT THE WHARF NEXT TO WHICH THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS VOMITING TORRENTS OF BLACK SMOKE FROM ITS TWO FUNNELS OUR BAGGAGE WAS IMMEDIATELY CARRIED TO THE DECK OF THE FRIGATE
2764-36617-0027 THE SAME I REPLIED COMMANDER FARRAGUT IN PERSON WELCOME ABOARD PROFESSOR YOUR CABIN IS WAITING FOR YOU I BOWED AND LETTING THE COMMANDER ATTEND TO GETTING UNDER WAY I WAS TAKEN TO THE CABIN THAT HAD BEEN SET ASIDE FOR ME
2764-36617-0028 THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN REACHED AN AVERAGE SPEED OF EIGHTEEN POINT THREE MILES PER HOUR A CONSIDERABLE SPEED BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH TO COPE WITH OUR GIGANTIC CETACEAN THE FRIGATE'S INTERIOR ACCOMMODATIONS COMPLEMENTED ITS NAUTICAL VIRTUES I WAS WELL SATISFIED WITH MY CABIN
2764-36617-0030 JUST THEN COMMANDER FARRAGUT WAS GIVING ORDERS TO CAST OFF THE LAST MOORINGS HOLDING THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO ITS BROOKLYN PIER AND SO IF I'D BEEN DELAYED BY A QUARTER OF AN HOUR OR EVEN LESS
2764-36617-0031 THE FRIGATE WOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT ME AND I WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT ON THIS UNEARTHLY EXTRAORDINARY AND INCONCEIVABLE EXPEDITION WHOSE TRUE STORY MIGHT WELL MEET WITH SOME SKEPTICISM BUT COMMANDER FARRAGUT DIDN'T WANT TO WASTE A SINGLE DAY
2764-36617-0033 THE BLADES OF THE PROPELLER CHURNED THE WAVES WITH INCREASING SPEED AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN MOVED OUT MAJESTICALLY AMID A SPECTATOR LADEN ESCORT OF SOME ONE HUNDRED FERRIES AND TENDERS AUTHOR'S NOTE TENDERS ARE SMALL STEAMBOATS THAT ASSIST THE BIG LINERS
2764-36617-0034 THE WHARVES OF BROOKLYN AND EVERY PART OF NEW YORK BORDERING THE EAST RIVER WERE CROWDED WITH CURIOSITY SEEKERS DEPARTING FROM FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THROATS THREE CHEERS BURST FORTH IN SUCCESSION
2764-36617-0036 THE WONDERFUL RIGHT BANK OF THIS RIVER ALL LOADED DOWN WITH COUNTRY HOMES AND PASSED BY THE FORTS TO SALUTES FROM THEIR BIGGEST CANNONS
2764-36617-0037 WHOSE THIRTY NINE STARS GLEAMED FROM THE GAFF OF THE MIZZEN SAIL
2764-36619-0000 CHAPTER FIVE AT RANDOM FOR SOME WHILE THE VOYAGE OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS MARKED BY NO INCIDENT BUT ONE CIRCUMSTANCE AROSE THAT DISPLAYED NED LAND'S MARVELOUS SKILLS AND SHOWED JUST HOW MUCH CONFIDENCE WE COULD PLACE IN HIM
2764-36619-0001 OFF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS ON JUNE THIRTIETH THE FRIGATE CAME IN CONTACT WITH A FLEET OF AMERICAN WHALERS AND WE LEARNED THAT THEY HADN'T SEEN THE NARWHALE BUT ONE OF THEM THE CAPTAIN OF THE MONROE
2764-36619-0003 ASSUREDLY IF THE MONSTER EVER HAD TO DEAL WITH NED LAND'S HARPOON I WOULDN'T BET ON THE MONSTER THE FRIGATE SAILED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA WITH PRODIGIOUS SPEED BY JULY THIRD WE WERE AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN ABREAST OF CABO DE LAS VIRGENES
2764-36619-0004 AND MANEUVERED INSTEAD TO DOUBLE CAPE HORN THE CREW SIDED WITH HIM UNANIMOUSLY INDEED WERE WE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER THE NARWHALE IN SUCH A CRAMPED STRAIT MANY OF OUR SAILORS SWORE THAT THE MONSTER COULDN'T NEGOTIATE THIS PASSAGEWAY SIMPLY BECAUSE HE'S TOO BIG FOR IT
2764-36619-0006 OUR COURSE WAS SET FOR THE NORTHWEST AND THE NEXT DAY OUR FRIGATE'S PROPELLER FINALLY CHURNED THE WATERS OF THE PACIFIC OPEN YOUR EYES OPEN YOUR EYES REPEATED THE SAILORS OF THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN AND THEY OPENED AMAZINGLY WIDE EYES AND SPYGLASSES
2764-36619-0007 A BIT DAZZLED IT IS TRUE BY THE VISTA OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS DIDN'T REMAIN AT REST FOR AN INSTANT DAY AND NIGHT WE OBSERVED THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN AND THOSE WITH NYCTALOPIC EYES WHOSE ABILITY TO SEE IN THE DARK INCREASED THEIR CHANCES BY FIFTY PERCENT
2764-36619-0009 AND HOW MANY TIMES I SHARED THE EXCITEMENT OF GENERAL STAFF AND CREW WHEN SOME UNPREDICTABLE WHALE LIFTED ITS BLACKISH BACK ABOVE THE WAVES IN AN INSTANT THE FRIGATE'S DECK WOULD BECOME DENSELY POPULATED THE COWLS OVER THE COMPANIONWAYS WOULD VOMIT A TORRENT OF SAILORS AND OFFICERS
2764-36619-0010 WITH PANTING CHESTS AND ANXIOUS EYES WE EACH WOULD OBSERVE THE CETACEAN'S MOVEMENTS I STARED I STARED UNTIL I NEARLY WENT BLIND FROM A WORN OUT RETINA WHILE CONSEIL AS STOIC AS EVER KEPT REPEATING TO ME IN A CALM TONE
2764-36619-0012 OR A COMMON SPERM WHALE THAT SOON DISAPPEARED AMID A CHORUS OF CURSES HOWEVER THE WEATHER HELD GOOD OUR VOYAGE WAS PROCEEDING UNDER THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS BY THEN IT WAS THE BAD SEASON IN THESE SOUTHERNMOST REGIONS
2764-36619-0013 BECAUSE JULY IN THIS ZONE CORRESPONDS TO OUR JANUARY IN EUROPE BUT THE SEA REMAINED SMOOTH AND EASILY VISIBLE OVER A VAST PERIMETER NED LAND STILL KEPT UP THE MOST TENACIOUS SKEPTICISM
2764-36619-0015 AND IF THERE IS SOME ANIMAL WHAT CHANCE WOULD WE HAVE OF SPOTTING IT CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE JUST WANDERING AROUND AT RANDOM PEOPLE SAY THEY'VE SIGHTED THIS SLIPPERY BEAST AGAIN IN THE PACIFIC HIGH SEAS I'M TRULY WILLING TO BELIEVE IT BUT TWO MONTHS HAVE ALREADY GONE BY SINCE THEN
2764-36619-0016 AND JUDGING BY YOUR NARWHALE'S PERSONALITY IT HATES GROWING MOLDY FROM HANGING OUT TOO LONG IN THE SAME WATERWAYS IT'S BLESSED WITH A TERRIFIC GIFT FOR GETTING AROUND NOW PROFESSOR YOU KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I THAT NATURE DOESN'T VIOLATE GOOD SENSE
2764-36619-0018 NO DOUBT OUR BOSUN SAID BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ENOUGH WATER FOR HIM
2764-36619-0019 THEN CUT THE TROPIC OF CANCER AT LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO DEGREES AND HEADED FOR THE SEAS OF CHINA WE WERE FINALLY IN THE AREA OF THE MONSTER'S LATEST ANTICS AND IN ALL HONESTY SHIPBOARD CONDITIONS BECAME LIFE THREATENING HEARTS WERE POUNDING HIDEOUSLY
2764-36619-0021 KEPT US IN A STATE OF IRRITABILITY SO INTENSE THAT A REACTION WAS BOUND TO FOLLOW AND THIS REACTION WASN'T LONG IN COMING FOR THREE MONTHS DURING WHICH EACH DAY SEEMED LIKE A CENTURY THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN PLOWED ALL THE NORTHERLY SEAS OF THE PACIFIC
2764-36619-0022 RACING AFTER WHALES SIGHTED ABRUPTLY VEERING OFF COURSE SWERVING SHARPLY FROM ONE TACK TO ANOTHER STOPPING SUDDENLY PUTTING ON STEAM AND REVERSING ENGINES IN QUICK SUCCESSION AT THE RISK OF STRIPPING ITS GEARS
2764-36619-0024 AND EACH MAN NOW WANTED ONLY TO CATCH UP ON HIS EATING AND SLEEPING TO MAKE UP FOR THE TIME HE HAD SO STUPIDLY SACRIFICED WITH TYPICAL HUMAN FICKLENESS THEY JUMPED FROM ONE EXTREME TO THE OTHER INEVITABLY THE MOST ENTHUSIASTIC SUPPORTERS OF THE UNDERTAKING BECAME ITS MOST ENERGETIC OPPONENTS
2764-36619-0025 THIS REACTION MOUNTED UPWARD FROM THE BOWELS OF THE SHIP FROM THE QUARTERS OF THE BUNKER HANDS TO THE MESSROOM OF THE GENERAL STAFF AND FOR CERTAIN IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR COMMANDER FARRAGUT'S CHARACTERISTIC STUBBORNNESS THE FRIGATE WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE PUT BACK TO THAT CAPE IN THE SOUTH
2764-36619-0027 A REQUEST TO THIS EFFECT WAS PRESENTED TO THE COMMANDER THE COMMANDER STOOD HIS GROUND HIS SAILORS COULDN'T HIDE THEIR DISCONTENT AND THEIR WORK SUFFERED BECAUSE OF IT I'M UNWILLING TO SAY THAT THERE WAS MUTINY ON BOARD
2764-36619-0028 AND THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN WOULD CHART A COURSE TOWARD EUROPEAN SEAS THIS PROMISE WAS GIVEN ON NOVEMBER SECOND IT HAD THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF REVIVING THE CREW'S FAILING SPIRITS THE OCEAN WAS OBSERVED WITH RENEWED CARE
2764-36619-0030 TWO DAYS PASSED THE ABRAHAM LINCOLN STAYED AT HALF STEAM
2764-36619-0031 A THOUSAND METHODS WERE USED TO SPARK ITS INTEREST OR ROUSE IT FROM ITS APATHY ENORMOUS SIDES OF BACON WERE TRAILED IN OUR WAKE TO THE GREAT SATISFACTION I MUST SAY OF ASSORTED SHARKS
2764-36619-0033 BY THEN THE FRIGATE LAY IN LATITUDE THIRTY ONE DEGREES FIFTEEN NORTH AND LONGITUDE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX DEGREES FORTY TWO EAST THE SHORES OF JAPAN WERE LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED MILES TO OUR LEEWARD NIGHT WAS COMING ON EIGHT O'CLOCK HAD JUST STRUCK
2764-36619-0034 HUGE CLOUDS COVERED THE MOON'S DISK THEN IN ITS FIRST QUARTER THE SEA UNDULATED PLACIDLY BENEATH THE FRIGATE'S STEMPOST JUST THEN I WAS IN THE BOW LEANING OVER THE STARBOARD RAIL CONSEIL STATIONED BESIDE ME STARED STRAIGHT AHEAD
2764-36619-0036 THEN ALL TRACES OF LIGHT VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS OBSERVING CONSEIL I DISCOVERED THAT JUST BARELY THE GALLANT LAD HAD FALLEN UNDER THE GENERAL INFLUENCE AT LEAST SO I THOUGHT PERHAPS HIS NERVES WERE TWITCHING WITH CURIOSITY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY
2764-36619-0037 COME ON CONSEIL I TOLD HIM HERE'S YOUR LAST CHANCE TO POCKET THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF MASTER WILL PERMIT MY SAYING SO CONSEIL REPLIED I NEVER EXPECTED TO WIN THAT PRIZE
2764-36619-0039 AND IT WOULD HAVE ATTRACTED EVERY CURIOSITY SEEKER IN TOWN QUITE SO CONSEIL AND WHAT'S MORE
2764-36619-0040 TO BE SURE CONSEIL REPLIED SERENELY I DO THINK THEY'LL HAVE FUN AT MASTER'S EXPENSE AND MUST IT BE SAID IT MUST BE SAID CONSEIL WELL THEN IT WILL SERVE MASTER RIGHT
2817-142371-0000 THE NEXT SATURDAY EVENING THERE WAS MUCH EXCITED DISCUSSION AT THE DONNITHORNE ARMS CONCERNING AN INCIDENT WHICH HAD OCCURRED THAT VERY DAY NO LESS THAN A SECOND APPEARANCE OF THE SMART MAN IN TOP BOOTS
2817-142371-0001 THE PERSONAL WITNESS TO THE STRANGER'S VISIT PRONOUNCED CONTEMPTUOUSLY TO BE NOTHING BETTER THAN A BAILIFF SUCH AS SATCHELL HAD BEEN BEFORE HIM NO ONE HAD THOUGHT OF DENYING MISTER CASSON'S TESTIMONY TO THE FACT THAT HE HAD SEEN THE STRANGER NEVERTHELESS
2817-142371-0003 AND JUST AS I COME UP BY THE BIG ASH TREE I SEE THE MAN TOP BOOTS COMING ALONG ON A BALD FACED HOSS I WISH I MAY NEVER STIR IF I DIDN'T AND I STOOD STILL TILL HE COME UP AND I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR
2817-142371-0004 I SAYS FOR I WANTED TO HEAR THE TURN OF HIS TONGUE AS I MIGHT KNOW WHETHER HE WAS A THIS COUNTRY MAN SO I SAYS GOOD MORNING SIR IT LL OLD HUP FOR THE BARLEY THIS MORNING I THINK THERE'LL BE A BIT GOT HIN IF WE'VE GOOD LUCK
2817-142371-0006 I SHOULD THINK A MAN AS HAS LIVED AMONG THE GENTRY FROM A BY
2817-142371-0007 AYE AYE MAN SAID BARTLE WITH A TONE OF SARCASTIC CONSOLATION YOU TALK THE RIGHT LANGUAGE FOR YOU WHEN MIKE HOLDSWORTH'S GOAT SAYS BA A A IT'S ALL RIGHT IT UD BE UNNATURAL FOR IT TO MAKE ANY OTHER NOISE
2817-142371-0009 AND WISELY FELL BACK ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION WHICH FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED IN A SINGLE EVENING WAS RENEWED IN THE CHURCHYARD BEFORE SERVICE THE NEXT DAY WITH THE FRESH INTEREST CONFERRED ON ALL NEWS WHEN THERE IS A FRESH PERSON TO HEAR IT
2817-142371-0010 AND THAT FRESH HEARER WAS MARTIN POYSER WHO AS HIS WIFE SAID
2817-142371-0012 AS IS A GOING TO TAKE THE CHASE FARM WANTING POYSER TO DO SOMETHING FOR HIM WITHOUT PAY BUT POYSER'S A FOOL IF HE DOES
2817-142371-0013 FOR THE OLD SQUIRE'S VISITS TO HIS TENANTRY WERE RARE AND THOUGH MISSUS POYSER HAD DURING THE LAST TWELVEMONTH RECITED MANY IMAGINARY SPEECHES MEANING EVEN MORE THAN MET THE EAR
2817-142371-0015 IT WAS AS IF YOU WAS A INSECT AND HE WAS GOING TO DAB HIS FINGER NAIL ON YOU HOWEVER SHE SAID YOUR SERVANT SIR AND CURTSIED WITH AN AIR OF PERFECT DEFERENCE AS SHE ADVANCED TOWARDS HIM SHE WAS NOT THE WOMAN TO MISBEHAVE TOWARDS HER BETTERS
2817-142371-0016 AND FLY IN THE FACE OF THE CATECHISM WITHOUT SEVERE PROVOCATION IS YOUR HUSBAND AT HOME MISSUS POYSER YES SIR HE'S ONLY THE RICK YARD I'LL SEND FOR HIM IN A MINUTE IF YOU'LL PLEASE TO GET DOWN AND STEP IN
2817-142371-0018 SAID MISSUS POYSER AS THEY ENTERED THE HOUSE AND THE OLD GENTLEMAN BOWED LOW IN ANSWER TO HETTY'S CURTSY WHILE TOTTY CONSCIOUS OF A PINAFORE STAINED WITH GOOSEBERRY JAM STOOD HIDING HER FACE AGAINST THE CLOCK AND PEEPING ROUND FURTIVELY
2817-142371-0019 WHAT A FINE OLD KITCHEN THIS IS SAID MISTER DONNITHORNE LOOKING ROUND ADMIRINGLY HE ALWAYS SPOKE IN THE SAME DELIBERATE WELL CHISELLED POLITE WAY WHETHER HIS WORDS WERE SUGARY OR VENOMOUS
2817-142371-0021 I SHOULD BE GLAD IF YOU'D LET A BIT O REPAIRS BE DONE TO EM FOR THE BOARDING'S THAT STATE AS WE'RE LIKE TO BE EATEN UP WI RATS AND MICE AND THE CELLAR YOU MAY STAN UP TO YOUR KNEES WATER IN'T IF YOU LIKE TO GO DOWN BUT PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER BELIEVE MY WORDS
2817-142371-0022 NOT YET I MUST SEE YOUR DAIRY
2817-142371-0024 YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF I CAST A COVETOUS EYE ON YOUR CREAM AND BUTTER I DON'T EXPECT THAT MISSUS SATCHELL'S CREAM AND BUTTER WILL BEAR COMPARISON WITH YOURS I CAN'T SAY SIR I'M SURE IT'S SELDOM I SEE OTHER FOLKS'S BUTTER
2817-142371-0025 THOUGH THERE'S SOME ON IT AS ONE'S NO NEED TO SEE THE SMELL'S ENOUGH
2817-142371-0027 I'LL SIT DOWN IN YOUR COMFORTABLE KITCHEN AH POYSER HOW DO YOU DO IN THE MIDST OF BUSINESS I SEE AS USUAL I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT YOUR WIFE'S BEAUTIFUL DAIRY
2817-142371-0028 MISTER POYSER HAD JUST ENTERED IN SHIRT SLEEVES AND OPEN WAISTCOAT WITH A FACE A SHADE REDDER THAN USUAL FROM THE EXERTION OF PITCHING AS HE STOOD RED ROTUND AND RADIANT
2817-142371-0030 I THINK SHE HAS NOT A GOOD METHOD AS YOU HAVE INDEED SIR I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT SAID MISSUS POYSER IN A HARD VOICE ROLLING AND UNROLLING HER KNITTING AND LOOKING ICILY OUT OF THE WINDOW AS SHE CONTINUED TO STAND OPPOSITE THE SQUIRE
2817-142371-0031 POYSER MIGHT SIT DOWN IF HE LIKED SHE THOUGHT SHE WASN'T GOING TO SIT DOWN AS IF SHE'D GIVE IN TO ANY SUCH SMOOTH TONGUED PALAVER MISTER POYSER WHO LOOKED AND FELT THE REVERSE OF ICY DID SIT DOWN IN HIS THREE CORNERED CHAIR
2817-142371-0033 SAID MISTER POYSER WITH A GOOD NATURED BLANKNESS OF IMAGINATION AS TO THE NATURE OF THE ARRANGEMENT IF I'M CALLED UPON TO SPEAK SIR SAID MISSUS POYSER AFTER GLANCING AT HER HUSBAND WITH PITY AT HIS SOFTNESS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ME
2817-142371-0034 NOT BUT WHAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR O ANYBODY RESPECTABLE COMING INTO THE PARISH THERE'S SOME
2817-142371-0036 INDEED SIR IF IT'S ANYTHING T OUR ADVANTAGE
2817-142371-0037 I THINK FOLKS HAVE TO WAIT LONG ENOUGH AFORE IT'S BROUGHT TO EM THE FACT IS POYSER SAID THE SQUIRE IGNORING MISSUS POYSER'S THEORY OF WORLDLY PROSPERITY
2817-142371-0039 THAN CORN LAND MISTER POYSER WAS LEANING FORWARD WITH HIS ELBOWS ON HIS KNEES HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND HIS MOUTH SCREWED UP
2817-142371-0040 HE WAS MUCH TOO ACUTE A MAN NOT TO SEE THROUGH THE WHOLE BUSINESS AND TO FORESEE PERFECTLY WHAT WOULD BE HIS WIFE'S VIEW OF THE SUBJECT BUT HE DISLIKED GIVING UNPLEASANT ANSWERS UNLESS IT WAS ON A POINT OF FARMING PRACTICE
2817-142371-0042 MISSUS POYSER HAD HAD HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND WITH COLD SEVERITY DURING HIS SILENCE BUT NOW SHE TURNED AWAY HER HEAD WITH A TOSS LOOKED ICILY AT THE OPPOSITE ROOF OF THE COW SHED AND SPEARING HER KNITTING TOGETHER WITH THE LOOSE PIN

2817-142371-0046 NO NO MY DEAR MISSUS POYSER CERTAINLY NOT SAID THE SQUIRE STILL CONFIDENT IN HIS OWN POWERS OF PERSUASION YOU MUST NOT OVERWORK YOURSELF
2817-142371-0048 THAT IT WAS NOT IN THIS CASE A PURELY ABSTRACT QUESTION I DARESAY SAID MISSUS POYSER BITTERLY TURNING HER HEAD HALF WAY TOWARDS HER HUSBAND AND LOOKING AT THE VACANT ARM CHAIR I DARESAY IT'S TRUE FOR MEN

2817-142371-0057 EVEN WITHOUT THE FINAL THREAT HER HUSBAND REALLY ALARMED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF THEIR LEAVING THE OLD PLACE WHERE HE HAD BEEN BRED AND BORN FOR HE BELIEVED THE OLD SQUIRE HAD SMALL SPITE ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING
2817-142371-0058 WAS BEGINNING A MILD REMONSTRANCE EXPLANATORY OF THE INCONVENIENCE HE SHOULD FIND IN HAVING TO BUY AND SELL MORE STOCK WITH
2817-142371-0060 SIGN HER SOUL AWAY I'VE A RIGHT TO SPEAK FOR I MAKE ONE QUARTER O THE RENT AND SAVE ANOTHER QUARTER
2817-142371-0062 AS IT'S A MERCY THEY HANNA EAT THE CHILDREN LONG AGO
2817-142371-0064 IF YOU'LL GET A STRANGER TO LEAD SUCH A LIFE HERE AS THAT A MAGGOT MUST BE BORN THE ROTTEN CHEESE TO LIKE IT I RECKON YOU MAY RUN AWAY FROM MY WORDS SIR CONTINUED MISSUS POYSER FOLLOWING THE OLD SQUIRE BEYOND THE DOOR
2817-142371-0065 FOR AFTER THE FIRST MOMENTS OF STUNNED SURPRISE HE HAD GOT UP AND WAVING HIS HAND TOWARDS HER WITH A SMILE HAD WALKED OUT TOWARDS HIS PONY BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO GET AWAY IMMEDIATELY FOR JOHN WAS WALKING THE PONY UP AND DOWN THE YARD
2817-142371-0067 FOR WANT O KNOWING HOW T UNDO THE TACKLE
2817-142371-0068 AS SPEAKS MY MIND THERE'S PLENTY O THE SAME WAY O THINKING THIS PARISH
2817-142371-0070 THERE ARE OCCASIONS ON WHICH TWO SERVANT GIRLS AND A WAGGONER MAY BE A FORMIDABLE AUDIENCE AND AS THE SQUIRE RODE AWAY ON HIS BLACK PONY EVEN THE GIFT OF SHORT SIGHTEDNESS DID NOT PREVENT HIM FROM BEING AWARE THAT MOLLY
2817-142371-0071 AND THE GANDER HISSING AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE PONY'S HEELS CARRIED OUT THE IDEA OF MISSUS POYSER'S SOLO IN AN IMPRESSIVE QUARTET MISSUS POYSER HOWEVER HAD NO SOONER SEEN THE PONY MOVE OFF THAN SHE TURNED ROUND
2817-142371-0073 A LITTLE ALARMED AND UNEASY BUT NOT WITHOUT SOME TRIUMPHANT AMUSEMENT AT HIS WIFE'S OUTBREAK YES I KNOW I'VE DONE IT SAID MISSUS POYSER
2817-142371-0074 THERE'S NO PLEASURE LIVING IF YOU'RE TO BE CORKED UP FOR EVER AND ONLY DRIBBLE YOUR MIND OUT BY THE SLY LIKE A LEAKY BARREL I SHAN'T REPENT SAYING WHAT I THINK
2817-142371-0076 THIS MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH SAID MISTER POYSER AND GOING INTO A STRANGE PARISH WHERE THEE KNOW'ST NOBODY IT'LL BE HARD UPON US BOTH
2817-142371-0077 THERE'S PLENTY O THINGS MAY HAPPEN BETWEEN THIS AND MICHAELMAS TWELVEMONTH THE CAPTAIN MAY BE MASTER AFORE THEM FOR WHAT WE KNOW SAID MISSUS POYSER INCLINED TO TAKE AN UNUSUALLY HOPEFUL VIEW OF AN EMBARRASSMENT WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT BY HER OWN MERIT
2817-142380-0000 WITH TWO BEDS IN IT ONE LAID ON THE FLOOR IT IS TEN O'CLOCK ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE DARK WALL OPPOSITE THE WINDOW SHUTS OUT THE MOONLIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THE LIGHT OF THE ONE DIP CANDLE BY WHICH BARTLE MASSEY IS PRETENDING TO READ
2817-142380-0001 THE NEGLECTED BEARD OF A MAN JUST RISEN FROM A SICK BED HIS HEAVY BLACK HAIR HANGS OVER HIS FOREHEAD AND THERE IS NO ACTIVE IMPULSE IN HIM WHICH INCLINES HIM TO PUSH IT OFF THAT HE MAY BE MORE AWAKE TO WHAT IS AROUND HIM
2817-142380-0003 SAID BARTLE MASSEY RISING HASTILY AND UNFASTENING THE DOOR IT WAS MISTER IRWINE ADAM ROSE FROM HIS CHAIR WITH INSTINCTIVE RESPECT AS MISTER IRWINE APPROACHED HIM AND TOOK HIS HAND I'M LATE ADAM
2817-142380-0004 LET US ALL SIT DOWN ADAM TOOK HIS CHAIR AGAIN MECHANICALLY AND BARTLE FOR WHOM THERE WAS NO CHAIR REMAINING SAT ON THE BED IN THE BACKGROUND HAVE YOU SEEN HER SIR
2817-142380-0006 IT IS NOT ONLY YOU SOME FATAL INFLUENCE SEEMS TO HAVE SHUT UP HER HEART AGAINST HER FELLOW CREATURES SHE HAS SCARCELY SAID ANYTHING MORE THAN NO EITHER TO ME OR THE CHAPLAIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS AGO BEFORE YOU WERE MENTIONED TO HER
2817-142380-0007 WHEN I ASKED HER IF THERE WAS ANY ONE OF HER FAMILY WHOM SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE TO WHOM SHE COULD OPEN HER MIND SHE SAID WITH A VIOLENT SHUDDER TELL THEM NOT TO COME NEAR ME I WON'T SEE ANY OF THEM
2817-142380-0009 THAT THE INTERVIEW MIGHT AFFECT HER FAVOURABLY BUT I GRIEVE TO SAY I HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE OF THAT SHE DIDN'T SEEM AGITATED WHEN I MENTIONED YOUR NAME SHE ONLY SAID NO IN THE SAME COLD OBSTINATE WAY AS USUAL
2817-142380-0010 AND IF THE MEETING HAD NO GOOD EFFECT ON HER IT WOULD BE PURE USELESS SUFFERING TO YOU SEVERE SUFFERING I FEAR SHE IS VERY MUCH CHANGED ADAM STARTED UP FROM HIS CHAIR
2817-142380-0012 AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET IS HE COME BACK SAID ADAM AT LAST NO HE IS NOT SAID MISTER IRWINE QUIETLY LAY DOWN YOUR HAT ADAM UNLESS YOU LIKE TO WALK OUT WITH ME FOR A LITTLE FRESH AIR
2817-142380-0013 I FEAR YOU HAVE NOT BEEN OUT AGAIN TO DAY YOU NEEDN'T DECEIVE ME SIR SAID ADAM LOOKING HARD AT MISTER IRWINE AND SPEAKING IN A TONE OF ANGRY SUSPICION YOU NEEDN'T BE AFRAID OF ME I ONLY WANT JUSTICE
2817-142380-0015 TO SIN AND MISERY I'M NOT DECEIVING YOU ADAM SAID MISTER IRWINE ARTHUR DONNITHORNE IS NOT COME BACK WAS NOT COME BACK WHEN I LEFT I HAVE LEFT A LETTER FOR HIM HE WILL KNOW
2817-142380-0016 HE WILL KNOW HE WILL SUFFER LONG AND BITTERLY HE HAS A HEART AND A CONSCIENCE I CAN'T BE ENTIRELY DECEIVED IN HIS CHARACTER I AM CONVINCED
2817-142380-0018 ALL HIS LIFE WHY DO YOU CRAVE VENGEANCE IN THIS WAY NO AMOUNT OF TORTURE THAT YOU COULD INFLICT ON HIM COULD BENEFIT HER NO O GOD NO ADAM GROANED OUT SINKING ON HIS CHAIR AGAIN
2817-142380-0019 BUT THEN THAT'S THE DEEPEST CURSE OF ALL THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE BLACKNESS OF IT IT CAN NEVER BE UNDONE MY POOR HETTY SHE CAN NEVER BE MY SWEET HETTY AGAIN THE PRETTIEST THING GOD HAD MADE
2817-142380-0021 BUT SHE ISN'T AS GUILTY AS THEY SAY YOU DON'T THINK SHE IS SIR SHE CAN'T HA DONE IT THAT PERHAPS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN WITH CERTAINTY ADAM MISTER IRWINE ANSWERED GENTLY
2817-142380-0022 IN THESE CASES WE SOMETIMES FORM OUR JUDGMENT ON WHAT SEEMS TO US STRONG EVIDENCE AND YET FOR WANT OF KNOWING SOME SMALL FACT OUR JUDGMENT IS WRONG BUT SUPPOSE THE WORST YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO SAY
2817-142380-0024 EVEN IN DETERMINING WHO HAS COMMITTED A SINGLE CRIMINAL ACT AND THE PROBLEM
2817-142380-0025 YOU HAVE A MIND THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THIS FULLY ADAM WHEN YOU ARE CALM DON'T SUPPOSE I CAN'T ENTER INTO THE ANGUISH THAT DRIVES YOU INTO THIS STATE OF REVENGEFUL HATRED BUT
2817-142380-0027 NO NOT WORSE SAID ADAM BITTERLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORSE I'D SOONER DO IT I'D SOONER DO A WICKEDNESS AS I COULD SUFFER FOR BY MYSELF THAN HA BROUGHT HER TO DO WICKEDNESS
2817-142380-0028 AND THEN STAND BY AND SEE EM PUNISH HER WHILE THEY LET ME ALONE AND ALL FOR A BIT O PLEASURE AS IF HE'D HAD A MAN'S HEART IN HIM HE'D HA CUT HIS HAND OFF SOONER THAN HE'D HA TAKEN IT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T FORESEE WHAT'S HAPPENED
2817-142380-0030 NOT HALF SO HATEFUL AS THAT LET A MAN DO WHAT HE WILL IF HE KNOWS HE'S TO BEAR THE PUNISHMENT HIMSELF
2817-142380-0031 AND KNOWS ALL THE WHILE THE PUNISHMENT LL FALL ON SOMEBODY ELSE THERE AGAIN YOU PARTLY DECEIVE YOURSELF ADAM THERE IS NO SORT OF WRONG DEED OF WHICH A MAN CAN BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF
2817-142380-0033 ADDED TO THOSE WE ARE SUFFERING UNDER YOU COULD NOT BEAR THE PUNISHMENT ALONE YOU WOULD ENTAIL THE WORST SORROWS ON EVERY ONE WHO LOVES YOU YOU WOULD HAVE COMMITTED AN ACT OF BLIND FURY THAT WOULD LEAVE ALL THE PRESENT EVILS JUST AS THEY WERE
2817-142380-0034 AS LONG AS YOU DO NOT SEE THAT TO FIX YOUR MIND ON ARTHUR'S PUNISHMENT IS REVENGE AND NOT JUSTICE YOU ARE IN DANGER OF BEING LED ON TO THE COMMISSION OF SOME GREAT WRONG REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS
2817-142380-0036 WHILE HE SPOKE TO BARTLE MASSEY ABOUT OLD MISTER DONNITHORNE'S FUNERAL AND OTHER MATTERS OF AN INDIFFERENT KIND BUT AT LENGTH ADAM TURNED ROUND AND SAID IN A MORE SUBDUED TONE
2817-142380-0037 IS DINAH MORRIS COME TO EM SIR SETH SAID THEY'D SENT FOR HER NO MISTER POYSER TELLS ME SHE WAS NOT COME WHEN HE LEFT THEY'RE AFRAID THE LETTER HAS NOT REACHED HER
2817-142380-0039 BUT PERHAPS THE POYSERS

2836-5354-0002 WHEN A HIGH PRINCIPLED GENTLEWOMAN FALLS FROM HER PEDESTAL NEVER HAD SHE EXPERIENCED A MOMENT'S CALM OR PEACE OR HAPPINESS SINCE THE FATAL NIGHT OF QUITTING HER HOME SHE HAD TAKEN A BLIND LEAP IN A MOMENT OF WILD PASSION
2836-5354-0003 WHEN INSTEAD OF THE GARDEN OF ROSES IT HAD BEEN HER PERSUADER'S PLEASURE TO PROMISE HER SHE WOULD FALL INTO BUT WHICH IN TRUTH SHE HAD BARELY GLANCED AT FOR THAT HAD NOT BEEN HER MOVING MOTIVE
2836-5354-0005 WHOSE ASPECT HAD BEEN SHUNNED IN THE PROSPECTIVE ASSUMED AT ONCE ITS TRUE FRIGHTFUL COLOR THE BLACKNESS OF DARKNESS AND A LIVELY REMORSE A NEVER DYING ANGUISH TOOK POSSESSION OF HER SOUL FOREVER OH READER BELIEVE ME

2836-5355-0008 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE UNDECEIVED ME THEN TO HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE HOPES I WAS CHERISHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE UNBORN CHILD WERE WORSE THAN VAIN I DID NOT JUDGE SO HE REPLIED THE EXCITED STATE YOU THEN APPEARED TO BE IN

2836-5355-0049 SIR FRANCIS THANKING HIS LUCKY STAR THAT HE HAD SO EASILY GOT RID OF A VEXATIOUS ANNOYANCE AND LADY ISABEL SHE PASSED HER EVENING ALONE SITTING IN THE SAME PLACE CLOSE TO THE FIRE AND THE SPARKS
2836-5355-0050 INTO AN ADJOINING ROOM WHEN LADY ISABEL LAY DOWN TO REST SHE SANK INTO A SOMEWHAT CALMER SLEEP THAN SHE HAD KNOWN OF LATE ALSO INTO A DREAM SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS BACK AT EAST LYNNE NOT BACK IN ONE SENSE
2836-5355-0052 EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS CONNECTED WITH THE OFFICE AND OLD MISTER DILL AND THAT MISTER CARLYLE LAUGHED WHEN HE TOLD IT THEY APPEARED TO BE INTERRUPTED BY THE CRYING OF ARCHIBALD AND IN TURNING TO THE LAWN TO ASK WHAT WAS THE MATTER SHE AWOKE
2836-5355-0053 ALAS IT WAS THE ACTUAL CRYING OF HER OWN CHILD WHICH AWOKE HER THIS LAST CHILD THE ILL FATED LITTLE BEING IN THE CRADLE BESIDE HER
2843-152918-0001 AS REGARDS OURSELVES A DAY OR TWO LONGER MADE NO DIFFERENCE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ARTICLE OF DIET THE PEMMICAN WAS PRACTICALLY LEFT UNTOUCHED AS FOR THE TIME BEING DOG HAD COMPLETELY TAKEN ITS PLACE
2843-152918-0002 THERE WAS THUS NO GREAT SIGN OF DEPRESSION TO BE NOTICED WHEN WE CAME BACK INTO THE TENT AFTER FINISHING OUR WORK AND HAD TO WHILE AWAY THE TIME AS I WENT IN I COULD DESCRY WISTING A LITTLE WAY OFF KNEELING ON THE GROUND
2843-152918-0004 TO WHATEVER AGE I MAY LIVE IN THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT THE WIND HAD GONE BACK TO THE NORTH AND INCREASED TO A GALE IT WAS BLOWING AND SNOWING SO THAT WHEN WE CAME OUT IN THE MORNING WE COULD NOT SEE THE SLEDGES THEY WERE HALF SNOWED UNDER
2843-152918-0005 THE TEMPERATURE WAS NOT SO VERY LOW
2843-152918-0007 THIS IS THE FIFTH DAY AND IT'S BLOWING WORSE THAN EVER WE ALL AGREED THERE'S NOTHING SO BAD AS LYING WEATHER BOUND LIKE THIS CONTINUED ANOTHER IT TAKES MORE OUT OF YOU THAN GOING FROM MORNING TO NIGHT PERSONALLY I WAS OF THE SAME OPINION
2843-152918-0008 ONE DAY MAY BE PLEASANT ENOUGH BUT TWO THREE FOUR
2843-152918-0010 IT IS THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING THAT COMES FIRST TO MY MIND ALL THE QUALITIES THAT I MOST ADMIRE IN A MAN WERE CLEARLY SHOWN AT THAT JUNCTURE COURAGE AND DAUNTLESSNESS WITHOUT BOASTING OR BIG WORDS
2843-152918-0011 AMID JOKING AND CHAFF EVERYTHING WAS PACKED AND THEN OUT INTO THE BLIZZARD IT WAS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN THE FINE DRIFT SNOW PENETRATED EVERYWHERE
2843-152918-0013 WHICH WE NOW THOUGHT WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED WERE LEFT BEHIND THE LAST THING TO BE DONE WAS PLANTING A BROKEN SKI UPRIGHT BY THE SIDE OF THE DEPOT IT WAS WISTING WHO DID THIS THINKING PRESUMABLY THAT AN EXTRA MARK WOULD DO NO HARM
2843-152918-0014 THAT IT WAS A HAPPY THOUGHT THE FUTURE WILL SHOW AND THEN WE WERE OFF IT WAS A HARD PULL TO BEGIN WITH BOTH FOR MEN AND BEASTS AS THE HIGH SASTRUGI CONTINUED TOWARDS THE SOUTH
2843-152918-0016 AS WE HAD NOTHING TO LEAN AGAINST WE WENT ON LIKE THIS SLOWLY ENOUGH BUT THE MAIN THING WAS THAT WE MADE PROGRESS THE GROUND AT FIRST GAVE ONE THE IMPRESSION OF RISING THOUGH NOT MUCH THE GOING WAS EXTREMELY HEAVY
2843-152918-0017 IT WAS LIKE DRAGGING ONESELF THROUGH SAND MEANWHILE THE SASTRUGI GREW SMALLER AND SMALLER AND FINALLY THEY DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER AND THE SURFACE BECAME QUITE FLAT THE GOING ALSO IMPROVED BY DEGREES
2843-152918-0019 WHICH HAD BECOME PERFECTLY LEVEL HAD THE APPEARANCE AT TIMES OF SINKING IN ANY CASE ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SO FROM THE PACE OF THE SLEDGES NOW AND AGAIN THE DOGS WOULD SET OFF SUDDENLY AT A GALLOP THE WIND AFT NO DOUBT HELPED THE PACE SOMEWHAT
2843-152918-0020 BUT IT ALONE COULD NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE I DID NOT LIKE THIS TENDENCY OF THE GROUND TO FALL AWAY IN MY OPINION WE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE WITH ANYTHING OF THAT SORT AFTER REACHING THE HEIGHT AT WHICH WE WERE A SLIGHT SLOPE UPWARD
2843-152918-0022 WOULD BE MADNESS WE MIGHT RISK FALLING INTO SOME CHASM BEFORE WE HAD TIME TO PULL UP HANSSEN AS USUAL WAS DRIVING FIRST STRICTLY SPEAKING I SHOULD NOW HAVE BEEN GOING IN ADVANCE BUT THE UNEVEN SURFACE AT THE START
2843-152918-0023 AND THE RAPID PACE AFTERWARDS HAD MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO WALK AS FAST THE DOGS COULD PULL I WAS THEREFORE FOLLOWING BY THE SIDE OF WISTING'S SLEDGE AND CHATTING WITH HIM SUDDENLY I SAW HANSSEN'S DOGS SHOOT AHEAD
2843-152918-0025 BY TWISTING HIS SLEDGE THE OTHERS WHO WERE FOLLOWING STOPPED WHEN THEY CAME UP TO HIM WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FAIRLY STEEP DESCENT WHAT THERE MIGHT BE BELOW WAS NOT EASY TO DECIDE NOR WOULD WE TRY TO FIND OUT IN THAT WEATHER
2843-152918-0026 WE TRAMPLED DOWN A PLACE FOR THE TENT IN THE LOOSE SNOW AND SOON GOT IT UP IT WAS NOT A LONG DAY'S MARCH THAT WE HAD DONE ELEVEN AND THREE QUARTER MILES BUT WE HAD PUT AN END TO OUR STAY AT THE BUTCHER'S SHOP AND THAT WAS A GREAT THING
2843-152918-0028 ONE HAS TO SEIZE EVERY OPPORTUNITY IN THESE REGIONS IF ONE NEGLECTS TO DO SO IT MAY MEAN A LONG WAIT AND MUCH MAY BE LOST WE THEREFORE ALL SLEPT WITH ONE EYE OPEN
2843-152918-0029 AND WE KNEW WELL THAT NOTHING COULD HAPPEN WITHOUT OUR NOTICING IT AT THREE IN THE MORNING THE SUN CUT THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WE THROUGH THE TENT DOOR TO TAKE IN THE SITUATION WAS MORE THAN THE WORK OF A MOMENT
2843-152918-0031 TURNING OUT OF ONE'S GOOD WARM SLEEPING BAG AND STANDING OUTSIDE FOR SOME TIME IN THIN CLOTHES WATCHING THE WEATHER WE KNEW BY EXPERIENCE THAT A GLEAM LIKE THIS A CLEARING IN THE WEATHER MIGHT COME SUDDENLY AND THEN ONE HAD TO BE ON THE SPOT
2843-152918-0032 THE GLEAM CAME IT DID NOT LAST LONG BUT LONG ENOUGH WE LAY ON THE SIDE OF A RIDGE THAT FELL AWAY PRETTY STEEPLY THE DESCENT ON THE SOUTH WAS TOO ABRUPT BUT ON THE SOUTH EAST IT WAS BETTER AND MORE GRADUAL
2843-152918-0034 HAD NOW BROKEN LOOSE AGAIN AND THE NORTH EASTER WAS DOING ALL IT COULD
2843-152918-0035 SINCE WE HAD DISCOVERED THE NATURE OF OUR IMMEDIATE SURROUNDINGS IF WE ONCE GOT DOWN TO THE PLAIN WE KNEW THAT WE COULD ALWAYS FEEL OUR WAY ON AFTER PUTTING AMPLE BRAKES ON THE SLEDGE RUNNERS
2843-152918-0037 WE COULD NOW ONCE MORE SET OUR FACES TO THE SOUTH AND IN THICK DRIVING SNOW WE CONTINUED OUR WAY INTO THE UNKNOWN WITH GOOD ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOWLING NORTH EASTERLY GALE WE NOW RECOMMENCED THE ERECTION OF BEACONS
2843-152918-0038 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN NECESSARY DURING THE ASCENT
2843-152918-0040 WHICH WAS REAL TORTURE TO ALL OF US A SLEDGE JOURNEY THROUGH THE SAHARA COULD NOT HAVE OFFERED A WORSE SURFACE TO MOVE OVER
2843-152918-0041 THE WEATHER IMPROVED IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND WHEN WE CAMPED IN THE AFTERNOON IT LOOKED QUITE SMILING THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND GAVE A DELIGHTFUL WARMTH AFTER THE LAST FEW BITTER DAYS IT WAS NOT YET CLEAR
2843-152918-0043 OUR ALTITUDE CAME OUT AT NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA OR A DROP OF EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE FEET IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY THIS SURPRISED ME GREATLY WHAT DID IT MEAN
2843-152918-0044 INSTEAD OF RISING GRADUALLY WE WERE GOING SLOWLY DOWN
2843-152918-0046 THE NIGHT WAS FILLED WITH SHARP GUSTS FROM THE NORTH THE MORNING CAME WITH A SLACK WIND BUT ACCOMPANIED BY MIST AND SNOWFALL THIS WAS ABOMINABLE HERE WE WERE ADVANCING OVER ABSOLUTELY VIRGIN GROUND AND ABLE TO SEE NOTHING
2843-152918-0047 THE SURFACE REMAINED ABOUT THE SAME POSSIBLY RATHER MORE UNDULATING THAT IT HAD BEEN BLOWING HERE AT SOME TIME AND VIOLENTLY TOO WAS SHOWN BY THE UNDER SURFACE WHICH WAS COMPOSED OF SASTRUGI AS HARD AS IRON
2843-152918-0049 AND FRETTING AT THE PERSISTENTLY THICK WEATHER ONE OF US SUDDENLY CALLED OUT HULLO LOOK THERE A WILD DARK SUMMIT ROSE HIGH OUT OF THE MASS OF FOG TO THE EAST SOUTH EAST IT WAS NOT FAR AWAY
2843-152918-0050 ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED THREATENINGLY NEAR AND RIGHT OVER US WE STOPPED AND LOOKED AT THE IMPOSING SIGHT BUT NATURE DID NOT EXPOSE HER OBJECTS OF INTEREST FOR LONG THE FOG ROLLED OVER AGAIN THICK HEAVY AND DARK
2843-152918-0052 TWO LONG NARROW MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO THE WEST OF US RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH AND COMPLETELY COVERED WITH SNOW THESE
2843-152918-0053 THEY WERE BETWEEN NINE THOUSAND AND TEN THOUSAND FEET HIGH AND WOULD PROBABLY SERVE AS EXCELLENT LANDMARKS ON THE RETURN JOURNEY THERE WAS NO CONNECTION TO BE TRACED BETWEEN THESE MOUNTAINS AND THOSE LYING TO THE EAST OF THEM
2843-152918-0055 WE CONTINUED OUR COURSE IN THE CONSTANT EXPECTATION OF FINDING SOME SURPRISE OR OTHER IN OUR LINE OF ROUTE THE AIR AHEAD OF US WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH AS THOUGH IT CONCEALED SOMETHING
2843-152918-0056 IT COULD NOT BE A STORM OR IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ALREADY UPON US BUT WE WENT ON AND ON AND NOTHING CAME OUR DAY'S MARCH WAS EIGHTEEN AND A HALF MILES I SEE THAT MY DIARY FOR NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH
2843-152918-0058 BUT THE DAY DID NOT TURN OUT SO BADLY AFTER ALL AS WE WORKED OUR WAY OUT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND FOUND OUT WHAT WAS BEHIND THE PITCH DARK CLOUDS DURING THE FORENOON THE SUN CAME THROUGH AND THRUST ASIDE THE FOG FOR A WHILE AND THERE
2843-152918-0059 TO THE SOUTH EAST NOT MANY MILES AWAY LAY AN IMMENSE MOUNTAIN MASS FROM THIS MASS RIGHT ACROSS OUR COURSE RAN A GREAT ANCIENT GLACIER THE SUN SHONE DOWN UPON IT AND SHOWED US A SURFACE FULL OF HUGE IRREGULARITIES
2843-152918-0061 AND WAITED FOR DECENTLY CLEAR WEATHER SO THAT WE MIGHT SURVEY THE GROUND AT OUR EASE AND CHOOSE THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD WITHOUT AN IDEA OF WHAT THE GROUND WAS LIKE WAS NOT VERY PLEASANT
2843-152918-0062 BUT HOW LONG SHOULD WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR CLEAR WEATHER THAT QUESTION WAS UNANSWERABLE POSSIBLY A WEEK OR EVEN A FORTNIGHT AND WE HAD NO TIME FOR THAT BETTER GO STRAIGHT ON THEN AND TAKE WHAT MIGHT COME
2843-152918-0064 WE COULD SEE THAT THE BIG CREVASSES LOST THEMSELVES IN IT AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT THE GLACIER LOOKED LIKE ON THE WEST
2843-152918-0065 IT WAS PLAIN ENOUGH THAT WE SHOULD HAVE STIFF WORK IT WAS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE ON THE SLEDGES WE SET TO WORK AT ONCE TO BUILD THE DEPOT THE SNOW HERE WAS EXCELLENT FOR THIS PURPOSE
2843-152918-0067 A NUMBER OF SMALL ARTICLES WERE ALSO LEFT BEHIND WHILE WE WERE THUS OCCUPIED THE FOG HAD BEEN COMING AND GOING SOME OF THE INTERVALS HAD BEEN QUITE CLEAR AND HAD GIVEN ME A GOOD VIEW OF THE NEAREST PART OF THE RANGE
2843-152918-0068 IT APPEARED TO BE QUITE ISOLATED AND TO CONSIST OF FOUR MOUNTAINS ONE OF THESE MOUNT HELMER HANSSEN LAY SEPARATED FROM THE REST THE OTHER THREE MOUNTS OSCAR WISTING
2843-152918-0070 AND THE SUMMITS OF A COLOSSAL MOUNTAIN MASS APPEARED OUR FIRST IMPRESSION WAS THAT THIS MOUNTAIN MOUNT THORVALD NILSEN MUST BE SOMETHING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND FEET HIGH IT POSITIVELY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY
2843-152918-0071 SO FORMIDABLE DID IT APPEAR BUT IT WAS ONLY A GLIMPSE THAT WE HAD AND THEN THE FOG ENCLOSED IT ONCE MORE WE HAD SUCCEEDED IN TAKING A FEW MEAGRE BEARINGS OF THE DIFFERENT SUMMITS OF THE NEAREST GROUP
2843-152918-0073 HAVING FINISHED THE EDIFICE WHICH ROSE AT LEAST SIX FEET INTO THE AIR
2843-152918-0074 SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT STILL MORE EASILY ON THE WAY BACK AN OBSERVATION WE HAD CONTRIVED TO TAKE WHILE THE WORK WAS IN PROGRESS
2843-152918-0076 AND A FINE LIGHT SNOW WAS FALLING WE HAD TAKEN A BEARING OF THE LINE OF GLACIER THAT WAS MOST FREE OF CREVASSES AND SO WE MOVED ON AGAIN
2843-152918-0077 THE CREVASSES AT ITS FOOT WERE NOT LARGE BUT WE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED UPON THE ASCENT THAN THE FUN BEGAN THERE WAS SOMETHING UNCANNY ABOUT THIS PERFECTLY BLIND ADVANCE AMONG CREVASSES AND CHASMS ON ALL SIDES
2843-152918-0079 BUT THAT AFTER ALL WAS NOT MUCH OF A HELP TO OUR DRIVERS
2843-152918-0080 AS THE CREVASSES WERE OFTEN RENDERED QUITE INVISIBLE BY A THIN OVERLYING LAYER OF SNOW
2843-152918-0082 BY USING THE UTMOST CAUTION WISTING CAME NEAR TO SOUNDING THE DEPTH OF ONE OF THESE DANGEROUS CREVASSES WITH SLEDGE DOGS AND ALL AS THE BRIDGE HE WAS ABOUT TO CROSS GAVE WAY THANKS TO HIS PRESENCE OF MIND
2843-152918-0083 AND A LIGHTNING LIKE MOVEMENT SOME WOULD CALL IT LUCK HE MANAGED TO SAVE HIMSELF IN THIS WAY WE WORKED UP ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FEET BUT THEN WE CAME UPON SUCH A LABYRINTH OF YAWNING CHASMS AND OPEN ABYSSES
2843-152918-0085 IT REQUIRED SOME STUDY TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE TRAP WE HAD RUN OURSELVES INTO TOWARDS THE GROUP OF MOUNTAINS LAST DESCRIBED WHICH NOW LAY TO THE EAST OF US
2843-152918-0086 IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND EVOKED A PICTURE OF VIOLENT CONFUSION THANK GOD WE WERE NOT HERE WHILE THIS WAS GOING ON I THOUGHT TO MYSELF AS I STOOD LOOKING OUT OVER THIS BATTLEFIELD IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECTACLE LIKE DOOMSDAY
2843-152918-0088 THIS RIDGE LED US ON TO AN ICEWAVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH A FORMATION WHICH WAS DUE TO THE PRESSURE HAVING CEASED BEFORE THE WAVE HAD BEEN FORCED TO BREAK AND FORM HUMMOCKS
2843-152918-0089 WE SAW WELL ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULD BE A DIFFICULT PLACE TO PASS WITH SLEDGES AND DOGS BUT IN DEFAULT OF ANYTHING BETTER IT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE FROM THE TOP OF THIS WAVE FORMATION WE COULD SEE DOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE
2843-152918-0091 AS WE SAW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OUR OBJECT WAS TO MAKE TRACKS FOR THE FOLLOWING DAY'S JOURNEY THE LANGUAGE WE USED ABOUT THE GLACIER AS WE WENT WAS NOT ALTOGETHER COMPLIMENTARY WE HAD ENDLESS TACKING AND TURNING TO GET ON
2843-152918-0092 A FISSURE HAD OPENED MAKING A GATEWAY ABOUT SIX FEET WIDE THIS FORMATION LIKE EVERY THING ELSE ON THE GLACIER WAS OBVIOUSLY VERY OLD AND FOR THE MOST PART FILLED WITH SNOW
2843-152918-0094 OUR COMPANIONS WERE NO LESS PLEASED WITH THE NEWS WE BROUGHT OF OUR PROSPECTS OUR ALTITUDE THAT EVENING WAS EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIFTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THAT IS TO SAY AT THE FOOT OF THE GLACIER
2843-152918-0095 WE HAD REACHED AN ALTITUDE OF EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FEET OR A DROP FROM THE BUTCHER'S OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FEET WE NOW KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS ASCENT TO MAKE AGAIN PERHAPS EVEN MORE
2843-152918-0097 AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY THAT WE WERE UNDERTAKING THROUGH NEW REGIONS NEW MOUNTAINS GLACIERS AND SO ON WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE
2843-152918-0098 WHAT I LIKED LEAST ABOUT THIS FEELING ONE'S WAY FORWARD IN THE DARK WAS THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT VERY DIFFICULT INDEED TO RECOGNIZE THE GROUND AGAIN ON THE WAY BACK BUT WITH THIS GLACIER LYING STRAIGHT ACROSS OUR LINE OF ROUTE
2843-152918-0100 AND FOR OUR FINAL SUCCESS WE OWE A DEEP DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO OUR PRUDENCE AND THOUGHTFULNESS IN ADOPTING THIS EXPEDIENT NEXT MORNING NOVEMBER TWENTY NINTH BROUGHT CONSIDERABLY CLEARER WEATHER
2843-152918-0101 AND ALLOWED US A VERY GOOD SURVEY OF OUR POSITION WE COULD NOW SEE THAT THE TWO MOUNTAIN RANGES
2843-152918-0103 A GROUP BY THEMSELVES AND LAY SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN RANGE THE DRIVERS HAD A WARM MORNING'S WORK THEY HAD TO DRIVE WITH GREAT CIRCUMSPECTION AND PATIENCE TO GRAPPLE WITH THE KIND OF GROUND WE HAD BEFORE US
2843-152918-0104 A SLIGHT MISTAKE MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SEND BOTH SLEDGE AND DOGS WITH LIGHTNING RAPIDITY INTO THE NEXT WORLD IT TOOK NEVERTHELESS A REMARKABLY SHORT TIME TO COVER THE DISTANCE WE HAD EXPLORED ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING BEFORE WE KNEW IT
2843-152918-0106 BELOW THE HIGH SNOW RIDGE THAT FORMS ONE SIDE OF A VERY WIDE BUT PARTLY FILLED UP CREVASSE THE MARKS OF SKI CAN BE SEEN IN THE SNOW THIS WAS THE PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IN PASSING OVER THIS SNOW BRIDGE
2843-152918-0107 STRUCK HIS SKI INTO IT TO TRY THE STRENGTH OF THE SUPPORT CLOSE TO THE TRACKS CAN BE SEEN AN OPEN PIECE OF THE CREVASSE IT IS A PALE BLUE AT THE TOP BUT ENDS IN THE DEEPEST BLACK IN A BOTTOMLESS ABYSS
2843-152918-0109 BUT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE TURNS AND CIRCUITS WE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO MAKE IT WAS NOT SO SHORT AFTER ALL WE SET OUR TENT ON A GOOD SOLID FOUNDATION AND WERE WELL PLEASED WITH THE DAY'S WORK
2843-152918-0110 THE ALTITUDE WAS EIGHT THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY FEET ABOVE THE SEA THE SUN WAS NOW IN THE WEST AND SHINING DIRECTLY UPON THE HUGE MOUNTAIN MASSES IT WAS A FAIRY LANDSCAPE IN BLUE AND WHITE
2843-152918-0112 WHICH LED ONE TO SUSPECT A CONTINUATION IN THAT DIRECTION THOUGH ONE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN MOUNT NILSEN AH ANYTHING MORE BEAUTIFUL TAKING IT ALTOGETHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN
2843-152918-0113 PEAKS OF THE MOST VARIED FORMS ROSE HIGH INTO THE AIR PARTLY COVERED WITH DRIVING CLOUDS SOME WERE SHARP BUT MOST WERE LONG AND ROUNDED HERE AND THERE ONE SAW BRIGHT SHINING GLACIERS
2843-152918-0115 AND COVERED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ICE SHEET WHICH WAS SO BROKEN UP AND DISTURBED THAT THE BLOCKS OF ICE BRISTLED IN EVERY DIRECTION LIKE THE QUILLS OF A PORCUPINE IT GLITTERED AND BURNED IN THE SUNLIGHT A GLORIOUS SPECTACLE
2893-139310-0000 THE PEOPLE MARCH HE BECAME AWARE OF SOMEONE URGING A GLASS OF CLEAR FLUID UPON HIS ATTENTION LOOKED UP AND DISCOVERED THIS WAS A DARK YOUNG MAN IN A YELLOW GARMENT HE TOOK THE DOSE FORTHWITH AND IN A MOMENT HE WAS GLOWING
2893-139310-0002 BEHIND THE MAN WAS A GIRL IN A SILVERY GREY ROBE WHOM GRAHAM EVEN IN THIS CONFUSION PERCEIVED TO BE BEAUTIFUL HER DARK EYES FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY WERE FIXED ON HIM HER LIPS TREMBLED APART
2893-139310-0003 A PARTIALLY OPENED DOOR GAVE A GLIMPSE OF THE CROWDED HALL AND ADMITTED A VAST UNEVEN TUMULT A HAMMERING CLAPPING AND SHOUTING THAT DIED AWAY AND BEGAN AGAIN AND ROSE TO A THUNDEROUS PITCH
2893-139310-0005 HE GRASPED THE ARM OF THIS SHOUTING PERSON TELL ME HE CRIED WHO AM I WHO AM I THE OTHERS CAME NEARER TO HEAR HIS WORDS
2893-139310-0006 HIS EYES SEARCHED THEIR FACES THEY HAVE TOLD HIM NOTHING CRIED THE GIRL TELL ME TELL ME CRIED GRAHAM YOU ARE THE MASTER OF THE EARTH YOU ARE OWNER OF THE WORLD
2893-139310-0008 IT IS LONDON YES SAID THE YOUNGER MAN AND THOSE WHO MEET IN THE GREAT HALL WITH THE WHITE ATLAS HOW DOES IT CONCERN ME
2893-139310-0009 COUNCILLORS UNDER THE ATLAS WHY SHOULD THEY TRY TO DRUG ME TO KEEP YOU INSENSIBLE SAID THE MAN IN YELLOW TO PREVENT YOUR INTERFERENCE
2893-139310-0011 THREADED BY ONE MONOTONOUS VOICE NOW SUDDENLY TRAMPLING ON THESE LAST WORDS CAME A DEAFENING TUMULT A ROARING AND THUNDERING CHEER CROWDED ON CHEER VOICES HOARSE AND SHRILL BEATING OVERLAPPING AND WHILE IT LASTED
2893-139310-0012 THE PEOPLE IN THE LITTLE ROOM COULD NOT HEAR EACH OTHER SHOUT GRAHAM STOOD HIS INTELLIGENCE CLINGING HELPLESSLY TO THE THING HE HAD JUST HEARD THE COUNCIL HE REPEATED BLANKLY AND THEN SNATCHED AT A NAME THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
2893-139310-0014 OUR LEADER IN YOUR NAME IN MY NAME
2893-139310-0015 WHY IS HE NOT HERE HE HAS DEPUTED US I AM HIS BROTHER HIS HALF BROTHER LINCOLN HE WANTS YOU TO SHOW YOURSELF TO THESE PEOPLE AND THEN COME ON TO HIM THAT IS WHY HE HAS SENT
2893-139310-0017 THE YOUNGER MAN SUDDENLY BECAME AUDIBLE IN A PAUSE OF THE OUTER THUNDER
2893-139310-0018 NO ONE EXPECTED YOU TO WAKE THEY WERE CUNNING DAMNED TYRANTS BUT THEY WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER TO DRUG YOU HYPNOTISE YOU KILL YOU AGAIN THE HALL DOMINATED EVERYTHING OSTROG IS AT THE WIND VANE OFFICES READY
2893-139310-0020 EVEN NOW HE MAY BE DOING THAT THEN THIS PUBLIC THEATRE BAWLED THE MAN IN YELLOW IS ONLY A CONTINGENT WE HAVE FIVE MYRIADS OF DRILLED MEN WE HAVE ARMS CRIED LINCOLN WE HAVE PLANS A LEADER
2893-139310-0021 MASSED IN THE INAUDIBLE IT IS NOW OR NEVER THE COUNCIL IS ROCKING THEY CANNOT TRUST EVEN THEIR DRILLED MEN HEAR THE PEOPLE CALLING TO YOU GRAHAM'S MIND WAS LIKE A NIGHT OF MOON AND SWIFT CLOUDS
2893-139310-0023 ON THE ONE HAND WAS THE WHITE COUNCIL POWERFUL DISCIPLINED FEW
2893-139310-0024 MONSTROUS CROWDS PACKED MASSES OF INDISTINGUISHABLE PEOPLE CLAMOURING HIS NAME HAILING HIM MASTER THE OTHER SIDE HAD IMPRISONED HIM DEBATED HIS DEATH THESE SHOUTING THOUSANDS BEYOND THE LITTLE DOORWAY HAD RESCUED HIM
2893-139310-0026 AND LINCOLN GESTICULATING THE VOICES WITHOUT EXPLAINED THEIR SOUNDLESS LIPS SHOW US THE SLEEPER SHOW US THE SLEEPER WAS THE BURDEN OF THE UPROAR MEN WERE BAWLING FOR ORDER SILENCE
2893-139310-0027 A WAVING INCESSANT CONFUSION OF CROWDED SHOUTING FACES MEN AND WOMEN TOGETHER WAVING PALE BLUE GARMENTS EXTENDED HANDS MANY WERE STANDING ONE MAN IN RAGS OF DARK BROWN A GAUNT FIGURE STOOD ON THE SEAT AND WAVED A BLACK CLOTH
2893-139310-0029 BUT A MOMENT THAT WAS NEAR TO PANIC PASSED HE TRIED TO MAKE AUDIBLE INQUIRIES OF
2893-139310-0030 LINCOLN WAS SHOUTING IN HIS EAR BUT GRAHAM WAS DEAFENED TO THAT ALL THE OTHERS SAVE THE WOMAN GESTICULATED TOWARDS THE HALL HE PERCEIVED WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO THE UPROAR THE WHOLE MASS OF PEOPLE WAS CHANTING TOGETHER IT WAS NOT SIMPLY A SONG
2893-139310-0032 FULL OF FLAUNTING BANNERS FULL OF THE MARCH AND PAGEANTRY OF OPENING WAR AND THE FEET OF THE PEOPLE WERE BEATING TIME TRAMP TRAMP HE WAS URGED TOWARDS THE DOOR HE OBEYED MECHANICALLY
2893-139310-0033 THE STRENGTH OF THAT CHANT TOOK HOLD OF HIM STIRRED HIM EMBOLDENED HIM THE HALL OPENED TO HIM
2893-139310-0035 HE THREW HIS ARM FREE OF THIS AND FOLLOWED LINCOLN HE PERCEIVED THE GIRL IN GREY CLOSE TO HIM HER FACE LIT HER GESTURE ONWARD FOR THE INSTANT SHE BECAME TO HIM FLUSHED AND EAGER AS SHE WAS AN EMBODIMENT OF THE SONG
2893-139310-0036 HE EMERGED IN THE ALCOVE AGAIN INCONTINENTLY THE MOUNTING WAVES OF THE SONG BROKE UPON HIS APPEARING AND FLASHED UP INTO A FOAM OF SHOUTING GUIDED BY LINCOLN'S HAND HE MARCHED OBLIQUELY ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE STAGE FACING THE PEOPLE
2893-139310-0038 THE WHOLE MULTITUDE WAS SWAYING IN CONGESTED MASSES INDIVIDUAL FIGURES SPRANG OUT OF THE TUMULT IMPRESSED HIM MOMENTARILY AND LOST DEFINITION AGAIN CLOSE TO THE PLATFORM SWAYED A BEAUTIFUL FAIR WOMAN CARRIED BY THREE MEN
2893-139310-0039 HER HAIR ACROSS HER FACE AND BRANDISHING A GREEN STAFF NEXT THIS GROUP AN OLD CAREWORN MAN IN BLUE CANVAS MAINTAINED HIS PLACE IN THE CRUSH WITH DIFFICULTY AND BEHIND SHOUTED A HAIRLESS FACE A GREAT CAVITY OF TOOTHLESS MOUTH A VOICE CALLED
2893-139310-0041 FLASHED AND SLANTED THEN HE SAW THOSE NEAREST TO HIM ON A LEVEL SPACE BEFORE THE STAGE WERE MARCHING IN FRONT OF HIM PASSING TOWARDS A GREAT ARCHWAY SHOUTING TO THE COUNCIL TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP HE RAISED HIS ARM AND THE ROARING WAS REDOUBLED
2893-139310-0042 MARCH HIS MOUTH SHAPED INAUDIBLE HEROIC WORDS HE WAVED HIS ARM AGAIN AND POINTED TO THE ARCHWAY SHOUTING ONWARD THEY WERE NO LONGER MARKING TIME THEY WERE MARCHING TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP IN THAT HOST
2893-139310-0044 A MONSTROUS BLACK BANNER JERKED ITS WAY TO THE RIGHT HE PERCEIVED A BLUE CLAD NEGRO A SHRIVELLED WOMAN IN YELLOW THEN A GROUP OF TALL FAIR HAIRED WHITE FACED BLUE CLAD MEN PUSHED THEATRICALLY PAST HIM HE NOTED TWO CHINAMEN
2893-139310-0045 A TALL SALLOW DARK HAIRED SHINING EYED YOUTH WHITE CLAD FROM TOP TO TOE CLAMBERED UP TOWARDS THE PLATFORM SHOUTING LOYALLY AND SPRANG DOWN AGAIN AND RECEDED LOOKING BACKWARD HEADS SHOULDERS
2893-139310-0047 MOST OF THE FACES WERE FLUSHED BUT MANY WERE GHASTLY WHITE AND DISEASE WAS THERE AND MANY A HAND THAT WAVED TO HIM WAS GAUNT AND LEAN MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NEW AGE STRANGE AND INCREDIBLE MEETING AS THE BROAD STREAM PASSED BEFORE HIM TO THE RIGHT
2893-139310-0048 TRIBUTARY GANGWAYS FROM THE REMOTE UPLANDS OF THE HALL THRUST DOWNWARD IN AN INCESSANT REPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP THE UNISON OF THE SONG WAS ENRICHED AND COMPLICATED BY THE MASSIVE ECHOES OF ARCHES AND PASSAGES MEN AND WOMEN
2893-139310-0050 AT LINCOLN'S PRESSURE HE TURNED TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY WALKING UNCONSCIOUSLY IN THAT RHYTHM SCARCELY NOTICING HIS MOVEMENT FOR THE MELODY AND STIR OF IT THE MULTITUDE THE GESTURE AND SONG ALL MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION
2893-139310-0051 THE FLOW OF PEOPLE SMOTE DOWNWARD UNTIL THE UPTURNED FACES WERE BELOW THE LEVEL OF HIS FEET HE WAS AWARE OF A PATH BEFORE HIM OF A SUITE ABOUT HIM OF GUARDS AND DIGNITIES AND LINCOLN ON HIS RIGHT HAND
2893-139310-0053 WITH THE TORRENT DIPPING TO FLOW BENEATH AND SHOUTING UP TO HIM HE DID NOT KNOW WHITHER HE WENT HE DID NOT WANT TO KNOW HE GLANCED BACK ACROSS A FLAMING SPACIOUSNESS OF HALL
2893-139322-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE THE UNDER SIDE FROM THE BUSINESS QUARTER THEY PRESENTLY PASSED BY THE RUNNING WAYS INTO A REMOTE QUARTER OF THE CITY WHERE THE BULK OF THE MANUFACTURES WAS DONE
2893-139322-0002 THE RIVER WAS A BROAD WRINKLED GLITTER OF BLACK SEA WATER OVERARCHED BY BUILDINGS AND VANISHING EITHER WAY INTO A BLACKNESS STARRED WITH RECEDING LIGHTS A STRING OF BLACK BARGES PASSED SEAWARD MANNED BY BLUE CLAD MEN
2893-139322-0003 THE ROAD WAS A LONG AND VERY BROAD AND HIGH TUNNEL ALONG WHICH BIG WHEELED MACHINES DROVE NOISELESSLY AND SWIFTLY HERE TOO THE DISTINCTIVE BLUE OF THE LABOUR DEPARTMENT WAS IN ABUNDANCE THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE DOUBLE TRACKS
2893-139322-0005 AND BLOTTED OUT THE PICTURE PRESENTLY THEY LEFT THE WAY AND DESCENDED BY A LIFT AND TRAVERSED A PASSAGE THAT SLOPED DOWNWARD AND SO CAME TO A DESCENDING LIFT AGAIN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS CHANGED EVEN THE PRETENCE OF ARCHITECTURAL ORNAMENT DISAPPEARED
2893-139322-0006 THE LIGHTS DIMINISHED IN NUMBER AND SIZE THE ARCHITECTURE BECAME MORE AND MORE MASSIVE IN PROPORTION TO THE SPACES AS THE FACTORY QUARTERS WERE REACHED AND IN THE DUSTY BISCUIT MAKING PLACE OF THE POTTERS AMONG THE FELSPAR MILLS IN THE FURNACE ROOMS OF THE METAL WORKERS
2893-139322-0008 BUT WHEREVER THERE WAS WORK IT WAS BEING DONE BY SLOW MOVING WORKERS IN BLUE CANVAS THE ONLY PEOPLE NOT IN BLUE CANVAS WERE THE OVERLOOKERS OF THE WORK PLACES AND THE ORANGE CLAD LABOUR POLICE AND FRESH FROM THE FLUSHED FACES OF THE DANCING HALLS
2893-139322-0009 THE VOLUNTARY VIGOURS OF THE BUSINESS QUARTER GRAHAM COULD NOTE THE PINCHED FACES THE FEEBLE MUSCLES AND WEARY EYES OF MANY OF THE LATTER DAY WORKERS SUCH AS HE SAW AT WORK WERE NOTICEABLY INFERIOR IN PHYSIQUE TO THE FEW GAILY DRESSED MANAGERS AND FOREWOMEN
2893-139322-0011 THE LATTER DAY LABOURER MALE AS WELL AS FEMALE WAS ESSENTIALLY A MACHINE MINDER AND FEEDER A SERVANT AND ATTENDANT OR AN ARTIST UNDER DIRECTION THE WOMEN IN COMPARISON WITH THOSE GRAHAM REMEMBERED
2893-139322-0012 WERE AS A CLASS DISTINCTLY PLAIN AND FLAT CHESTED TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EMANCIPATION FROM THE MORAL RESTRAINTS OF PURITANICAL RELIGION TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF CITY LIFE HAD DONE THEIR WORK IN ELIMINATING THE STRAIN OF FEMININE BEAUTY AND VIGOUR FROM THE BLUE CANVAS MYRIADS
2893-139322-0014 TO THE EUTHANASY AND PEACE TO BE STEADFAST AGAINST SUCH INDUCEMENTS WAS SCARCELY TO BE EXPECTED OF MEANLY NOURISHED SOULS IN THE YOUNG CITIES OF GRAHAM'S FORMER LIFE THE NEWLY AGGREGATED LABOURING MASS
2893-139322-0015 HAD BEEN A DIVERSE MULTITUDE STILL STIRRED BY THE TRADITION OF PERSONAL HONOUR AND A HIGH MORALITY NOW IT WAS DIFFERENTIATING INTO AN INSTINCT CLASS WITH A MORAL AND PHYSICAL DIFFERENCE OF ITS OWN EVEN WITH A DIALECT OF ITS OWN
2893-139322-0017 THE FACTORIES THAT WERE NOT WORKING WERE SPARSELY LIGHTED TO GRAHAM THEY AND THEIR SHROUDED AISLES OF GIANT MACHINES SEEMED PLUNGED IN GLOOM AND EVEN WHERE WORK WAS GOING ON THE ILLUMINATION WAS FAR LESS BRILLIANT THAN UPON THE PUBLIC WAYS
2893-139322-0018 HE CAME TO THE WARREN OF THE JEWELLERS AND WITH SOME DIFFICULTY AND BY USING HIS SIGNATURE OBTAINED ADMISSION TO THESE GALLERIES THEY WERE HIGH AND DARK AND RATHER COLD IN THE FIRST A FEW MEN WERE MAKING ORNAMENTS OF GOLD FILIGREE
2893-139322-0020 HAD THE ODDEST EFFECT THE WORK WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXECUTED
2893-139322-0021 FOR THE MOST PART INTRICATE GROTESQUES OR THE RINGING OF THE CHANGES ON A GEOMETRICAL MOTIF THESE WORKERS WORE A PECULIAR WHITE UNIFORM WITHOUT POCKETS OR SLEEVES THEY ASSUMED THIS ON COMING TO WORK BUT AT NIGHT
2893-139322-0023 MANY OF THESE WORKERS HAD LIPS AND NOSTRILS A LIVID WHITE DUE TO A DISEASE CAUSED BY A PECULIAR PURPLE ENAMEL THAT CHANCED TO BE MUCH IN FASHION ASANO APOLOGISED TO GRAHAM FOR THIS OFFENSIVE SIGHT BUT EXCUSED HIMSELF ON THE SCORE OF THE CONVENIENCE OF THIS ROUTE
2893-139322-0024 THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE SAID GRAHAM THIS IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE TRYING TO AVOID A START AT A PARTICULARLY STRIKING DISFIGUREMENT SHE MIGHT HAVE DONE BETTER WITH HERSELF THAN THAT SAID ASANO
2893-139322-0026 AND CAME TO A LITTLE BRIDGE THAT SPANNED A VAULT LOOKING OVER THE PARAPET GRAHAM SAW THAT BENEATH WAS A WHARF UNDER YET MORE TREMENDOUS ARCHINGS THAN ANY HE HAD SEEN THREE BARGES SMOTHERED IN FLOURY DUST WERE BEING UNLOADED OF THEIR CARGOES OF POWDERED FELSPAR
2893-139322-0027 BY A MULTITUDE OF COUGHING MEN EACH GUIDING A LITTLE TRUCK THE DUST FILLED THE PLACE WITH A CHOKING MIST AND TURNED THE ELECTRIC GLARE YELLOW THE VAGUE SHADOWS OF THESE WORKERS GESTICULATED ABOUT THEIR FEET AND RUSHED TO AND FRO AGAINST A LONG STRETCH OF WHITE WASHED WALL
2893-139322-0029 THEIR FEET MADE A HOLLOW THUNDER ON THE PLANKS ALONG WHICH THEY WENT TO AND FRO AND AS HE LOOKED AT THIS SCENE SOME HIDDEN VOICE IN THE DARKNESS BEGAN TO SING STOP THAT SHOUTED ONE OF THE POLICEMEN BUT THE ORDER WAS DISOBEYED
2893-139322-0030 AND FIRST ONE AND THEN ALL THE WHITE STAINED MEN WHO WERE WORKING THERE HAD TAKEN UP THE BEATING REFRAIN SINGING IT DEFIANTLY THE SONG OF THE REVOLT THE FEET UPON THE PLANKS THUNDERED NOW TO THE RHYTHM OF THE SONG TRAMP TRAMP TRAMP
2893-139322-0032 THAT WALK LEFT ON GRAHAM'S MIND A MAZE OF MEMORIES FLUCTUATING PICTURES OF SWATHED HALLS AND CROWDED VAULTS SEEN THROUGH CLOUDS OF DUST OF INTRICATE MACHINES THE RACING THREADS OF LOOMS THE HEAVY BEAT OF STAMPING MACHINERY
2893-139322-0033 THE ROAR AND RATTLE OF BELT AND ARMATURE OF ILL LIT SUBTERRANEAN AISLES OF SLEEPING PLACES ILLIMITABLE VISTAS OF PIN POINT LIGHTS HERE WAS THE SMELL OF TANNING AND HERE THE REEK OF A BREWERY
2893-139322-0035 EVEN AS THESE ANEMIC MILLIONS WERE CRUSHED BY ITS COMPLEXITY AND EVERYWHERE WERE PALE FEATURES LEAN LIMBS DISFIGUREMENT AND DEGRADATION ONCE AND AGAIN AND AGAIN A THIRD TIME
2893-139322-0036 GRAHAM HEARD THE SONG OF THE REVOLT DURING HIS LONG UNPLEASANT RESEARCH IN THESE PLACES AND ONCE HE SAW A CONFUSED STRUGGLE DOWN A PASSAGE AND LEARNT THAT A NUMBER OF THESE SERFS HAD SEIZED THEIR BREAD BEFORE THEIR WORK WAS DONE GRAHAM WAS ASCENDING TOWARDS THE WAYS AGAIN
2893-139322-0038 BUT FOR THE MOST PART THIS REMNANT THAT WORKED WORKED HOPELESSLY ALL THE SPIRIT THAT WAS LEFT IN FALLEN HUMANITY WAS ABOVE IN THE STREETS THAT NIGHT CALLING FOR THE MASTER AND VALIANTLY AND NOISILY KEEPING ITS ARMS
2893-139322-0039 THEY EMERGED FROM THESE WANDERINGS AND STOOD BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MIDDLE PASSAGE OF THE PLATFORMS AGAIN THEY BECAME AWARE OF THE REMOTE HOOTING AND YELPING OF THE MACHINES OF ONE OF THE GENERAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICES
2893-139322-0041 THAT MEN YELLED TO ONE ANOTHER THAT WOMEN TOOK UP SCREAMING THAT WAS PASSING LIKE THE FIRST BREEZE OF A THUNDERSTORM CHILL AND SUDDEN THROUGH THE CITY WAS THIS OSTROG HAS ORDERED THE BLACK POLICE TO LONDON THE BLACK POLICE ARE COMING FROM SOUTH AFRICA THE BLACK POLICE THE BLACK POLICE
2893-139322-0042 HE HESITATED LOOKED AT GRAHAM'S FACE AND TOLD HIM THE THING HE ALREADY KNEW BUT HOW CAN THEY KNOW ASKED ASANO GRAHAM HEARD SOMEONE SHOUTING STOP ALL WORK STOP ALL WORK
2893-139322-0044 HE YELLED AN UNSPEAKABLE HORROR THAT THE BLACK POLICE HAD DONE IN PARIS AND SO PASSED SHRIEKING OSTROG THE KNAVE FOR A MOMENT GRAHAM STOOD STILL FOR IT HAD COME UPON HIM AGAIN THAT THESE THINGS WERE A DREAM
2893-139322-0045 HE LOOKED UP AT THE GREAT CLIFF OF BUILDINGS ON EITHER SIDE VANISHING INTO BLUE HAZE AT LAST ABOVE THE LIGHTS AND DOWN TO THE ROARING TIERS OF PLATFORMS AND THE SHOUTING RUNNING PEOPLE WHO WERE GESTICULATING PAST
2893-139322-0047 HE SAID I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN THE HOUR HAS COME HE THOUGHT SWIFTLY WHAT AM I TO DO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL HOUSE SAID ASANO WHY SHOULD I NOT APPEAL THE PEOPLE ARE HERE
2893-139322-0048 YOU WILL LOSE TIME THEY WILL DOUBT IF IT IS YOU BUT THEY WILL MASS ABOUT THE COUNCIL HOUSE THERE YOU WILL FIND THEIR LEADERS YOUR STRENGTH IS THERE WITH THEM SUPPOSE THIS IS ONLY A RUMOUR
2893-139322-0050 EVEN NOW THE RUINS MAY BE IMPASSABLE GRAHAM REGARDED HIM DOUBTFULLY AND FOLLOWED HIM THEY WENT UP THE STEPPED PLATFORMS TO THE SWIFTEST ONE AND THERE ASANO ACCOSTED A LABOURER THE ANSWERS TO HIS QUESTIONS WERE IN THE THICK VULGAR SPEECH WHAT DID HE SAY ASKED GRAHAM
2893-139322-0051 HAD NOT SOMEONE IN THE WIND VANE OFFICES LEARNT HE SAID A GIRL A GIRL NOT HE SAID A GIRL HE DID NOT KNOW WHO SHE WAS WHO CAME OUT FROM THE COUNCIL HOUSE CRYING ALOUD AND TOLD THE MEN AT WORK AMONG THE RUINS
2910-131096-0000 A CERTAIN KING AND QUEEN HAD THREE DAUGHTERS THE CHARMS OF THE TWO ELDER WERE MORE THAN COMMON BUT THE BEAUTY OF THE YOUNGEST WAS SO WONDERFUL THAT THE POVERTY OF LANGUAGE IS UNABLE TO EXPRESS ITS DUE PRAISE THE FAME OF HER BEAUTY WAS SO GREAT
2910-131096-0001 THAT STRANGERS FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES CAME IN CROWDS TO ENJOY THE SIGHT AND LOOKED ON HER WITH AMAZEMENT PAYING HER THAT HOMAGE WHICH IS DUE ONLY TO VENUS HERSELF IN FACT VENUS FOUND HER ALTARS DESERTED
2910-131096-0003 GAVE GREAT OFFENCE TO THE REAL VENUS SHAKING HER AMBROSIAL LOCKS WITH INDIGNATION SHE EXCLAIMED AM I THEN TO BE ECLIPSED IN MY HONORS BY A MORTAL GIRL IN VAIN THEN DID THAT ROYAL SHEPHERD WHOSE JUDGMENT WAS APPROVED BY JOVE HIMSELF
2910-131096-0004 GIVE ME THE PALM OF BEAUTY OVER MY ILLUSTRIOUS RIVALS PALLAS AND JUNO BUT SHE SHALL NOT SO QUIETLY USURP MY HONORS I WILL GIVE HER CAUSE TO REPENT OF SO UNLAWFUL A BEAUTY
2910-131096-0006 INFUSE INTO THE BOSOM OF THAT HAUGHTY GIRL A PASSION FOR SOME LOW MEAN UNWORTHY BEING SO THAT SHE MAY REAP A MORTIFICATION AS GREAT AS HER PRESENT EXULTATION AND TRIUMPH CUPID PREPARED TO OBEY THE COMMANDS OF HIS MOTHER
2910-131096-0007 THERE ARE TWO FOUNTAINS IN VENUS'S GARDEN ONE OF SWEET WATERS THE OTHER OF BITTER CUPID FILLED TWO AMBER VASES ONE FROM EACH FOUNTAIN AND SUSPENDING THEM FROM THE TOP OF HIS QUIVER HASTENED TO THE CHAMBER OF PSYCHE WHOM HE FOUND ASLEEP
2910-131096-0009 WHICH SO STARTLED HIM THAT IN HIS CONFUSION HE WOUNDED HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN ARROW HEEDLESS OF HIS WOUND HIS WHOLE THOUGHT NOW WAS TO REPAIR THE MISCHIEF HE HAD DONE AND HE POURED THE BALMY DROPS OF JOY OVER ALL HER SILKEN RINGLETS
2910-131096-0010 PSYCHE HENCEFORTH FROWNED UPON BY VENUS DERIVED NO BENEFIT FROM ALL HER CHARMS TRUE ALL EYES WERE CAST EAGERLY UPON HER AND EVERY MOUTH SPOKE HER PRAISES
2910-131096-0012 CONSULTED THE ORACLE OF APOLLO AND RECEIVED THIS ANSWER THE VIRGIN IS DESTINED FOR THE BRIDE OF NO MORTAL LOVER HER FUTURE HUSBAND AWAITS HER ON THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN HE IS A MONSTER WHOM NEITHER GODS NOR MEN CAN RESIST
2910-131096-0013 THIS DREADFUL DECREE OF THE ORACLE FILLED ALL THE PEOPLE WITH DISMAY AND HER PARENTS ABANDONED THEMSELVES TO GRIEF BUT PSYCHE SAID WHY MY DEAR PARENTS DO YOU NOW LAMENT ME
2910-131096-0015 ACCORDINGLY ALL THINGS BEING PREPARED THE ROYAL MAID TOOK HER PLACE IN THE PROCESSION WHICH MORE RESEMBLED A FUNERAL THAN A NUPTIAL POMP AND WITH HER PARENTS AMID THE LAMENTATIONS OF THE PEOPLE ASCENDED THE MOUNTAIN
2910-131096-0016 ON THE SUMMIT OF WHICH THEY LEFT HER ALONE AND WITH SORROWFUL HEARTS RETURNED HOME WHILE PSYCHE STOOD ON THE RIDGE OF THE MOUNTAIN PANTING WITH FEAR AND WITH EYES FULL OF TEARS THE GENTLE ZEPHYR RAISED HER FROM THE EARTH
2910-131096-0018 SHE ENTERED IT AND IN THE MIDST DISCOVERED A FOUNTAIN SENDING FORTH CLEAR AND CRYSTAL WATERS AND FAST BY A MAGNIFICENT PALACE WHOSE AUGUST FRONT IMPRESSED THE SPECTATOR THAT IT WAS NOT THE WORK OF MORTAL HANDS
2910-131096-0019 BUT THE HAPPY RETREAT OF SOME GOD DRAWN BY ADMIRATION AND WONDER SHE APPROACHED THE BUILDING AND VENTURED TO ENTER EVERY OBJECT SHE MET FILLED HER WITH PLEASURE AND AMAZEMENT GOLDEN PILLARS SUPPORTED THE VAULTED ROOF
2910-131096-0021 THERE WERE OTHERS FILLED WITH ALL MANNER OF TREASURES AND BEAUTIFUL AND PRECIOUS PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE AND ART WHILE HER EYES WERE THUS OCCUPIED A VOICE ADDRESSED HER THOUGH SHE SAW NO ONE UTTERING THESE WORDS SOVEREIGN LADY
2910-131096-0022 RETIRE THEREFORE TO YOUR CHAMBER AND REPOSE ON YOUR BED OF DOWN AND WHEN YOU SEE FIT REPAIR TO THE BATH SUPPER AWAITS YOU IN THE ADJOINING ALCOVE WHEN IT PLEASES YOU TO TAKE YOUR SEAT THERE PSYCHE GAVE EAR TO THE ADMONITIONS OF HER VOCAL ATTENDANTS
2910-131096-0024 HER EARS TOO WERE FEASTED WITH MUSIC FROM INVISIBLE PERFORMERS OF WHOM ONE SANG ANOTHER PLAYED ON THE LUTE AND ALL CLOSED IN THE WONDERFUL HARMONY OF A FULL CHORUS SHE HAD NOT YET SEEN HER DESTINED HUSBAND
2910-131096-0025 BUT HIS ACCENTS WERE FULL OF LOVE AND INSPIRED A LIKE PASSION IN HER SHE OFTEN BEGGED HIM TO STAY AND LET HER BEHOLD HIM BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT ON THE CONTRARY HE CHARGED HER TO MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE HIM
2910-131096-0027 BUT ALL I ASK OF YOU IS TO LOVE ME I WOULD RATHER YOU WOULD LOVE ME AS AN EQUAL THAN ADORE ME AS A GOD THIS REASONING SOMEWHAT QUIETED PSYCHE FOR A TIME AND WHILE THE NOVELTY LASTED SHE FELT QUITE HAPPY
2910-131096-0028 BUT AT LENGTH THE THOUGHT OF HER PARENTS LEFT IN IGNORANCE OF HER FATE
2910-131096-0030 SO CALLING ZEPHYR SHE ACQUAINTED HIM WITH HER HUSBAND'S COMMANDS AND HE PROMPTLY OBEDIENT SOON BROUGHT THEM ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO THEIR SISTER'S VALLEY THEY EMBRACED HER AND SHE RETURNED THEIR CARESSES COME SAID PSYCHE
2910-131096-0031 ENTER WITH ME MY HOUSE AND REFRESH YOURSELVES WITH WHATEVER YOUR SISTER HAS TO OFFER THEN TAKING THEIR HANDS SHE LED THEM INTO HER GOLDEN PALACE AND COMMITTED THEM TO THE CARE OF HER NUMEROUS TRAIN OF ATTENDANT VOICES TO REFRESH THEM IN HER BATHS
2910-131096-0033 THEY ASKED HER NUMBERLESS QUESTIONS AMONG OTHERS WHAT SORT OF A PERSON HER HUSBAND WAS PSYCHE REPLIED THAT HE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WHO GENERALLY SPENT THE DAYTIME IN HUNTING UPON THE MOUNTAINS THE SISTERS NOT SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY
2910-131096-0034 SOON MADE HER CONFESS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM THEN THEY PROCEEDED TO FILL HER BOSOM WITH DARK SUSPICIONS CALL TO MIND THEY SAID
2910-131096-0036 PUT THEM IN CONCEALMENT THAT YOUR HUSBAND MAY NOT DISCOVER THEM AND WHEN HE IS SOUND ASLEEP SLIP OUT OF BED BRING FORTH YOUR LAMP AND SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER WHAT THEY SAY IS TRUE OR NOT IF IT IS HESITATE NOT TO CUT OFF THE MONSTER'S HEAD AND THEREBY RECOVER YOUR LIBERTY
2910-131096-0037 PSYCHE RESISTED THESE PERSUASIONS AS WELL AS SHE COULD BUT THEY DID NOT FAIL TO HAVE THEIR EFFECT ON HER MIND AND WHEN HER SISTERS WERE GONE THEIR WORDS AND HER OWN CURIOSITY WERE TOO STRONG FOR HER TO RESIST SO SHE PREPARED HER LAMP
2910-131096-0039 WITH TWO DEWY WINGS ON HIS SHOULDERS WHITER THAN SNOW AND WITH SHINING FEATHERS LIKE THE TENDER BLOSSOMS OF SPRING AS SHE LEANED THE LAMP OVER TO HAVE A NEARER VIEW OF HIS FACE A DROP OF BURNING OIL FELL ON THE SHOULDER OF THE GOD
2910-131096-0040 STARTLED WITH WHICH HE OPENED HIS EYES AND FIXED THEM FULL UPON HER THEN WITHOUT SAYING ONE WORD HE SPREAD HIS WHITE WINGS AND FLEW OUT OF THE WINDOW PSYCHE IN VAIN ENDEAVORING TO FOLLOW HIM FELL FROM THE WINDOW TO THE GROUND
2910-131096-0042 BUT GO RETURN TO YOUR SISTERS WHOSE ADVICE YOU SEEM TO THINK PREFERABLE TO MINE I INFLICT NO OTHER PUNISHMENT ON YOU THAN TO LEAVE YOU FOREVER LOVE CANNOT DWELL WITH SUSPICION SO SAYING HE FLED AWAY LEAVING POOR PSYCHE PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND
2910-131096-0043 FILLING THE PLACE WITH MOURNFUL LAMENTATIONS WHEN SHE HAD RECOVERED SOME DEGREE OF COMPOSURE SHE LOOKED AROUND HER BUT THE PALACE AND GARDENS HAD VANISHED AND SHE FOUND HERSELF IN THE OPEN FIELD NOT FAR FROM THE CITY WHERE HER SISTERS DWELT
2910-131096-0045 AND DIRECTED HER STEPS THITHER SHE HAD NO SOONER ENTERED THAN SHE SAW HEAPS OF CORN SOME IN LOOSE EARS AND SOME IN SHEAVES WITH MINGLED EARS OF BARLEY
2910-131096-0046 SCATTERED ABOUT LAY SICKLES AND RAKES AND ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF HARVEST WITHOUT ORDER AS IF THROWN CARELESSLY OUT OF THE WEARY REAPERS HANDS IN THE SULTRY HOURS OF THE DAY THIS UNSEEMLY CONFUSION
2910-131096-0048 TO ENGAGE THEM ALL IN HER BEHALF THE HOLY CERES WHOSE TEMPLE IT WAS FINDING HER SO RELIGIOUSLY EMPLOYED THUS SPOKE TO HER O PSYCHE TRULY WORTHY OF OUR PITY THOUGH I CANNOT SHIELD YOU FROM THE FROWNS OF VENUS
2910-131096-0049 YET I CAN TEACH YOU HOW BEST TO ALLAY HER DISPLEASURE GO THEN AND VOLUNTARILY SURRENDER YOURSELF TO YOUR LADY AND SOVEREIGN AND TRY BY MODESTY AND SUBMISSION TO WIN HER FORGIVENESS AND PERHAPS HER FAVOR WILL RESTORE YOU THE HUSBAND YOU HAVE LOST
2910-131096-0051 MOST UNDUTIFUL AND FAITHLESS OF SERVANTS SAID SHE DO YOU AT LAST REMEMBER THAT YOU REALLY HAVE A MISTRESS OR HAVE YOU RATHER COME TO SEE YOUR SICK HUSBAND YET LAID UP OF THE WOUND GIVEN HIM BY HIS LOVING WIFE YOU ARE SO ILL FAVORED AND DISAGREEABLE
2910-131096-0052 THAT THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN MERIT YOUR LOVER MUST BE BY DINT OF INDUSTRY AND DILIGENCE I WILL MAKE TRIAL OF YOUR HOUSEWIFERY THEN SHE ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE LED TO THE STOREHOUSE OF HER TEMPLE
2910-131096-0054 AND SEE THAT YOU GET IT DONE BEFORE EVENING THEN VENUS DEPARTED AND LEFT HER TO HER TASK BUT PSYCHE IN A PERFECT CONSTERNATION AT THE ENORMOUS WORK SAT STUPID AND SILENT WITHOUT MOVING A FINGER TO THE INEXTRICABLE HEAP
2910-131096-0055 WHILE SHE SAT DESPAIRING CUPID STIRRED UP THE LITTLE ANT A NATIVE OF THE FIELDS TO TAKE COMPASSION ON HER THE LEADER OF THE ANT HILL FOLLOWED BY WHOLE HOSTS OF HIS SIX LEGGED SUBJECTS
2910-131096-0057 VENUS AT THE APPROACH OF TWILIGHT RETURNED FROM THE BANQUET OF THE GODS BREATHING ODORS AND CROWNED WITH ROSES SEEING THE TASK DONE SHE EXCLAIMED THIS IS NO WORK OF YOURS WICKED ONE
2910-131096-0058 SO SAYING SHE THREW HER A PIECE OF BLACK BREAD FOR HER SUPPER AND WENT AWAY NEXT MORNING VENUS ORDERED PSYCHE TO BE CALLED AND SAID TO HER BEHOLD YONDER GROVE WHICH STRETCHES ALONG THE MARGIN OF THE WATER
2910-131096-0060 PSYCHE OBEDIENTLY WENT TO THE RIVERSIDE PREPARED TO DO HER BEST TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND BUT THE RIVER GOD INSPIRED THE REEDS WITH HARMONIOUS MURMURS WHICH SEEMED TO SAY O MAIDEN SEVERELY TRIED TEMPT NOT THE DANGEROUS FLOOD
2910-131096-0061 NOR VENTURE AMONG THE FORMIDABLE RAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE RISING SUN THEY BURN WITH A CRUEL RAGE TO DESTROY MORTALS WITH THEIR SHARP HORNS OR RUDE TEETH BUT WHEN THE NOONTIDE SUN HAS DRIVEN THE CATTLE TO THE SHADE
2910-131096-0063 AND BY OBSERVING HIS DIRECTIONS SHE SOON RETURNED TO VENUS WITH HER ARMS FULL OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE BUT SHE RECEIVED NOT THE APPROBATION OF HER IMPLACABLE MISTRESS WHO SAID I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS BY NONE OF YOUR OWN DOINGS THAT YOU HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS TASK
2910-131096-0064 AND I AM NOT SATISFIED YET THAT YOU HAVE ANY CAPACITY TO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL BUT I HAVE ANOTHER TASK FOR YOU HERE TAKE THIS BOX AND GO YOUR WAY TO THE INFERNAL SHADES AND GIVE THIS BOX TO PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0066 PSYCHE WAS NOW SATISFIED THAT HER DESTRUCTION WAS AT HAND BEING OBLIGED TO GO WITH HER OWN FEET DIRECTLY DOWN TO EREBUS WHEREFORE TO MAKE NO DELAY OF WHAT WAS NOT TO BE AVOIDED
2910-131096-0067 SHE GOES TO THE TOP OF A HIGH TOWER TO PRECIPITATE HERSELF HEADLONG THUS TO DESCEND THE SHORTEST WAY TO THE SHADES BELOW BUT A VOICE FROM THE TOWER SAID TO HER WHY POOR UNLUCKY GIRL DOST THOU DESIGN TO PUT AN END TO THY DAYS IN SO DREADFUL A MANNER
2910-131096-0069 BUT THE VOICE ADDED WHEN PROSERPINE HAS GIVEN YOU THE BOX FILLED WITH HER BEAUTY OF ALL THINGS THIS IS CHIEFLY TO BE OBSERVED BY YOU
2910-131096-0070 PSYCHE ENCOURAGED BY THIS ADVICE OBEYED IT IN ALL THINGS AND TAKING HEED TO HER WAYS TRAVELLED SAFELY TO THE KINGDOM OF PLUTO SHE WAS ADMITTED TO THE PALACE OF PROSERPINE
2910-131096-0072 THEN SHE RETURNED THE WAY SHE CAME AND GLAD WAS SHE TO COME OUT ONCE MORE INTO THE LIGHT OF DAY BUT HAVING GOT SO FAR SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH HER DANGEROUS TASK A LONGING DESIRE SEIZED HER TO EXAMINE THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX
2910-131096-0073 WHAT SAID SHE SHALL I THE CARRIER OF THIS DIVINE BEAUTY NOT TAKE THE LEAST BIT TO PUT ON MY CHEEKS TO APPEAR TO MORE ADVANTAGE IN THE EYES OF MY BELOVED HUSBAND SO SHE CAREFULLY OPENED THE BOX BUT FOUND NOTHING THERE OF ANY BEAUTY AT ALL
2910-131096-0075 AND NOT ABLE LONGER TO BEAR THE ABSENCE OF HIS BELOVED PSYCHE SLIPPING THROUGH THE SMALLEST CRACK OF THE WINDOW OF HIS CHAMBER WHICH HAPPENED TO BE LEFT OPEN FLEW TO THE SPOT WHERE PSYCHE LAY
2910-131096-0076 AND GATHERING UP THE SLEEP FROM HER BODY CLOSED IT AGAIN IN THE BOX AND WAKED PSYCHE WITH A LIGHT TOUCH OF ONE OF HIS ARROWS AGAIN SAID HE HAST THOU ALMOST PERISHED BY THE SAME CURIOSITY
2910-131096-0078 AND PLEADED THE CAUSE OF THE LOVERS SO EARNESTLY WITH VENUS THAT HE WON HER CONSENT ON THIS HE SENT MERCURY TO BRING PSYCHE UP TO THE HEAVENLY ASSEMBLY AND WHEN SHE ARRIVED HANDING HER A CUP OF AMBROSIA HE SAID DRINK THIS PSYCHE AND BE IMMORTAL
2910-131096-0079 NOR SHALL CUPID EVER BREAK AWAY FROM THE KNOT IN WHICH HE IS TIED BUT THESE NUPTIALS SHALL BE PERPETUAL THUS PSYCHE BECAME AT LAST UNITED TO CUPID AND IN DUE TIME THEY HAD A DAUGHTER BORN TO THEM WHOSE NAME WAS PLEASURE
2910-131096-0081 BURSTING ON BRILLIANT WINGS FROM THE TOMB IN WHICH IT HAS LAIN AFTER A DULL GROVELLING CATERPILLAR EXISTENCE TO FLUTTER IN THE BLAZE OF DAY AND FEED ON THE MOST FRAGRANT AND DELICATE PRODUCTIONS OF THE SPRING PSYCHE THEN IS THE HUMAN SOUL
2910-131096-0082 WHICH IS PURIFIED BY SUFFERINGS AND MISFORTUNES AND IS THUS PREPARED FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF TRUE AND PURE HAPPINESS IN WORKS OF ART PSYCHE IS REPRESENTED AS A MAIDEN WITH THE WINGS OF A BUTTERFLY ALONG WITH CUPID
2910-131096-0084 AFTER HER WANDERING LABORS LONG TILL FREE CONSENT THE GODS AMONG MAKE HER HIS ETERNAL BRIDE AND FROM HER FAIR UNSPOTTED SIDE TWO BLISSFUL TWINS ARE TO BE BORN YOUTH AND JOY SO JOVE HATH SWORN
2910-131096-0085 THE ALLEGORY OF THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE IS WELL PRESENTED IN THE BEAUTIFUL LINES OF T K HARVEY THEY WOVE BRIGHT FABLES IN THE DAYS OF OLD WHEN REASON BORROWED FANCY'S PAINTED WINGS
2910-131096-0087 THROUGH THE DIM GROTTO'S TRACERY OF SPARS MID THE PINE TEMPLES ON THE MOONLIT MOUNT WHERE SILENCE SITS TO LISTEN TO THE STARS IN THE DEEP GLADE WHERE DWELLS THE BROODING DOVE THE PAINTED VALLEY AND THE SCENTED AIR
2910-131096-0088 SHE HEARD FAR ECHOES OF THE VOICE OF LOVE AND FOUND HIS FOOTSTEPS TRACES EVERYWHERE BUT NEVERMORE THEY MET SINCE DOUBTS AND FEARS THOSE PHANTOM SHAPES THAT HAUNT AND BLIGHT THE EARTH HAD COME TWIXT HER A CHILD OF SIN AND TEARS
2910-131096-0090 THE STORY OF CUPID AND PSYCHE FIRST APPEARS IN THE WORKS OF APULEIUS A WRITER OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA IT IS THEREFORE OF MUCH MORE RECENT DATE THAN MOST OF THE LEGENDS OF THE AGE OF FABLE IT IS THIS THAT KEATS ALLUDES TO IN HIS ODE TO PSYCHE
2910-131096-0091 O LATEST BORN AND LOVELIEST VISION FAR OF ALL OLYMPUS FADED HIERARCHY FAIRER THAN PHOEBE'S SAPPHIRE REGIONED STAR OR VESPER AMOROUS GLOW WORM OF THE SKY FAIRER THAN THESE THOUGH TEMPLE THOU HAST NONE
2910-131096-0093 OF PALE MOUTHED PROPHET DREAMING IN MOORE'S SUMMER FETE A FANCY BALL IS DESCRIBED IN WHICH ONE OF THE CHARACTERS PERSONATED IS PSYCHE NOT IN DARK DISGUISE TO NIGHT HATH OUR YOUNG HEROINE VEILED HER LIGHT
2910-131096-0094 FOR SEE SHE WALKS THE EARTH LOVE'S OWN HIS WEDDED BRIDE BY HOLIEST VOW PLEDGED IN OLYMPUS AND MADE KNOWN TO MORTALS BY THE TYPE WHICH NOW HANGS GLITTERING ON HER SNOWY BROW
2911-7601-0001 ABOVE ALL WAS THE SENSE OF HEARING ACUTE I HEARD ALL THINGS IN THE HEAVEN
2911-7601-0002 I HEARD MANY THINGS IN HELL HOW THEN AM I MAD HEARKEN AND OBSERVE HOW HEALTHILY HOW CALMLY I CAN TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW FIRST THE IDEA ENTERED MY BRAIN BUT ONCE CONCEIVED
2911-7601-0004 YES IT WAS THIS HE HAD THE EYE OF A VULTURE A PALE BLUE EYE WITH A FILM OVER IT WHENEVER IT FELL UPON ME MY BLOOD RAN COLD AND SO BY DEGREES VERY GRADUALLY
2911-7601-0005 I MADE UP MY MIND TO TAKE THE LIFE OF THE OLD MAN AND THUS RID MYSELF OF THE EYE FOREVER NOW THIS IS THE POINT YOU FANCY ME MAD MADMEN KNOW NOTHING BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HOW WISELY I PROCEEDED
2911-7601-0007 OH SO GENTLY AND THEN WHEN I HAD MADE AN OPENING SUFFICIENT FOR MY HEAD I PUT IN A DARK LANTERN ALL CLOSED CLOSED THAT NO LIGHT SHONE OUT AND THEN I THRUST IN MY HEAD
2911-7601-0008 OH YOU WOULD HAVE LAUGHED TO SEE HOW CUNNINGLY I THRUST IT IN I MOVED IT SLOWLY VERY VERY SLOWLY SO THAT I MIGHT NOT DISTURB THE OLD MAN'S SLEEP IT TOOK ME AN HOUR TO PLACE MY WHOLE HEAD WITHIN THE OPENING
2911-7601-0010 FOR IT WAS NOT THE OLD MAN WHO VEXED ME BUT HIS EVIL EYE AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE DAY BROKE I WENT BOLDLY INTO THE CHAMBER AND SPOKE COURAGEOUSLY TO HIM CALLING HIM BY NAME IN A HEARTY TONE AND INQUIRING HOW HE HAS PASSED THE NIGHT
2911-7601-0011 SO YOU SEE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY PROFOUND OLD MAN INDEED TO SUSPECT THAT EVERY NIGHT JUST AT TWELVE I LOOKED IN UPON HIM WHILE HE SLEPT UPON THE EIGHTH NIGHT I WAS MORE THAN USUALLY CAUTIOUS IN OPENING THE DOOR
2911-7601-0013 AND HE NOT EVEN TO DREAM OF MY SECRET DEEDS OR THOUGHTS I FAIRLY CHUCKLED AT THE IDEA AND PERHAPS HE HEARD ME FOR HE MOVED ON THE BED SUDDENLY AS IF STARTLED NOW YOU MAY THINK THAT I DREW BACK BUT NO
2911-7601-0014 HIS ROOM WAS AS BLACK AS PITCH WITH THE THICK DARKNESS FOR THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSE FASTENED THROUGH FEAR OF ROBBERS AND SO I KNEW THAT HE COULD NOT SEE THE OPENING OF THE DOOR
2911-7601-0016 FOR A WHOLE HOUR I DID NOT MOVE A MUSCLE AND IN THE MEANTIME I DID NOT HEAR HIM LIE DOWN HE WAS STILL SITTING UP IN THE BED LISTENING JUST AS I HAVE DONE NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HEARKENING TO THE DEATH WATCHES IN THE WALL
2911-7601-0017 PRESENTLY I HEARD A SLIGHT GROAN AND I KNEW IT WAS THE GROAN OF MORTAL TERROR IT WAS NOT A GROAN OF PAIN OR OF GRIEF OH NO
2911-7601-0019 DEEPENING WITH ITS DREADFUL ECHO THE TERRORS THAT DISTRACTED ME I SAY I KNEW IT WELL I KNEW WHAT THE OLD MAN FELT AND PITIED HIM ALTHOUGH I CHUCKLED AT HEART
2911-7601-0020 WHEN HE HAD TURNED IN THE BED HIS FEARS HAD BEEN EVER SINCE GROWING UPON HIM HE HAD BEEN TRYING TO FANCY THEM CAUSELESS BUT COULD NOT HE HAD BEEN SAYING TO HIMSELF IT IS NOTHING BUT THE WIND IN THE CHIMNEY
2911-7601-0022 IN APPROACHING HIM HAD STALKED WITH HIS BLACK SHADOW BEFORE HIM AND ENVELOPED THE VICTIM AND IT WAS THE MOURNFUL INFLUENCE OF THE UNPERCEIVED SHADOW THAT CAUSED HIM TO FEEL ALTHOUGH HE NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD TO FEEL THE PRESENCE OF MY HEAD WITHIN THE ROOM
2911-7601-0023 WHEN I HAD WAITED A LONG TIME VERY PATIENTLY WITHOUT HEARING HIM LIE DOWN I RESOLVED TO OPEN A LITTLE A VERY VERY LITTLE CREVICE IN THE LANTERN SO I OPENED IT YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW STEALTHILY
2911-7601-0025 AND FELL FULL UPON THE VULTURE EYE IT WAS OPEN WIDE WIDE OPEN AND I GREW FURIOUS AS I GAZED UPON IT I SAW IT WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS ALL A DULL BLUE
2911-7601-0026 WITH A HIDEOUS VEIL OVER IT THAT CHILLED THE VERY MARROW IN MY BONES BUT I COULD SEE NOTHING ELSE OF THE OLD MAN'S FACE OR PERSON FOR I HAD DIRECTED THE RAY AS IF BY INSTINCT PRECISELY UPON THE DAMNED SPOT
2911-7601-0028 SUCH AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I KNEW THAT SOUND WELL TOO IT WAS THE BEATING OF THE OLD MAN'S HEART IT INCREASED MY FURY AS THE BEATING OF A DRUM STIMULATES THE SOLDIER INTO COURAGE
2911-7601-0029 BUT EVEN YET I REFRAINED AND KEPT STILL I SCARCELY BREATHED I HELD THE LANTERN MOTIONLESS I TRIED HOW STEADILY I COULD MAINTAIN THE RAY
2911-7601-0031 DO YOU MARK ME WELL I HAVE TOLD YOU THAT I AM NERVOUS SO I AM AND NOW AT THE DEAD HOUR OF THE NIGHT AMID THE DREADFUL SILENCE OF THAT OLD HOUSE SO STRANGE A NOISE AS THIS EXCITED ME TO UNCONTROLLABLE TERROR
2911-7601-0032 YET FOR SOME MINUTES LONGER I REFRAINED AND STOOD STILL BUT THE BEATING GREW LOUDER LOUDER I THOUGHT THE HEART MUST BURST AND NOW A NEW ANXIETY SEIZED ME THE SOUND WOULD BE HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR THE OLD MAN'S HOUR HAD COME
2911-7601-0034 TO FIND THE DEED SO FAR DONE BUT FOR MANY MINUTES THE HEART BEAT ON WITH A MUFFLED SOUND THIS HOWEVER DID NOT VEX ME IT WOULD NOT BE HEARD THROUGH THE WALL AT LENGTH IT CEASED THE OLD MAN WAS DEAD
2911-7601-0035 I REMOVED THE BED AND EXAMINED THE CORPSE YES HE WAS STONE STONE DEAD I PLACED MY HAND UPON THE HEART AND HELD IT THERE MANY MINUTES THERE WAS NO PULSATION HE WAS STONE DEAD HIS EYE WOULD TROUBLE ME NO MORE
2911-7601-0037 AND DEPOSITED ALL BETWEEN THE SCANTLINGS I THEN REPLACED THE BOARDS SO CLEVERLY SO CUNNINGLY THAT NO HUMAN EYE NOT EVEN HIS COULD HAVE DETECTED ANY THING WRONG THERE WAS NOTHING TO WASH OUT NO STAIN OF ANY KIND
2911-7601-0038 NO BLOOD SPOT WHATEVER I HAD BEEN TOO WARY FOR THAT A TUB HAD CAUGHT ALL HA HA
2911-7601-0040 WITH PERFECT SUAVITY AS OFFICERS OF THE POLICE A SHRIEK HAD BEEN HEARD BY A NEIGHBOUR DURING THE NIGHT SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY HAD BEEN AROUSED INFORMATION HAD BEEN LODGED AT THE POLICE OFFICE AND THEY THE OFFICERS
2911-7601-0041 HAD BEEN DEPUTED TO SEARCH THE PREMISES I SMILED FOR WHAT HAD I TO FEAR I BADE THE GENTLEMEN WELCOME THE SHRIEK I SAID WAS MY OWN IN A DREAM THE OLD MAN I MENTIONED WAS ABSENT IN THE COUNTRY
2911-7601-0043 PLACED MY OWN SEAT UPON THE VERY SPOT BENEATH WHICH REPOSED THE CORPSE OF THE VICTIM THE OFFICERS WERE SATISFIED MY MANNER HAD CONVINCED THEM I WAS SINGULARLY AT EASE THEY SAT AND WHILE I ANSWERED CHEERILY
2911-7601-0044 THEY CHATTED OF FAMILIAR THINGS BUT ERE LONG I FELT MYSELF GETTING PALE AND WISHED THEM GONE MY HEAD ACHED AND I FANCIED A RINGING IN MY EARS BUT STILL THEY SAT AND STILL CHATTED THE RINGING BECAME MORE DISTINCT IT CONTINUED
2911-7601-0046 AND WITH A HEIGHTENED VOICE YET THE SOUND INCREASED AND WHAT COULD I DO IT WAS A LOW DULL QUICK SOUND MUCH SUCH A SOUND AS A WATCH MAKES WHEN ENVELOPED IN COTTON I GASPED FOR BREATH AND YET THE OFFICERS HEARD IT NOT
2911-7601-0047 I TALKED MORE QUICKLY MORE VEHEMENTLY BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED I AROSE AND ARGUED ABOUT TRIFLES IN A HIGH KEY AND WITH VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS BUT THE NOISE STEADILY INCREASED WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE GONE
2911-7601-0049 I SWUNG THE CHAIR UPON WHICH I HAD BEEN SITTING AND GRATED IT UPON THE BOARDS BUT THE NOISE AROSE OVER ALL AND CONTINUALLY INCREASED IT GREW LOUDER LOUDER LOUDER AND STILL THE MEN CHATTED PLEASANTLY AND SMILED
2911-7601-0050 WAS IT POSSIBLE THEY HEARD NOT ALMIGHTY GOD NO NO THEY HEARD THEY SUSPECTED THEY KNEW THEY WERE MAKING A MOCKERY OF MY HORROR THIS I THOUGHT AND THIS I THINK
2911-12359-0000 FIT FOR DRINK A COUNTRY WITHOUT A FIT DRINK FOR CHEESE HAS NO CHEESE FIT FOR DRINK GREECE WAS THE FIRST COUNTRY TO PROVE ITS EPICUREAN FITNESS ACCORDING TO THE OLD SAYING ABOVE FOR IT HAD WINE TO TIPPLE
2911-12359-0001 AND SHEEP'S MILK CHEESE TO NIBBLE THE CLASSICAL GREEK CHEESE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FETA AND NO DOUBT THIS WAS THE KIND
2911-12359-0003 CHEESE IS ON THE HOUSE AT ALL WINE SALES FOR PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS TO SNACK UPON AND THUS BRING OUT THE FULL FLAVOR OF THE CELLARED VINTAGES BUT PROFESSIONAL WINE TASTERS ARE FORBIDDEN ANY CHEESE BETWEEN SIPS
2911-12359-0004 THEY MAY CLEAR THEIR PALATES WITH PLAIN BREAD BUT NARY A CRUMB OF ROQUEFORT OR CUBE OF GRUYERE IN WORKING HOURS LEST IT GIVE THE WINE A SPURIOUS NOBILITY AND SPEAKING OF ROQUEFORT
2911-12359-0006 AND DE BAUNE AND BURGUNDIAN CHEESES SUCH AS
2911-12359-0007 AND PORT SALUT SEEM TO BE MADE FOR EACH OTHER AS DO CHATEAU MARGAUX
2911-12359-0009 VENDOME AND THE LOIRE WINES VOUVRAY
2911-12359-0010 AND ANJOU GRUYERE MATES WITH CHABLIS
2911-12359-0012 THEN THERE IS A MOST UNUSUAL PAIR FRENCH NEUFCHATEL CHEESE AND SWISS NEUCHATEL WINE FROM JUST ACROSS THE BORDER SWITZERLAND ALSO HAS ANOTHER CHEESE FAVORITE AT HOME
2911-12359-0013 GRAPE CHEESE NAMED FROM THE NEUCHATEL WINE IN WHICH IT IS AGED
2911-12359-0015 THAT ARE PACKED IN MINIATURE WINE BARRELS STRONGLY SUGGESTING WHAT SHOULD BE DRUNK WITH SUCH EXCELLENT CHEESES HUNGARIAN TOKAY OTHER FOREIGN CHEESES GO TO MARKET WRAPPED IN VINE LEAVES THE AFFINITY HAS CLEARLY BEEN LAID DOWN IN HEAVEN
2911-12359-0016 ONLY THE ENGLISH SEEM TO HAVE A FORTISSIMO TASTE IN THE GO WITH WINES ACCORDING TO THESE MATCHES REGISTERED BY ANDRE SIMON IN THE ART OF GOOD LIVING RED CHESHIRE WITH LIGHT TAWNY PORT WHITE CHESHIRE
2911-12359-0018 WITH NIPS OF AMONTILLADO FOR AN ELOQUENT APPETIZER THE ENGLISH ALSO POUR PORT INTO STILTON AND SUNDRY OTHER WINES AND LIQUORS INTO CHEDDARS AND SUCH THIS DOCTORING LEADS TO FRAUDULENT IMITATION HOWEVER
2911-12359-0019 FOR EITHER PORT OR STOUT IS PUT INTO COUNTERFEIT CHESHIRE CHEESE TO MAKE UP FOR THE RICHNESS IT LACKS WHILE SOME COMBINATIONS OF CHEESES AND WINES MAY TURN OUT PALATABLE WE PREFER TAKING OURS STRAIGHT WHEN SOMETHING MORE FIERY IS NEEDED
2911-12359-0021 WAS A FAVORITE LIQUEUR OF CHEESE LOVING FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT AND WE CAN BE SURE HE TOOK THE TWO SEPARATELY ANOTHER PERFECT COMBINATION IF YOU CAN TAKE IT
2911-12359-0022 WITH ANY CARAWAY SEEDED CHEESE OR CREAM CHEESE WITH A HANDY SAUCER OF CARAWAY SEEDS IN THE SECTION OF FRANCE DEVOTED TO GIN THE JUNIPER BERRIES THAT FLAVOR THE DRINK ALSO GO INTO A LOCAL CHEESE FROMAGE FORT
2911-12359-0024 FARMERS ALSO DRINK HOMEMADE CIDER
2911-12359-0025 THE ENGLISH SIP PEAR CIDER PERRY WITH ALMOST ANY BRITISH CHEESE MILK WOULD SEEM TO BE REDUNDANT BUT SAGE CHEESE AND BUTTERMILK DO GO WELL TOGETHER
2911-15045-0001 MUTABLE AS THE WIND IN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN SECTION OF THE UNITED STATES THE ELEMENTS OF CHANGE WERE ESPECIALLY ACTIVE THE INDIAN POPULATION WHICH IN FIFTEEN THIRTY FIVE CARTIER FOUND AT MONTREAL AND QUEBEC
2911-15045-0002 HAD DISAPPEARED AT THE OPENING OF THE NEXT CENTURY AND ANOTHER RACE HAD SUCCEEDED IN LANGUAGE AND CUSTOMS WIDELY DIFFERENT WHILE IN THE REGION NOW FORMING THE STATE OF NEW YORK A POWER WAS RISING TO A FEROCIOUS VITALITY WHICH
2911-15045-0004 AND FROM THE CAROLINAS TO HUDSON'S BAY WAS DIVIDED BETWEEN TWO GREAT FAMILIES OF TRIBES DISTINGUISHED BY A RADICAL DIFFERENCE OF LANGUAGE A PART OF VIRGINIA AND OF PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY SOUTHEASTERN NEW YORK NEW ENGLAND
2911-15045-0005 NEW BRUNSWICK NOVA SCOTIA AND LOWER CANADA WERE OCCUPIED SO FAR AS OCCUPIED AT ALL BY TRIBES SPEAKING VARIOUS ALGONQUIN LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS THEY EXTENDED MOREOVER ALONG THE SHORES OF THE UPPER LAKES
2911-15045-0007 ON THE WHOLE THESE SAVAGES WERE FAVORABLE SPECIMENS OF THE ALGONQUIN STOCK BELONGING TO THAT SECTION OF IT WHICH TILLED THE SOIL AND WAS THUS IN SOME MEASURE SPARED THE EXTREMES OF MISERY AND DEGRADATION
2911-15045-0008 TO WHICH THE WANDERING HUNTER TRIBES WERE OFTEN REDUCED THEY OWED MUCH ALSO TO THE BOUNTY OF THE SEA AND HENCE THEY TENDED TOWARDS THE COAST WHICH BEFORE THE EPIDEMIC CHAMPLAIN AND SMITH HAD SEEN AT MANY POINTS STUDDED WITH WIGWAMS
2911-15045-0010 FLYING IN TERROR AT THE SOUND OF THE MOHAWK WAR CRY WESTWARD THE POPULATION THINNED RAPIDLY NORTHWARD IT SOON DISAPPEARED NORTHERN NEW HAMPSHIRE THE WHOLE OF VERMONT AND WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS HAD NO HUMAN TENANTS BUT THE ROVING HUNTER
2911-15045-0011 OR PROWLING WARRIOR WE HAVE SAID THAT THIS GROUP OF TRIBES WAS RELATIVELY VERY POPULOUS YET IT IS MORE THAN DOUBTFUL WHETHER ALL OF THEM UNITED HAD UNION BEEN POSSIBLE COULD HAVE MUSTERED EIGHT THOUSAND FIGHTING MEN TO SPEAK FURTHER OF THEM IS NEEDLESS
2911-15045-0013 TO WHOM AGRICULTURE WAS UNKNOWN THOUGH THE SEA PROLIFIC OF FISH LOBSTERS AND SEALS GREATLY LIGHTENED THEIR MISERIES
2911-15045-0014 OR MICMACS OF NOVA SCOTIA CLOSELY RESEMBLED THEM IN HABITS AND CONDITION FROM NOVA SCOTIA TO THE SAINT LAWRENCE THERE WAS NO POPULATION WORTHY OF THE NAME FROM THE GULF OF SAINT LAWRENCE TO LAKE ONTARIO THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE GREAT RIVER
2911-15045-0016 WHEN IN SPRING THE FRENCH TRADING SHIPS ARRIVED AND ANCHORED IN THE PORT OF TADOUSSAC THEY GATHERED FROM FAR AND NEAR TOILING PAINFULLY THROUGH THE DESOLATION OF FORESTS MUSTERING BY HUNDREDS AT THE POINT OF TRAFFIC
2911-15045-0017 AND SETTING UP THEIR BARK WIGWAMS ALONG THE STRAND OF THAT WILD HARBOR
2911-15045-0019 AND IN EXTREMITY EVEN CANNIBALISM WAS NOT RARE AMONG THEM ASCENDING THE SAINT LAWRENCE IT WAS SELDOM THAT THE SIGHT OF A HUMAN FORM GAVE RELIEF TO THE LONELINESS
2911-15045-0020 FROM THE VERGE OF THE CLIFF ANNOUNCED THAT THE SAVAGE PROLOGUE OF THE AMERICAN DRAMA WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE AND THAT THE CIVILIZATION OF EUROPE WAS ADVANCING ON THE SCENE ASCENDING FARTHER ALL WAS SOLITUDE EXCEPT AT THREE RIVERS
2911-15045-0022 AND AS THE VOYAGER PASSED SOME WOODED POINT OR THICKET COVERED ISLAND THE WHISTLING OF A STONE HEADED ARROW PROCLAIMED PERHAPS THE PRESENCE OF THESE FIERCE MARAUDERS AT MONTREAL THERE WAS NO HUMAN LIFE SAVE DURING A BRIEF SPACE IN EARLY SUMMER
2911-15045-0023 WHEN THE SHORE SWARMED WITH SAVAGES WHO HAD COME TO THE YEARLY TRADE FROM THE GREAT COMMUNITIES OF THE INTERIOR
2911-15045-0025 TO THE NORTH OF THE RIVER THERE WAS INDEED A SMALL ALGONQUIN BAND CALLED LA PETITE NATION TOGETHER WITH ONE OR TWO OTHER FEEBLE COMMUNITIES BUT THEY DWELT FAR FROM THE BANKS THROUGH FEAR OF THE UBIQUITOUS IROQUOIS
2911-15045-0026 IT WAS NEARLY THREE HUNDRED MILES BY THE WINDINGS OF THE STREAM BEFORE ONE REACHED THAT ALGONQUIN TRIBE
2911-15045-0028 HE REACHED FOR THE FIRST TIME A PEOPLE SPEAKING A DIALECT OF THE IROQUOIS TONGUE HERE ALL WAS CHANGED POPULOUS TOWNS RUDE FORTIFICATIONS AND AN EXTENSIVE THOUGH BARBAROUS TILLAGE
2911-15045-0029 INDICATED A PEOPLE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE FAMISHED WANDERERS OF THE SAGUENAY OR THEIR LESS ABJECT KINDRED OF NEW ENGLAND
2911-15084-0001 FROM WHOSE CONVERSION IT WAS VAIN TO LOOK FOR THE SAME SOLID AND DECISIVE RESULTS IN A MEASURE THE OCCUPATION OF THE JESUITS WAS GONE SOME OF THEM WENT HOME WELL RESOLVED WRITES THE FATHER SUPERIOR
2911-15084-0002 ABOUT TWENTY IN NUMBER SEVERAL SOON FELL VICTIMS TO FAMINE
2911-15084-0004 SAVAGES TAMED NOT CIVILIZED FOR THAT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE WOULD HAVE BEEN DISTRIBUTED IN COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE VALLEYS OF THE GREAT LAKES AND THE MISSISSIPPI RULED BY PRIESTS IN THE INTEREST OF CATHOLICITY AND OF FRANCE
2911-15084-0005 UNMOLESTED BY INDIAN ENEMIES AND FED BY A RICH COMMERCE SHE WOULD HAVE PUT FORTH A VIGOROUS GROWTH TRUE TO HER FAR REACHING AND ADVENTUROUS GENIUS SHE WOULD HAVE OCCUPIED THE WEST WITH TRADERS SETTLERS AND GARRISONS
2911-15084-0007 NOT BY A DEPLETED ANTAGONIST STILL FEEBLE FROM THE EXHAUSTION OF A STARVED AND PERSECUTED INFANCY BUT BY AN ATHLETIC CHAMPION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RICHELIEU AND OF LOYOLA LIBERTY MAY THANK THE IROQUOIS THAT BY THEIR INSENSATE FURY
2911-15084-0008 AND A PERIL AND A WOE AVERTED FROM HER FUTURE THEY RUINED THE TRADE WHICH WAS THE LIFE BLOOD OF NEW FRANCE THEY STOPPED THE CURRENT OF HER ARTERIES AND MADE ALL HER EARLY YEARS A MISERY AND A TERROR NOT THAT THEY CHANGED HER DESTINIES
2911-15084-0010 POPULATIONS FORMED IN THE IDEAS AND HABITS OF A FEUDAL MONARCHY AND CONTROLLED BY A HIERARCHY PROFOUNDLY HOSTILE TO FREEDOM OF THOUGHT WOULD HAVE REMAINED A HINDRANCE AND A STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF THAT MAJESTIC EXPERIMENT
2911-15084-0011 OF WHICH AMERICA IS THE FIELD THE JESUITS SAW THEIR HOPES STRUCK DOWN AND THEIR FAITH THOUGH NOT SHAKEN WAS SORELY TRIED THE PROVIDENCE OF GOD SEEMED IN THEIR EYES DARK AND INEXPLICABLE BUT FROM THE STAND POINT OF LIBERTY
2911-15084-0013 BUT NOW NEW SCENES SUCCEED AND OTHER ACTORS ENTER ON THE STAGE A HARDY AND VALIANT BAND MOULDED TO ENDURE AND DARE
2952-407-0000 EVEN TO DAY IN THE COURTS OF CERTAIN JAPANESE TEMPLES YOU MAY SEE HEAPS OF OLD BRONZE MIRRORS CONTRIBUTED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE THE LARGEST COLLECTION OF THIS KIND THAT I EVER SAW WAS IN THE COURT OF A TEMPLE OF THE JODO SECT AT HAKATA IN KYUSHU
2952-407-0002 BUT SHE HAD NOT THE MONEY NECESSARY WHENEVER SHE WENT TO THE TEMPLE SHE SAW HER MIRROR LYING IN THE COURT YARD BEHIND A RAILING AMONG HUNDREDS OF OTHER MIRRORS HEAPED THERE TOGETHER SHE KNEW IT BY THE SHO CHIKU BAI IN RELIEF ON THE BACK OF IT THOSE THREE FORTUNATE EMBLEMS OF PINE BAMBOO AND PLUMFLOWER
2952-407-0003 WHICH DELIGHTED HER BABY EYES WHEN HER MOTHER FIRST SHOWED HER THE MIRROR SHE LONGED FOR SOME CHANCE TO STEAL THE MIRROR AND HIDE IT THAT SHE MIGHT THEREAFTER TREASURE IT ALWAYS BUT THE CHANCE DID NOT COME AND SHE BECAME VERY UNHAPPY FELT AS IF SHE HAD FOOLISHLY GIVEN AWAY A PART OF HER LIFE
2952-407-0005 EVIDENTLY THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN THAT MIRROR TO THE TEMPLE MUST HAVE REGRETTED THE GIVING SHE HAD NOT PRESENTED HER OFFERING WITH ALL HER HEART AND THEREFORE HER SELFISH SOUL REMAINING ATTACHED TO THE MIRROR KEPT IT HARD AND COLD IN THE MIDST OF THE FURNACE
2952-407-0006 OF COURSE EVERYBODY HEARD OF THE MATTER AND EVERYBODY SOON KNEW WHOSE MIRROR IT WAS THAT WOULD NOT MELT AND BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC EXPOSURE OF HER SECRET FAULT THE POOR WOMAN BECAME VERY MUCH ASHAMED AND VERY ANGRY AND AS SHE COULD NOT BEAR THE SHAME SHE DROWNED HERSELF
2952-407-0008 BUT THE BELL PROVED TO BE A GOOD BELL AND IT BRAVELY WITHSTOOD THEIR ASSAULTS NEVERTHELESS THE PEOPLE WERE NOT EASILY DISCOURAGED DAY AFTER DAY AT ALL HOURS THEY CONTINUED TO RING THE BELL FURIOUSLY CARING NOTHING WHATEVER FOR THE PROTESTS OF THE PRIESTS
2952-407-0009 SO THE RINGING BECAME AN AFFLICTION AND THE PRIESTS COULD NOT ENDURE IT AND THEY GOT RID OF THE BELL BY ROLLING IT DOWN THE HILL INTO A SWAMP THE SWAMP WAS DEEP AND SWALLOWED IT UP AND THAT WAS THE END OF THE BELL
2952-407-0011 THE WORD ITSELF CANNOT BE ADEQUATELY RENDERED BY ANY ENGLISH WORD FOR IT IS USED IN RELATION TO MANY KINDS OF MIMETIC MAGIC AS WELL AS IN RELATION TO THE PERFORMANCE OF MANY RELIGIOUS ACTS OF FAITH
2952-407-0012 TO COMPARE TO LIKEN BUT THE ESOTERIC MEANING IS TO SUBSTITUTE IN IMAGINATION ONE OBJECT OR ACTION FOR ANOTHER SO AS TO BRING ABOUT SOME MAGICAL OR MIRACULOUS RESULT
2952-407-0014 YOU CANNOT READ THE SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE VOLUMES OF THE BUDDHIST TEXTS BUT YOU CAN MAKE A REVOLVING LIBRARY CONTAINING THEM TURN ROUND BY PUSHING IT LIKE A WINDLASS
2952-407-0015 SO MUCH WILL PERHAPS SUFFICE TO EXPLAIN THE RELIGIOUS MEANINGS OF NAZORAERU THE MAGICAL MEANINGS COULD NOT ALL BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT A GREAT VARIETY OF EXAMPLES BUT FOR PRESENT PURPOSES THE FOLLOWING WILL SERVE IF YOU SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE MAN OF STRAW
2952-407-0017 THAT WOULD ILLUSTRATE ONE SIGNIFICATION OF NAZORAERU OR LET US SUPPOSE THAT A ROBBER HAS ENTERED YOUR HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT AND CARRIED AWAY YOUR VALUABLES IF YOU CAN DISCOVER THE FOOTPRINTS OF THAT ROBBER IN YOUR GARDEN AND THEN PROMPTLY BURN A VERY LARGE MOXA ON EACH OF THEM
2952-407-0018 THE SOLES OF THE FEET OF THE ROBBER WILL BECOME INFLAMED AND WILL ALLOW HIM NO REST UNTIL HE RETURNS OF HIS OWN ACCORD TO PUT HIMSELF AT YOUR MERCY THAT IS ANOTHER KIND OF MIMETIC MAGIC EXPRESSED BY THE TERM NAZORAERU
2952-407-0020 BUT PERSONS WHO REGRETTED THIS LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY WOULD STRIKE AND BREAK OBJECTS IMAGINATIVELY SUBSTITUTED FOR THE BELL THUS HOPING TO PLEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE OWNER OF THE MIRROR THAT HAD MADE SO MUCH TROUBLE ONE OF THESE PERSONS WAS A WOMAN CALLED UMEGAE
2952-407-0021 WHILE THE PAIR WERE TRAVELING TOGETHER KAJIWARA ONE DAY FOUND HIMSELF IN GREAT STRAITS FOR WANT OF MONEY AND UMEGAE REMEMBERING THE TRADITION OF THE BELL OF MUGEN TOOK A BASIN OF BRONZE AND MENTALLY REPRESENTING IT TO BE THE BELL BEAT UPON IT UNTIL SHE BROKE IT
2952-407-0023 AFTERWARDS A SONG WAS MADE ABOUT UMEGAE'S BASIN OF BRONZE AND THAT SONG IS SUNG BY DANCING GIRLS EVEN TO THIS DAY UMEGAE NO CHOZUBACHI TATAITE
2952-407-0024 IF BY STRIKING UPON THE WASH BASIN OF UMEGAE I COULD MAKE HONORABLE MONEY COME TO ME
2952-407-0026 AS IT DESERVES TO BE ANSWERED TAKE THEREFORE THIS JAR SO SAYING SHE PUT THE JAR INTO HIS HANDS AND DISAPPEARED INTO HIS HOUSE THE HAPPY MAN RUSHED TO TELL HIS WIFE THE GOOD NEWS HE SET DOWN IN FRONT OF HER THE COVERED JAR WHICH WAS HEAVY
2952-407-0027 AND THEY OPENED IT TOGETHER AND THEY FOUND THAT IT WAS FILLED UP TO THE VERY BRIM WITH
2952-408-0001 FOR A LONG TIME HE WANDERED ABOUT HELPLESSLY AND HE WAS BEGINNING TO DESPAIR OF FINDING SHELTER FOR THE NIGHT WHEN HE PERCEIVED ON THE TOP OF A HILL LIGHTED BY THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN ONE OF THOSE LITTLE HERMITAGES CALLED
2952-408-0002 WHICH ARE BUILT FOR SOLITARY PRIESTS IT SEEMED TO BE IN RUINOUS CONDITION BUT HE HASTENED TO IT EAGERLY AND FOUND THAT IT WAS INHABITED BY AN AGED PRIEST FROM WHOM HE BEGGED THE FAVOR OF A NIGHT'S LODGING
2952-408-0004 BUT A LITTLE BEFORE MIDNIGHT HE WAS ROUSED FROM SLEEP BY A SOUND OF LOUD WEEPING IN THE NEXT APARTMENT PRESENTLY THE SLIDING SCREENS WERE GENTLY PUSHED APART AND A YOUNG MAN CARRYING A LIGHTED LANTERN ENTERED THE ROOM RESPECTFULLY SALUTED HIM AND SAID
2952-408-0005 THE PEOPLE WHOM YOU SAW IN THE NEXT ROOM ARE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS VILLAGE
2952-408-0007 BUT I AM SORRY THAT YOU DID NOT TELL ME OF YOUR FATHER'S DEATH WHEN I CAME FOR THOUGH I WAS A LITTLE TIRED I CERTAINLY WAS NOT SO TIRED THAT I SHOULD HAVE FOUND DIFFICULTY IN DOING MY DUTY AS A PRIEST HAD YOU TOLD ME I COULD HAVE PERFORMED THE SERVICE BEFORE YOUR DEPARTURE
2952-408-0008 AS IT IS I SHALL PERFORM THE SERVICE AFTER YOU HAVE GONE AWAY AND I SHALL STAY BY THE BODY UNTIL MORNING I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY YOUR WORDS ABOUT THE DANGER OF STAYING HERE ALONE
2952-408-0010 BY THE RULE OF OUR VILLAGE NONE OF US CAN STAY HERE AFTER MIDNIGHT WE BEG KIND SIR THAT YOU WILL TAKE EVERY CARE OF YOUR HONORABLE BODY WHILE WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTEND UPON YOU AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO HEAR OR SEE ANYTHING STRANGE DURING OUR ABSENCE PLEASE TELL US OF THE MATTER WHEN WE RETURN IN THE MORNING
2952-408-0011 ALL THEN LEFT THE HOUSE EXCEPT THE PRIEST WHO WENT TO THE ROOM WHERE THE DEAD BODY WAS LYING THE USUAL OFFERINGS HAD BEEN SET BEFORE THE CORPSE AND A SMALL BUDDHIST LAMP TOMYO WAS BURNING
2952-408-0013 BUT WHEN THE HUSH OF THE NIGHT WAS AT ITS DEEPEST THERE NOISELESSLY ENTERED A SHAPE VAGUE AND VAST AND IN THE SAME MOMENT MUSO FOUND HIMSELF WITHOUT POWER TO MOVE OR SPEAK
2952-408-0014 HE SAW THAT SHAPE LIFT THE CORPSE AS WITH HANDS DEVOUR IT MORE QUICKLY THAN A CAT DEVOURS A RAT BEGINNING AT THE HEAD AND EATING EVERYTHING THE HAIR AND THE BONES AND EVEN THE SHROUD AND THE MONSTROUS THING HAVING THUS CONSUMED THE BODY
2952-408-0016 AND LOOKED ABOUT THE ROOM NO ONE EXPRESSED ANY SURPRISE AT THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE DEAD BODY AND THE OFFERINGS BUT THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID TO MUSO REVERENT SIR YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN UNPLEASANT THINGS DURING THE NIGHT
2952-408-0017 ALL OF US WERE ANXIOUS ABOUT YOU BUT NOW WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO FIND YOU ALIVE AND UNHARMED GLADLY WE WOULD HAVE STAYED WITH YOU IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE BUT THE LAW OF OUR VILLAGE AS I TOLD YOU LAST EVENING OBLIGES US TO QUIT OUR HOUSES AFTER A DEATH HAS TAKEN PLACE
2952-408-0019 THEN MUSO TOLD OF THE DIM AND AWFUL SHAPE THAT HAD ENTERED THE DEATH CHAMBER TO DEVOUR THE BODY AND THE OFFERINGS NO PERSON SEEMED TO BE SURPRISED BY HIS NARRATION AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE OBSERVED
2952-408-0020 WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD US REVEREND SIR AGREES WITH WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THIS MATTER FROM ANCIENT TIME MUSO THEN INQUIRED DOES NOT THE PRIEST ON THE HILL SOMETIMES PERFORM THE FUNERAL SERVICE FOR YOUR DEAD WHAT PRIEST THE YOUNG MAN ASKED
2952-408-0022 AND AFTER A MOMENT OF SILENCE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE SAID REVEREND SIR THERE IS NO PRIEST AND THERE IS NO ANJITSU ON THE HILL FOR THE TIME OF MANY GENERATIONS THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY RESIDENT PRIEST IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MUSO SAID NOTHING MORE ON THE SUBJECT
2952-408-0023 FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HIS KIND HOSTS SUPPOSED HIM TO HAVE BEEN DELUDED BY SOME GOBLIN BUT AFTER HAVING BIDDEN THEM FAREWELL AND OBTAINED ALL NECESSARY INFORMATION AS TO HIS ROAD HE DETERMINED TO LOOK AGAIN FOR THE HERMITAGE ON THE HILL AND SO TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER HE HAD REALLY BEEN DECEIVED
2952-408-0025 YOU NEED NOT BE ASHAMED FOR HAVING REFUSED ME SHELTER SAID MUSO YOU DIRECTED ME TO THE VILLAGE YONDER WHERE I WAS VERY KINDLY TREATED AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT FAVOR I CAN GIVE NO MAN SHELTER THE RECLUSE MADE ANSWER
2952-408-0026 SO IN THAT TIME THE BODIES OF THE MOUNTAIN FOLK WHO DIED USED TO BE BROUGHT HERE SOMETIMES FROM GREAT DISTANCES IN ORDER THAT I MIGHT REPEAT OVER THEM THE HOLY SERVICE BUT I REPEATED THE SERVICE AND PERFORMED THE RITES ONLY AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS
2952-408-0028 SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO FEED UPON THE CORPSES OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIE IN THIS DISTRICT EVERY ONE OF THEM I MUST DEVOUR IN THE WAY THAT YOU SAW LAST NIGHT NOW REVEREND SIR
2952-408-0029 HELP ME BY YOUR PRAYERS I ENTREAT YOU SO THAT I MAY BE SOON ABLE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS HORRIBLE STATE OF EXISTENCE NO SOONER HAD THE HERMIT UTTERED THIS PETITION THAN HE DISAPPEARED AND THE HERMITAGE ALSO DISAPPEARED AT THE SAME INSTANT
2952-410-0001 BUT AS HE HAD NEVER SOUGHT DISTINCTION FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALONE AND AS HIS HEART REMAINED TRUE TO HIS FORMER LORD HE PREFERRED TO GIVE UP THE WORLD SO HE CUT OFF HIS HAIR AND BECAME A TRAVELING PRIEST TAKING THE BUDDHIST NAME OF KWAIRYO
2952-410-0002 AS IN OTHER YEARS HE HAD LAUGHED AT PERIL SO NOW ALSO HE SCORNED DANGER
2952-410-0004 HE HAD ALWAYS WELCOMED DISCOMFORT AND EVEN A BARE ROCK WAS FOR HIM A GOOD BED WHEN NOTHING BETTER COULD BE FOUND AND THE ROOT OF A PINE TREE AN EXCELLENT PILLOW HIS BODY WAS IRON AND HE NEVER TROUBLED HIMSELF ABOUT DEWS OR RAIN OR FROST OR SNOW
2952-410-0005 SCARCELY HAD HE LAIN DOWN WHEN A MAN CAME ALONG THE ROAD CARRYING AN AXE AND A GREAT BUNDLE OF CHOPPED WOOD THIS WOODCUTTER HALTED ON SEEING KWAIRYO LYING DOWN
2952-410-0007 MY FRIEND CHEERFULLY ANSWERED KWAIRYO I AM ONLY A WANDERING PRIEST A CLOUD AND WATER GUEST AS FOLKS CALL IT
2952-410-0008 AS FOR LONESOME PLACES I LIKE THEM THEY ARE SUITABLE FOR MEDITATION I AM ACCUSTOMED TO SLEEPING IN THE OPEN AIR AND I HAVE LEARNED NEVER TO BE ANXIOUS ABOUT MY LIFE
2952-410-0010 AND I MUST ASSURE YOU SIR THAT IT IS VERY DANGEROUS TO SLEEP HERE THEREFORE ALTHOUGH MY HOUSE IS ONLY A WRETCHED THATCHED HUT LET ME BEG OF YOU TO COME HOME WITH ME AT ONCE IN THE WAY OF FOOD I HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER YOU BUT THERE IS A ROOF AT LEAST AND YOU CAN SLEEP UNDER IT WITHOUT RISK
2952-410-0011 ACCEPTED THIS MODEST OFFER THE WOODCUTTER GUIDED HIM ALONG A NARROW PATH LEADING UP FROM THE MAIN ROAD THROUGH MOUNTAIN FOREST IT WAS A ROUGH AND DANGEROUS PATH SOMETIMES SKIRTING PRECIPICES SOMETIMES OFFERING NOTHING BUT A NETWORK OF
2952-410-0013 AND THEY MUST HAVE BEEN TAUGHT BY SOME ONE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE RULES OF PROPRIETY THEN TURNING TO HIS HOST THE ARUJI OR HOUSE MASTER AS THE OTHERS CALLED HIM KWAIRYO SAID
2952-410-0014 FROM THE KINDNESS OF YOUR SPEECH AND FROM THE VERY POLITE WELCOME GIVEN ME BY YOUR HOUSEHOLD I IMAGINE THAT YOU HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN A WOODCUTTER PERHAPS YOU FORMERLY BELONGED TO ONE OF THE UPPER CLASSES SMILING THE WOODCUTTER ANSWERED SIR YOU ARE NOT MISTAKEN
2952-410-0016 BUT I LOVED WOMEN AND WINE TOO WELL AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PASSION I ACTED WICKEDLY
2952-410-0017 RETRIBUTION FOLLOWED ME AND I LONG REMAINED A FUGITIVE IN THE LAND NOW I OFTEN PRAY THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME ATONEMENT FOR THE EVIL WHICH I DID AND TO REESTABLISH THE ANCESTRAL HOME BUT I FEAR THAT I SHALL NEVER FIND ANY WAY OF SO DOING
2952-410-0019 IN THE HOLY SUTRAS IT IS WRITTEN THAT THOSE STRONGEST IN WRONG DOING CAN BECOME BY POWER OF GOOD RESOLVE THE STRONGEST IN RIGHT DOING I DO NOT DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART AND I HOPE THAT BETTER FORTUNE WILL COME TO YOU
2952-410-0020 TO NIGHT I SHALL RECITE THE SUTRAS FOR YOUR SAKE AND PRAY THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN THE FORCE TO OVERCOME THE KARMA OF ANY PAST ERRORS WITH THESE ASSURANCES KWAIRYO BADE THE ARUJI GOOD NIGHT AND HIS HOST SHOWED HIM TO A VERY SMALL SIDE ROOM WHERE A BED HAD BEEN MADE READY
2952-410-0022 THE NIGHT WAS BEAUTIFUL THERE WAS NO CLOUD IN THE SKY THERE WAS NO WIND AND THE STRONG MOONLIGHT THREW DOWN SHARP BLACK SHADOWS OF FOLIAGE AND GLITTERED ON THE DEWS OF THE GARDEN
2952-410-0023 AND THE SOUND OF THE NEIGHBORING CASCADE DEEPENED WITH THE NIGHT KWAIRYO FELT THIRSTY AS HE LISTENED TO THE NOISE OF THE WATER AND REMEMBERING THE BAMBOO AQUEDUCT AT THE REAR OF THE HOUSE HE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD GO THERE AND GET A DRINK WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SLEEPING HOUSEHOLD
2952-410-0025 FOR ONE INSTANT HE STOOD BEWILDERED IMAGINING A CRIME BUT IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE PERCEIVED THAT THERE WAS NO BLOOD AND THAT THE HEADLESS NECKS DID NOT LOOK AS IF THEY HAD BEEN CUT THEN HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0026 AND REMOVE THE BODY TO ANOTHER PLACE THE HEAD WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO JOIN ITSELF AGAIN TO THE NECK AND THE BOOK FURTHER SAYS THAT WHEN THE HEAD COMES BACK AND FINDS THAT ITS BODY HAS BEEN MOVED IT WILL STRIKE ITSELF UPON THE FLOOR THREE TIMES BOUNDING LIKE A BALL AND WILL PANT AS IN GREAT FEAR
2952-410-0028 GENTLY UNBARRING THE DOOR HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE GARDEN AND PROCEEDED WITH ALL POSSIBLE CAUTION TO THE GROVE BEYOND IT HE HEARD VOICES TALKING IN THE GROVE AND HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE VOICES STEALING FROM SHADOW TO SHADOW UNTIL HE REACHED A GOOD HIDING PLACE
2952-410-0029 THEN FROM BEHIND A TRUNK HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE HEADS ALL FIVE OF THEM FLITTING ABOUT AND CHATTING AS THEY FLITTED THEY WERE EATING WORMS AND INSECTS WHICH THEY FOUND ON THE GROUND OR AMONG THE TREES
2952-410-0031 TO GO NEAR HIM WHILE HE IS RECITING WOULD BE DIFFICULT AND WE CANNOT TOUCH HIM SO LONG AS HE IS PRAYING BUT AS IT IS NOW NEARLY MORNING PERHAPS HE HAS GONE TO SLEEP SOME ONE OF YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND SEE WHAT THE FELLOW IS DOING
2952-410-0032 ANOTHER HEAD THE HEAD OF A YOUNG WOMAN IMMEDIATELY ROSE UP AND FLITTED TO THE HOUSE LIGHTLY AS A BAT AFTER A FEW MINUTES IT CAME BACK AND CRIED OUT HUSKILY IN A TONE OF GREAT ALARM THAT TRAVELING PRIEST IS NOT IN THE HOUSE HE IS GONE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WORST OF THE MATTER
2952-410-0034 SINCE MY BODY HAS BEEN MOVED TO REJOIN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE THEN I MUST DIE AND ALL THROUGH THE WORK OF THAT PRIEST
2952-410-0035 AND THERE HE IS BEHIND THAT TREE HIDING BEHIND THAT TREE SEE HIM THE FAT COWARD IN THE SAME MOMENT THE HEAD OF THE ARUJI FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER FOUR HEADS SPRANG AT KWAIRYO
2952-410-0037 AND AT LAST CAUGHT HIM BY THE LEFT SLEEVE OF HIS ROBE KWAIRYO HOWEVER AS QUICKLY GRIPPED THE HEAD BY ITS TOPKNOT AND REPEATEDLY STRUCK IT IT DID NOT RELEASE ITS HOLD BUT IT UTTERED A LONG MOAN AND THEREAFTER CEASED TO STRUGGLE IT WAS DEAD
2952-410-0038 BUT ITS TEETH STILL HELD THE SLEEVE AND FOR ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH KWAIRYO COULD NOT FORCE OPEN THE JAWS WITH THE HEAD STILL HANGING TO HIS SLEEVE HE WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE AND THERE CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE OTHER FOUR ROKURO KUBI SQUATTING TOGETHER
2952-410-0040 AND KWAIRYO KNEW THAT THE POWER OF THE GOBLINS WAS LIMITED TO THE HOURS OF DARKNESS HE LOOKED AT THE HEAD CLINGING TO HIS SLEEVE ITS FACE ALL FOULED WITH BLOOD AND FOAM AND CLAY AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD AS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
2952-410-0041 AFTER WHICH HE GATHERED TOGETHER HIS FEW BELONGINGS AND LEISURELY DESCENDED THE MOUNTAIN TO CONTINUE HIS JOURNEY RIGHT ON HE JOURNEYED UNTIL HE CAME TO SUWA
2952-410-0043 SO AFTER HAVING PASSED A NIGHT IN PRISON HE WAS BROUGHT BEFORE THE MAGISTRATES OF THE DISTRICT THEN HE WAS ORDERED TO EXPLAIN HOW HE A PRIEST HAD BEEN FOUND WITH THE HEAD OF A MAN FASTENED TO HIS SLEEVE AND WHY HE HAD DARED THUS SHAMELESSLY TO PARADE HIS CRIME IN THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE
2952-410-0044 KWAIRYO LAUGHED LONG AND LOUDLY AT THESE QUESTIONS AND THEN HE SAID SIRS I DID NOT FASTEN THE HEAD TO MY SLEEVE IT FASTENED ITSELF THERE MUCH AGAINST MY WILL AND I HAVE NOT COMMITTED ANY CRIME FOR THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS THE HEAD OF A GOBLIN
2952-410-0046 A VERY OLD MAN THIS AGED OFFICER HAD MADE NO REMARK DURING THE TRIAL BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD THE OPINION OF HIS COLLEAGUES HE ROSE UP AND SAID LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE HEAD CAREFULLY FOR THIS I THINK HAS NOT YET BEEN DONE
2952-410-0047 THE OLD MAN TURNED IT ROUND AND ROUND CAREFULLY EXAMINED IT AND DISCOVERED ON THE NAPE OF ITS NECK SEVERAL STRANGE RED CHARACTERS HE CALLED THE ATTENTION OF HIS COLLEAGUES TO THESE AND ALSO BADE THEM OBSERVE THAT THE EDGES OF THE NECK NOWHERE PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING BEEN CUT BY ANY WEAPON
2952-410-0049 THERE ARE THE CHARACTERS YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELVES THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAINTED MOREOVER IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SUCH GOBLINS HAVE BEEN DWELLING IN THE MOUNTAINS OF THE PROVINCE OF KAI FROM VERY ANCIENT TIME BUT YOU SIR HE EXCLAIMED TURNING TO KWAIRYO
2952-410-0050 PERHAPS YOU ONCE BELONGED TO THE SAMURAI CLASS
2952-410-0052 AT THE MENTION OF THAT NAME A MURMUR OF ADMIRATION FILLED THE COURT ROOM FOR THERE WERE MANY PRESENT WHO REMEMBERED IT AND KWAIRYO IMMEDIATELY FOUND HIMSELF AMONG FRIENDS INSTEAD OF JUDGES FRIENDS ANXIOUS TO PROVE THEIR ADMIRATION BY FRATERNAL KINDNESS
2952-410-0053 WHEN KWAIRYO LEFT SUWA HE WAS AS HAPPY AS ANY PRIEST IS PERMITTED TO BE IN THIS TRANSITORY WORLD AS FOR THE HEAD HE TOOK IT WITH HIM JOCOSELY INSISTING THAT HE INTENDED IT FOR A MIYAGE AND NOW IT ONLY REMAINS TO TELL WHAT BECAME OF THE HEAD
2952-410-0055 THOUGH BRAVE THE HIGHWAYMAN WAS STARTLED HE DROPPED THE GARMENT AND SPRANG BACK THEN HE CRIED OUT YOU
2952-410-0056 KWAIRYO ANSWERED I SHALL LET YOU HAVE THE HEAD AND THE ROBE IF YOU INSIST BUT I MUST TELL YOU THAT THIS IS NOT THE HEAD OF A MAN IT IS A GOBLIN'S HEAD SO IF YOU BUY IT AND HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN CONSEQUENCE PLEASE TO REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE NOT DECEIVED BY ME
2952-410-0058 TAKE THE THING SAID KWAIRYO I WAS NOT JOKING
2952-410-0059 AND HE THEN BECAME AFRAID THAT THE SPIRIT OF THE ROKURO KUBI MIGHT GIVE HIM TROUBLE SO HE MADE UP HIS MIND TO TAKE BACK THE HEAD TO THE PLACE FROM WHICH IT HAD COME AND TO BURY IT WITH ITS BODY HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE LONELY COTTAGE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF KAI BUT NOBODY WAS THERE
2989-138028-0000 CHAPTER SIX OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
2989-138028-0001 BUT IT WAS ALL PREACHING IN THE DESERT AND HAMMERING COLD IRON NEVERTHELESS AMONG MANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS MADE TO HIM THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TO HIM IN TRUTH MASTER IF YOU DO NOT KEEP STILL AND STAY QUIET AT HOME
2989-138028-0003 AND THEREFORE I SHOULD BE SORRY THAT ANY AFFAIRS OF MINE SHOULD WORRY HIM WHEREUPON THE HOUSEKEEPER SAID TELL US SENOR AT HIS MAJESTY'S COURT ARE THERE NO KNIGHTS THERE ARE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE AND PLENTY OF THEM AND IT IS RIGHT THERE SHOULD BE
2989-138028-0004 TO SET OFF THE DIGNITY OF THE PRINCE AND FOR THE GREATER GLORY OF THE KING'S MAJESTY THEN MIGHT NOT YOUR WORSHIP SAID SHE BE ONE OF THOSE THAT WITHOUT STIRRING A STEP SERVE THEIR KING AND LORD IN HIS COURT
2989-138028-0006 THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND ANOTHER FOR THE COURTIERS WITHOUT QUITTING THEIR CHAMBERS OR THE THRESHOLD OF THE COURT RANGE THE WORLD OVER BY LOOKING AT A MAP WITHOUT ITS COSTING THEM A FARTHING AND WITHOUT SUFFERING HEAT OR COLD HUNGER OR THIRST
2989-138028-0007 BUT WE THE TRUE KNIGHTS ERRANT MEASURE THE WHOLE EARTH WITH OUR OWN FEET EXPOSED TO THE SUN TO THE COLD TO THE AIR TO THE INCLEMENCIES OF HEAVEN BY DAY AND NIGHT ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK
2989-138028-0009 WHETHER ONE CARRIES RELICS OR ANY SECRET CONTRIVANCE ABOUT HIM WHETHER OR NOT THE SUN IS TO BE DIVIDED AND PORTIONED OUT AND OTHER NICETIES OF THE SORT THAT ARE OBSERVED IN SET COMBATS OF MAN TO MAN THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT BUT I DO
2989-138028-0010 AND YOU MUST KNOW BESIDES THAT THE TRUE KNIGHT ERRANT THOUGH HE MAY SEE TEN GIANTS THAT NOT ONLY TOUCH THE CLOUDS WITH THEIR HEADS BUT PIERCE THEM AND THAT GO EACH OF THEM ON TWO TALL TOWERS BY WAY OF LEGS AND WHOSE ARMS ARE LIKE THE MASTS OF MIGHTY SHIPS AND EACH EYE LIKE A GREAT MILL WHEEL
2989-138028-0012 WIELD TRENCHANT BLADES OF DAMASCUS STEEL OR CLUBS STUDDED WITH SPIKES ALSO OF STEEL SUCH AS I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE SEEN
2989-138028-0013 AND IT WOULD BE WELL IF THERE WERE NO PRINCE WHO DID NOT SET A HIGHER VALUE ON THIS SECOND OR MORE PROPERLY SPEAKING FIRST KIND OF KNIGHTS ERRANT FOR AS WE READ IN THEIR HISTORIES
2989-138028-0015 FOR HE WAS THE MOST HUMBLE MINDED AND COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF HIS TIME
2989-138028-0016 BUT SOME THERE ARE THAT MIGHT HAVE HEARD THEE AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WELL FOR THEE IN THAT CASE FOR THEY ARE NOT ALL COURTEOUS OR MANNERLY SOME ARE ILL CONDITIONED SCOUNDRELS NOR IS IT EVERYONE THAT CALLS HIMSELF A GENTLEMAN THAT IS SO IN ALL RESPECTS SOME ARE GOLD OTHERS PINCHBECK
2989-138028-0018 GOD BLESS ME SAID THE NIECE THAT YOU SHOULD KNOW SO MUCH UNCLE
2989-138028-0019 AND YET THAT YOU SHOULD FALL INTO A DELUSION SO GREAT AND A FOLLY SO MANIFEST AS TO TRY TO MAKE YOURSELF OUT VIGOROUS WHEN YOU ARE OLD STRONG WHEN YOU ARE SICKLY ABLE TO PUT STRAIGHT WHAT IS CROOKED WHEN YOU YOURSELF ARE BENT BY AGE AND ABOVE ALL A CABALLERO WHEN YOU ARE NOT ONE
2989-138028-0021 AND STILL MAINTAIN AND UPHOLD THE GREATNESS OF THEIR ORIGIN THOSE AGAIN THAT FROM A GREAT BEGINNING HAVE ENDED IN A POINT LIKE A PYRAMID HAVING REDUCED AND LESSENED THEIR ORIGINAL GREATNESS
2989-138028-0022 THOSE THAT HAD AN HUMBLE ORIGIN AND ROSE TO THE GREATNESS THEY STILL PRESERVE
2989-138028-0024 OF COUNTLESS PRINCES MONARCHS LORDS MEDES ASSYRIANS PERSIANS GREEKS AND BARBARIANS ALL THESE LINEAGES AND LORDSHIPS HAVE ENDED IN A POINT AND COME TO NOTHING
2989-138028-0025 FOR IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE NOW TO FIND ONE OF THEIR DESCENDANTS AND EVEN SHOULD WE FIND ONE IT WOULD BE IN SOME LOWLY AND HUMBLE CONDITION OF PLEBEIAN LINEAGES I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY SAVE THAT THEY MERELY SERVE TO SWELL THE NUMBER OF THOSE THAT LIVE
2989-138028-0027 BUT ABOVE ALL BY BEING CHARITABLE FOR BY TWO MARAVEDIS GIVEN WITH A CHEERFUL HEART TO THE POOR HE WILL SHOW HIMSELF AS GENEROUS AS HE WHO DISTRIBUTES ALMS WITH BELL RINGING AND NO ONE THAT PERCEIVES HIM TO BE ENDOWED WITH THE VIRTUES I HAVE NAMED
2989-138028-0028 EVEN THOUGH HE KNOW HIM NOT WILL FAIL TO RECOGNISE AND SET HIM DOWN AS ONE OF GOOD BLOOD AND IT WOULD BE STRANGE WERE IT NOT SO PRAISE HAS EVER BEEN THE REWARD OF VIRTUE AND THOSE WHO ARE VIRTUOUS CANNOT FAIL TO RECEIVE COMMENDATION
2989-138028-0030 I AM THEREFORE IN A MEASURE CONSTRAINED TO FOLLOW THAT ROAD
2989-138028-0031 AND IT WILL BE LABOUR IN VAIN FOR YOU TO URGE ME TO RESIST WHAT HEAVEN WILLS FATE ORDAINS REASON REQUIRES AND ABOVE ALL MY OWN INCLINATION FAVOURS FOR KNOWING AS I DO THE COUNTLESS TOILS THAT ARE THE ACCOMPANIMENTS OF KNIGHT ERRANTRY
2989-138028-0033 I KNOW AS OUR GREAT CASTILIAN POET SAYS THAT IT IS BY RUGGED PATHS LIKE THESE THEY GO THAT SCALE THE HEIGHTS OF IMMORTALITY UNREACHED BY THOSE THAT FALTER HERE BELOW
2989-138028-0034 I CAN TELL YOU NIECE REPLIED DON QUIXOTE IF THESE CHIVALROUS THOUGHTS DID NOT ENGAGE ALL MY FACULTIES THERE WOULD BE NOTHING THAT I COULD NOT DO NOR ANY SORT OF KNICKKNACK THAT WOULD NOT COME FROM MY HANDS PARTICULARLY CAGES AND TOOTH PICKS
2989-138028-0036 NOTHING SENOR SAMSON SAID SHE ONLY THAT MY MASTER IS BREAKING OUT PLAINLY BREAKING OUT WHEREABOUTS IS HE BREAKING OUT SENORA ASKED SAMSON HAS ANY PART OF HIS BODY BURST HE IS ONLY BREAKING OUT AT THE DOOR OF HIS MADNESS SHE REPLIED
2989-138028-0037 SO THAT TO BRING HIM ROUND AGAIN EVER SO LITTLE COST ME MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED EGGS
2989-138028-0039 SAY THE PRAYER OF SANTA APOLLONIA THAT IS IF YOU KNOW IT FOR I WILL COME PRESENTLY AND YOU WILL SEE MIRACLES WOE IS ME CRIED THE HOUSEKEEPER
2989-138028-0040 THAT WOULD DO IF IT WAS THE TOOTHACHE MY MASTER HAD
2989-138028-0042 REPLIED CARRASCO AND WITH THIS THE HOUSEKEEPER RETIRED
2989-138028-0043 AND ARRANGE WITH HIM WHAT WILL BE TOLD IN ITS PROPER PLACE
2989-138028-0045 FOR I KNOW NOT WHAT I AM SO FOCILE MEANS
2989-138028-0046 AND SUBMIT TO WHAT I TEACH THEE I WOULD BET SAID SANCHO THAT FROM THE VERY FIRST YOU UNDERSTOOD ME AND KNEW WHAT I MEANT BUT YOU WANTED TO PUT ME OUT THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR ME MAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF DOZEN BLUNDERS MAY BE SO REPLIED DON QUIXOTE
2989-138028-0048 AND SO SAY I SAID DON QUIXOTE CONTINUE SANCHO MY FRIEND GO ON YOU TALK PEARLS TO DAY THE FACT IS CONTINUED SANCHO
2989-138028-0049 AND THE LAMB GOES AS SOON AS THE SHEEP AND NOBODY CAN PROMISE HIMSELF MORE HOURS OF LIFE IN THIS WORLD THAN GOD MAY BE PLEASED TO GIVE HIM
2989-138028-0051 AND SO LONG AS ONE GAINS SOMETHING THERE IS NOTHING LOST
2989-138028-0052 AND SO WELL UNDERSTOOD RETURNED DON QUIXOTE THAT I HAVE SEEN INTO THE DEPTHS OF THY THOUGHTS AND KNOW THE MARK THOU ART SHOOTING AT WITH THE COUNTLESS SHAFTS OF THY PROVERBS
2989-138028-0054 BENE QUIDEM IF NOT WE REMAIN FRIENDS FOR IF THE PIGEON HOUSE DOES NOT LACK FOOD IT WILL NOT LACK PIGEONS AND BEAR IN MIND MY SON THAT A GOOD HOPE IS BETTER THAN A BAD HOLDING AND A GOOD GRIEVANCE BETTER THAN A BAD COMPENSATION
2989-138028-0055 AND IN SHORT I MEAN TO SAY AND I DO SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T LIKE TO COME ON REWARD WITH ME AND RUN THE SAME CHANCE THAT I RUN GOD BE WITH YOU
2989-138028-0057 MAY GOD ALMIGHTY IN HIS INFINITE POWER GRANT THAT ANY PERSON OR PERSONS WHO WOULD IMPEDE OR HINDER THY THIRD SALLY MAY FIND NO WAY OUT OF THE LABYRINTH OF THEIR SCHEMES NOR EVER ACCOMPLISH WHAT THEY MOST DESIRE AND THEN TURNING TO THE HOUSEKEEPER HE SAID
2989-138028-0058 FOR I KNOW IT IS THE POSITIVE DETERMINATION OF THE SPHERES THAT SENOR DON QUIXOTE SHALL PROCEED TO PUT INTO EXECUTION HIS NEW AND LOFTY DESIGNS AND I SHOULD LAY A HEAVY BURDEN ON MY CONSCIENCE DID I NOT URGE AND PERSUADE THIS KNIGHT NOT TO KEEP THE MIGHT OF HIS STRONG ARM AND THE VIRTUE OF HIS VALIANT SPIRIT
2989-138028-0060 OF THE HONOUR OF VIRGINS OF THE AID OF WIDOWS AND OF THE SUPPORT OF WIVES AND OTHER MATTERS OF THIS KIND APPERTAINING BELONGING PROPER AND PECULIAR
2989-138028-0061 ON THEN MY LORD DON QUIXOTE BEAUTIFUL AND BRAVE LET YOUR WORSHIP AND HIGHNESS SET OUT TO DAY RATHER THAN TO MORROW AND IF ANYTHING BE NEEDED FOR THE EXECUTION OF YOUR PURPOSE
2989-138028-0063 LET THIS NEW SAMSON REMAIN IN HIS OWN COUNTRY AND BRINGING HONOUR TO IT BRING HONOUR AT THE SAME TIME ON THE GREY HEADS OF HIS VENERABLE PARENTS FOR I WILL BE CONTENT WITH ANY SQUIRE THAT COMES TO HAND AS SANCHO DOES NOT DEIGN TO ACCOMPANY ME
2989-138028-0064 THE BREAD EATEN AND THE COMPANY DISPERSED
2989-138028-0066 NO HAMMER DRIVES THE HOOPS OF A CASK AS SHE DRIVES ONE TO DO WHAT SHE WANTS BUT AFTER ALL A MAN MUST BE A MAN AND A WOMAN A WOMAN AND AS I AM A MAN ANYHOW WHICH I CAN'T DENY I WILL BE ONE IN MY OWN HOUSE TOO LET WHO WILL TAKE IT AMISS
2989-138028-0067 AND SO THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO DO BUT FOR YOUR WORSHIP TO MAKE YOUR WILL WITH ITS CODICIL IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT CAN'T BE PROVOKED
2989-138028-0069 AS HE WAS THERE DESCRIBED BUT NOW HEARING HIM TALK OF A WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE PROVOKED INSTEAD OF WILL AND CODICIL THAT COULD NOT BE REVOKED
2989-138028-0070 IN FINE DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO EMBRACED ONE ANOTHER AND MADE FRIENDS AND BY THE ADVICE AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE GREAT CARRASCO WHO WAS NOW THEIR ORACLE IT WAS ARRANGED THAT THEIR DEPARTURE SHOULD TAKE PLACE THREE DAYS THENCE BY WHICH TIME THEY COULD HAVE
2989-138028-0072 POURED OUT ON THE BACHELOR WERE PAST COUNTING THEY TORE THEIR HAIR THEY CLAWED THEIR FACES AND IN THE STYLE OF THE HIRED MOURNERS THAT WERE ONCE IN FASHION
2989-138028-0073 SAMSON'S INTENTION IN PERSUADING HIM TO SALLY FORTH ONCE MORE WAS TO DO WHAT THE HISTORY RELATES FARTHER ON
2989-138028-0075 HIS ALFORJAS FURNISHED WITH CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE WAY OF VICTUALS AND HIS PURSE WITH MONEY THAT DON QUIXOTE GAVE HIM TO MEET EMERGENCIES SAMSON EMBRACED HIM AND ENTREATED HIM TO LET HIM HEAR OF HIS GOOD OR EVIL FORTUNES SO THAT HE MIGHT REJOICE OVER THE FORMER
2989-138035-0000 IN WHICH IS RELATED THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENAMOURED SHEPHERD TOGETHER WITH OTHER TRULY DROLL INCIDENTS DON QUIXOTE HAD GONE BUT A SHORT DISTANCE BEYOND DON DIEGO'S VILLAGE WHEN HE FELL IN WITH A COUPLE OF EITHER PRIESTS OR STUDENTS AND A COUPLE OF PEASANTS
2989-138035-0002 MADE THEM AN OFFER OF HIS COMPANY AND BEGGED THEM TO SLACKEN THEIR PACE AS THEIR YOUNG ASSES TRAVELLED FASTER THAN HIS HORSE AND THEN TO GRATIFY THEM HE TOLD THEM IN A FEW WORDS WHO HE WAS AND THE CALLING AND PROFESSION HE FOLLOWED
2989-138035-0003 WHICH WAS THAT OF A KNIGHT ERRANT SEEKING ADVENTURES IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD HE INFORMED THEM THAT HIS OWN NAME WAS DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THAT HE WAS CALLED BY WAY OF SURNAME THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS ALL THIS WAS GREEK OR GIBBERISH TO THE PEASANTS
2989-138035-0005 WHO IS CALLED PAR EXCELLENCE
2989-138035-0006 AS THE BRIDEGROOM IS CALLED CAMACHO THE RICH SHE IS EIGHTEEN AND HE TWENTY TWO AND THEY ARE FAIRLY MATCHED THOUGH SOME KNOWING ONES WHO HAVE ALL THE PEDIGREES IN THE WORLD BY HEART WILL HAVE IT THAT THE FAMILY OF THE FAIR QUITERIA IS BETTER THAN CAMACHO'S
2989-138035-0008 HE HAS PROVIDED DANCERS TOO NOT ONLY SWORD BUT ALSO BELL DANCERS FOR IN HIS OWN TOWN THERE ARE THOSE WHO RING THE CHANGES AND JINGLE THE BELLS TO PERFECTION OF SHOE DANCERS I SAY NOTHING FOR OF THEM HE HAS ENGAGED A HOST BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS
2989-138035-0009 NOR OF THE MANY OTHERS I HAVE OMITTED TO MENTION
2989-138035-0011 SO THAT THE LOVES OF THE TWO CHILDREN BASILIO AND QUITERIA
2989-138035-0012 HE ARRANGED A MATCH FOR HIS DAUGHTER WITH THE RICH CAMACHO
2989-138035-0014 BOWLS OVER THE NINE PINS AS IF BY MAGIC
2989-138035-0015 AND ABOVE ALL HANDLES A SWORD AS WELL AS THE BEST
2989-138035-0017 IF ALL THOSE WHO LOVE ONE ANOTHER WERE TO MARRY SAID DON QUIXOTE IT WOULD DEPRIVE PARENTS OF THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MARRY THEIR CHILDREN TO THE PROPER PERSON AND AT THE PROPER TIME AND IF IT WAS LEFT TO DAUGHTERS TO CHOOSE HUSBANDS AS THEY PLEASED
2989-138035-0018 ONE WOULD BE FOR CHOOSING HER FATHER'S SERVANT AND ANOTHER SOME ONE SHE HAS SEEN PASSING IN THE STREET AND FANCIES GALLANT AND DASHING THOUGH HE MAY BE A DRUNKEN BULLY
2989-138035-0020 WHY THEN SHOULD NOT HE DO THE SAME WHO HAS TO MAKE THE WHOLE JOURNEY OF LIFE DOWN TO THE FINAL HALTING PLACE OF DEATH MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE COMPANION HAS TO BE HIS COMPANION IN BED AT BOARD AND EVERYWHERE AS THE WIFE IS TO HER HUSBAND
2989-138035-0021 HE HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN TO SMILE OR HEARD TO UTTER RATIONAL WORD AND HE ALWAYS GOES ABOUT MOODY AND DEJECTED TALKING TO HIMSELF IN A WAY THAT SHOWS PLAINLY HE IS OUT OF HIS SENSES HE EATS LITTLE AND SLEEPS LITTLE AND ALL HE EATS IS FRUIT AND WHEN HE SLEEPS
2989-138035-0023 THAT HE MIGHT BE TAKEN FOR A CLOTHED STATUE WITH ITS DRAPERY STIRRED BY THE WIND IN SHORT HE SHOWS SUCH SIGNS OF A HEART CRUSHED BY SUFFERING THAT ALL WE WHO KNOW HIM
2989-138035-0024 AND ANY ONE OF THEM OR ANY MOMENT THE HOUSE MAY FALL I HAVE SEEN THE RAIN COMING DOWN AND THE SUN SHINING ALL AT ONE TIME
2989-138035-0026 FOR LOVE I HAVE HEARD SAY
2989-138035-0027 POVERTY WEALTH AND BLEAR EYES PEARLS WHAT ART THOU DRIVING AT SANCHO CURSES ON THEE SAID DON QUIXOTE
2989-138035-0029 BUT NO MATTER I UNDERSTAND MYSELF AND I KNOW I HAVE NOT SAID ANYTHING VERY FOOLISH IN WHAT I HAVE SAID ONLY YOUR WORSHIP SENOR IS ALWAYS GRAVELLING AT EVERYTHING I SAY NAY EVERYTHING I DO
2989-138035-0030 MAYBE THERE ARE TOLEDANS WHO DO NOT HIT IT OFF WHEN IT COMES TO POLISHED TALK THAT IS TRUE SAID THE LICENTIATE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN BRED UP IN THE TANNERIES
2989-138035-0032 THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE BEEN BORN IN MAJALAHONDA I SAY OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY WHO ARE NOT SO AND DISCRIMINATION IS THE GRAMMAR OF GOOD LANGUAGE IF IT BE ACCOMPANIED BY PRACTICE I SIRS FOR MY SINS HAVE STUDIED CANON LAW AT SALAMANCA
2989-138035-0033 WHERE YOU ARE NOW TAIL LOOK HERE BACHELOR CORCHUELO RETURNED THE LICENTIATE YOU HAVE THE MOST MISTAKEN IDEA IN THE WORLD ABOUT SKILL WITH THE SWORD IF YOU THINK IT USELESS IT IS NO IDEA ON MY PART BUT AN ESTABLISHED TRUTH
2989-138035-0035 WHO WILL MAKE ME TURN MY BACK AND THAT THERE IS NOT ONE IN THE WORLD I WILL NOT COMPEL TO GIVE GROUND AS TO WHETHER YOU TURN YOUR BACK OR NOT I DO NOT CONCERN MYSELF REPLIED THE MASTER OF FENCE
2989-138035-0036 THOUGH IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR GRAVE WOULD BE DUG ON THE SPOT WHERE YOU PLANTED YOUR FOOT THE FIRST TIME I MEAN THAT YOU WOULD BE STRETCHED DEAD THERE FOR DESPISING SKILL WITH THE SWORD
2989-138035-0038 THE END OF IT WAS THAT THE LICENTIATE RECKONED UP FOR HIM BY THRUSTS EVERY ONE OF THE BUTTONS OF THE SHORT CASSOCK HE WORE TORE THE SKIRTS INTO STRIPS LIKE THE TAILS OF A CUTTLEFISH KNOCKED OFF HIS HAT TWICE AND SO COMPLETELY TIRED HIM OUT
2989-138035-0039 THAT IN VEXATION ANGER AND RAGE HE TOOK THE SWORD BY THE HILT AND FLUNG IT AWAY WITH SUCH FORCE THAT ONE OF THE PEASANTS THAT WERE THERE WHO WAS A NOTARY AND WHO WENT FOR IT MADE AN AFFIDAVIT AFTERWARDS THAT HE SENT IT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF A LEAGUE
2989-138035-0041 THEY CAN PUT THE POINT OF A SWORD THROUGH THE EYE OF A NEEDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH HAVING TUMBLED OFF MY DONKEY SAID CORCHUELO AND WITH HAVING HAD THE TRUTH I WAS SO IGNORANT OF PROVED TO ME BY EXPERIENCE AND GETTING UP HE EMBRACED THE LICENTIATE
2989-138035-0042 AND THEY WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN EVER AND NOT CARING TO WAIT FOR THE NOTARY WHO HAD GONE FOR THE SWORD
2989-138035-0044 IT GREW DARK BUT BEFORE THEY REACHED THE TOWN IT SEEMED TO THEM ALL AS IF THERE WAS A HEAVEN FULL OF COUNTLESS GLITTERING STARS IN FRONT OF IT THEY HEARD TOO THE PLEASANT MINGLED NOTES OF A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS FLUTES DRUMS
2989-138035-0045 PSALTERIES PIPES
2989-138035-0047 OTHERS SINGING OTHERS PLAYING THE VARIOUS INSTRUMENTS ALREADY MENTIONED
2989-138035-0048 WERE FRISKING AND GAMBOLLING ALL OVER THE MEADOW
2989-138035-0050 AS THE GOOD QUARTERS HE HAD ENJOYED IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF DON DIEGO CAME BACK TO HIS MIND
2989-138035-0051 WHEREIN AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE WEDDING OF CAMACHO THE RICH TOGETHER WITH THE INCIDENT OF BASILIO THE POOR
2989-138035-0053 SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND CALLED TO HIS SQUIRE SANCHO WHO WAS STILL SNORING
2989-138035-0054 THAT WITHOUT ENVYING OR BEING ENVIED SLEEPEST
2989-138035-0056 SINCE UPON MY SHOULDERS THOU HAST LAID THE SUPPORT OF THYSELF THE COUNTERPOISE AND BURDEN THAT NATURE AND CUSTOM HAVE IMPOSED UPON MASTERS THE SERVANT SLEEPS AND THE MASTER LIES AWAKE THINKING HOW HE IS TO FEED HIM ADVANCE HIM AND REWARD HIM
2989-138035-0057 HE AWOKE AT LAST DROWSY AND LAZY AND CASTING HIS EYES ABOUT IN EVERY DIRECTION OBSERVED THERE COMES IF I DON'T MISTAKE
2989-138035-0059 LET HIM DO WHAT HE LIKES RETURNED SANCHO BE HE NOT POOR HE WOULD MARRY QUITERIA TO MAKE A GRAND MATCH FOR HIMSELF AND HE WITHOUT A FARTHING IS THERE NOTHING ELSE FAITH
2989-138035-0060 SENOR IT'S MY OPINION THE POOR MAN SHOULD BE CONTENT WITH WHAT HE CAN GET
2989-138035-0062 BUT WHEN SUCH GIFTS FALL TO ONE THAT HAS HARD CASH I WISH MY CONDITION OF LIFE WAS AS BECOMING AS THEY ARE
2989-138035-0063 FOR GOD'S SAKE SANCHO SAID DON QUIXOTE HERE
2989-138035-0065 AND EVEN IF IT WERE SO I DESIRE YOU TO HOLD YOUR TONGUE AND COME ALONG FOR THE INSTRUMENTS WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO ENLIVEN THE VALLEYS AGAIN AND NO DOUBT THE MARRIAGE WILL TAKE PLACE IN THE COOL OF THE MORNING AND NOT IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON
2989-138035-0066 AND SIX STEWPOTS THAT STOOD ROUND THE BLAZE HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN THE ORDINARY MOULD OF COMMON POTS FOR THEY WERE SIX HALF WINE JARS EACH FIT TO HOLD THE CONTENTS OF A SLAUGHTER HOUSE
2989-138035-0068 OF OVER SIX GALLONS EACH AND ALL FILLED AS IT PROVED AFTERWARDS WITH GENEROUS WINES THERE WERE BESIDES PILES OF THE WHITEST BREAD LIKE THE HEAPS OF CORN ONE SEES ON THE THRESHING FLOORS
2989-138035-0069 THERE WAS A WALL MADE OF CHEESES ARRANGED LIKE OPEN BRICK WORK AND TWO CAULDRONS FULL OF OIL
2989-138035-0071 THE SPICES OF DIFFERENT KINDS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY THE POUND BUT BY THE QUARTER AND ALL LAY OPEN TO VIEW IN A GREAT CHEST
2989-138035-0072 BUT ABUNDANT ENOUGH TO FEED AN ARMY
2989-138035-0074 GET DOWN AND LOOK ABOUT FOR A LADLE AND SKIM OFF A HEN OR TWO AND MUCH GOOD MAY THEY DO YOU I DON'T SEE ONE SAID SANCHO WAIT A BIT SAID THE COOK SINNER THAT I AM HOW PARTICULAR AND BASHFUL YOU ARE
2989-138035-0075 AND SO SAYING HE SEIZED A BUCKET AND PLUNGING IT INTO ONE OF THE HALF JARS TOOK UP THREE HENS AND A COUPLE OF GEESE
2989-138035-0077 WELL THEN SAID THE COOK TAKE SPOON AND ALL FOR CAMACHO'S WEALTH AND HAPPINESS FURNISH EVERYTHING

3112-9554-0013 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH HE HAD WRITTEN FOUR FIFTHS OF AN IRISH STORY CALLED THE LANDLEAGUERS SHORTLY ABOUT TO BE PUBLISHED AND HE LEFT IN MANUSCRIPT A COMPLETED NOVEL CALLED AN OLD MAN'S LOVE
3112-9554-0014 WHICH WILL BE PUBLISHED BY MESSRS BLACKWOOD AND SONS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR IN THE SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY MY FATHER LEFT LONDON AND WENT TO LIVE AT HARTING A VILLAGE IN SUSSEX BUT ON THE CONFINES OF HAMPSHIRE
3112-9554-0016 BUT HE WENT TO IRELAND TWICE IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO HE WENT THERE IN MAY OF THAT YEAR AND WAS THEN ABSENT NEARLY A MONTH THIS JOURNEY DID HIM MUCH GOOD FOR HE FOUND THAT THE SOFTER ATMOSPHERE RELIEVED HIS ASTHMA
3112-9554-0017 FROM WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUFFERING FOR NEARLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN AUGUST FOLLOWING HE MADE ANOTHER TRIP TO IRELAND BUT FROM THIS JOURNEY HE DERIVED LESS BENEFIT HE WAS MUCH INTERESTED IN AND WAS VERY MUCH DISTRESSED BY THE UNHAPPY CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY
3112-9554-0019 THE LANDLEAGUERS WHICH AS STATED ABOVE WAS UNFINISHED WHEN HE DIED THIS BOOK WAS A CAUSE OF ANXIETY TO HIM HE COULD NOT RID HIS MIND OF THE FACT THAT HE HAD A STORY ALREADY IN THE COURSE OF PUBLICATION BUT WHICH HE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED
3112-9554-0020 IN NO OTHER CASE EXCEPT FRAMLEY PARSONAGE DID MY FATHER PUBLISH EVEN THE FIRST NUMBER OF ANY NOVEL BEFORE HE HAD FULLY COMPLETED THE WHOLE TALE
3112-9554-0022 NEARLY FIVE WEEKS FROM THE NIGHT OF HIS ATTACK I HAVE BEEN LED TO SAY THESE FEW WORDS NOT AT ALL FROM A DESIRE TO SUPPLEMENT MY FATHER'S BIOGRAPHY OF HIMSELF BUT TO MENTION THE MAIN INCIDENTS IN HIS LIFE AFTER HE HAD FINISHED HIS OWN RECORD
3112-9554-0023 IN WHAT I HAVE HERE SAID I DO NOT THINK I HAVE EXCEEDED HIS INSTRUCTIONS
3112-9555-0001 OF SO INSIGNIFICANT A PERSON AS MYSELF IT WILL NOT BE SO MUCH MY INTENTION TO SPEAK OF THE LITTLE DETAILS OF MY PRIVATE LIFE AS OF WHAT I AND PERHAPS OTHERS ROUND ME HAVE DONE IN LITERATURE
3112-9555-0002 OF MY FAILURES AND SUCCESSES SUCH AS THEY HAVE BEEN AND THEIR CAUSES AND OF THE OPENING WHICH A LITERARY CAREER OFFERS TO MEN AND WOMEN FOR THE EARNING OF THEIR BREAD
3112-9555-0004 NOR WITHOUT DOING SO SHOULD I KNOW HOW TO THROW MY MATTER INTO ANY RECOGNISED AND INTELLIGIBLE FORM THAT I OR ANY MAN SHOULD TELL EVERYTHING OF HIMSELF I HOLD TO BE IMPOSSIBLE
3112-9555-0005 I WILL SET DOWN NAUGHT IN MALICE NOR WILL I GIVE TO MYSELF OR OTHERS HONOUR WHICH I DO NOT BELIEVE TO HAVE BEEN FAIRLY WON MY BOYHOOD WAS I THINK AS UNHAPPY AS THAT OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN COULD WELL BE
3112-9555-0007 I WAS BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN IN KEPPEL STREET RUSSELL SQUARE AND WHILE A BABY WAS CARRIED DOWN TO HARROW WHERE MY FATHER HAD BUILT A HOUSE ON A LARGE FARM
3112-9555-0008 AND PERHAPS THE DIRECTOR OF HER DESTINY AND OF OURS MY FATHER HAD BEEN A WYKAMIST AND A FELLOW OF NEW COLLEGE AND WINCHESTER WAS THE DESTINATION OF MY BROTHERS AND MYSELF
3112-9555-0010 CHAMBERS WHICH ON ONE MELANCHOLY OCCASION DID BECOME ABSOLUTELY SUICIDAL
3112-9555-0011 IN HIS EARLY DAYS HE WAS A MAN OF SOME SMALL FORTUNE AND OF HIGHER HOPES THESE STOOD SO HIGH AT THE TIME OF MY BIRTH THAT HE WAS FELT TO BE ENTITLED TO A COUNTRY HOUSE AS WELL AS TO THAT IN KEPPEL STREET
3112-9555-0013 BUT AT ANY RATE AS OTHER DAY BOARDERS I DO NOT SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE WELL TREATED BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE IGNOMINY WHICH I ENDURED
3112-9555-0014 I WAS ONLY SEVEN AND I THINK THAT BOYS AT SEVEN ARE NOW SPARED AMONG THEIR MORE CONSIDERATE SENIORS I WAS NEVER SPARED AND WAS NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO RUN TO AND FRO BETWEEN OUR HOUSE AND THE SCHOOL
3112-9555-0016 PERHAPS HE DID NOT RECOGNISE ME BY MY FACE AT THIS TIME I WAS THREE YEARS AT HARROW AND AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER I WAS THE JUNIOR BOY IN THE SCHOOL WHEN I LEFT IT
3112-9555-0017 THEN I WAS SENT TO A PRIVATE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY KEPT BY ARTHUR DRURY THIS I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN DONE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ADVICE OF HENRY DRURY WHO WAS MY TUTOR AT HARROW SCHOOL AND MY FATHER'S FRIEND
3112-9555-0019 THERE WERE EVER SO MANY OTHER PUNISHMENTS ACCUMULATED ON OUR HEADS IT BROKE MY HEART KNOWING MYSELF TO BE INNOCENT AND SUFFERING ALSO UNDER THE ALMOST EQUALLY PAINFUL FEELING THAT THE OTHER THREE NO DOUBT WICKED BOYS
3112-9555-0020 MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE THE LEADER OF WICKEDNESS ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE NEXT TERM HE WHISPERED TO ME HALF A WORD THAT PERHAPS HE HAD BEEN WRONG WITH ALL A STUPID BOY'S SLOWNESS I SAID NOTHING
3112-9555-0022 AT ANY RATE AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED I REMEMBER THEIR NAMES WELL AND ALMOST WISH TO WRITE THEM HERE WHEN I WAS TWELVE THERE CAME THE VACANCY AT WINCHESTER COLLEGE WHICH I WAS DESTINED TO FILL
3112-9555-0023 MY TWO ELDER BROTHERS HAD GONE THERE AND THE YOUNGER HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEING ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE LOST HIS CHANCE OF NEW COLLEGE IT HAD BEEN ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY FATHER'S LIFE THAT HIS THREE SONS WHO LIVED TO GO TO WINCHESTER
3112-9555-0025 MY ELDEST BROTHER ALL BUT ACHIEVED IT AND AFTERWARDS WENT TO OXFORD TAKING THREE EXHIBITIONS FROM THE SCHOOL THOUGH HE LOST THE GREAT GLORY OF A WYKAMIST HE HAS SINCE MADE HIMSELF WELL KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC AS A WRITER
3112-9555-0026 IN CONNECTION WITH ALL ITALIAN SUBJECTS
3112-9555-0028 IT IS ODD THAT A MAN SHOULD CONCEIVE AND IN THIS CASE A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND A VERY CLEVER MAN THAT FARMING SHOULD BE A BUSINESS IN WHICH HE MIGHT MAKE MONEY WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL EDUCATION OR APPRENTICESHIP
3112-9555-0029 PERHAPS OF ALL TRADES IT IS THE ONE IN WHICH AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THINGS SHOULD BE DONE AND THE BEST MANNER OF DOING THEM IS MOST NECESSARY AND IT IS ONE ALSO FOR SUCCESS IN WHICH A SUFFICIENT CAPITAL IS INDISPENSABLE
3112-9555-0031 I HAVE NO CLEAR KNOWLEDGE OF HER OBJECT OR OF MY FATHER'S BUT I BELIEVE THAT HE HAD AN IDEA THAT MONEY MIGHT BE MADE BY SENDING GOODS LITTLE GOODS SUCH AS PIN CUSHIONS PEPPER BOXES AND POCKET KNIVES OUT TO THE STILL UNFURNISHED STATES
3112-9555-0032 I HAVE SEEN IT SINCE IN THE TOWN OF CINCINNATI A SORRY BUILDING BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT IN THOSE DAYS IT WAS AN IMPOSING EDIFICE MY MOTHER WENT FIRST WITH MY SISTERS AND SECOND BROTHER
3112-9555-0034 THERE HAVE BEEN HOT WORDS BETWEEN US FOR PERFECT FRIENDSHIP BEARS AND ALLOWS HOT WORDS FEW BROTHERS HAVE HAD MORE OF BROTHERHOOD BUT IN THOSE SCHOOL DAYS HE WAS OF ALL MY FOES THE WORST
3112-9555-0035 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRACTICE OF THE COLLEGE WHICH SUBMITS OR DID THEN SUBMIT MUCH OF THE TUITION OF THE YOUNGER BOYS FROM THE ELDER HE WAS MY TUTOR AND IN HIS CAPACITY OF TEACHER AND RULER
3112-9555-0037 HANG A LITTLE BOY FOR STEALING APPLES HE USED TO SAY AND OTHER LITTLE BOYS WILL NOT STEAL APPLES THE DOCTRINE WAS ALREADY EXPLODED ELSEWHERE BUT HE STUCK TO IT WITH CONSERVATIVE ENERGY THE RESULT WAS THAT AS
3112-9555-0038 A PART OF HIS DAILY EXERCISE HE THRASHED ME WITH A BIG STICK THAT SUCH THRASHINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE AT A SCHOOL AS A CONTINUAL PART OF ONE'S DAILY LIFE
3112-9555-0040 THERE WAS OFTEN A DIFFICULTY ABOUT THE HOLIDAYS AS TO WHAT SHOULD BE DONE WITH ME ON THIS OCCASION MY AMUSEMENT CONSISTED IN WANDERING ABOUT AMONG THOSE OLD DESERTED BUILDINGS AND IN READING SHAKESPEARE OUT OF A BI COLUMNED EDITION
3112-9555-0041 WHICH IS STILL AMONG MY BOOKS IT WAS NOT THAT I HAD CHOSEN SHAKESPEARE BUT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE TO READ AFTER A WHILE MY BROTHER LEFT WINCHESTER AND ACCOMPANIED MY FATHER TO AMERICA
3112-9555-0043 BOOTS WAISTCOATS AND POCKET HANDKERCHIEFS WHICH WITH SOME SLIGHT SUPERVEILLANCE WERE AT THE COMMAND OF OTHER SCHOLARS WERE CLOSED LUXURIES TO ME MY SCHOOLFELLOWS OF COURSE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO AND I BECAME A PARIAH
3112-9555-0044 IT IS THE NATURE OF BOYS TO BE CRUEL I HAVE SOMETIMES DOUBTED WHETHER AMONG EACH OTHER THEY DO USUALLY SUFFER MUCH ONE FROM THE OTHER'S CRUELTY BUT I SUFFERED HORRIBLY
3112-9555-0046 OF COURSE I WAS ILL DRESSED AND DIRTY BUT AH HOW WELL I REMEMBER ALL THE AGONIES OF MY YOUNG HEART HOW I CONSIDERED WHETHER I SHOULD ALWAYS BE ALONE
3112-9555-0047 WHETHER I COULD NOT FIND MY WAY UP TO THE TOP OF THAT COLLEGE TOWER AND FROM THENCE PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING AND A WORSE THING CAME THAN THE STOPPAGE OF THE SUPPLIES FROM THE SHOPKEEPERS EVERY BOY HAD A SHILLING A WEEK POCKET MONEY WHICH WE CALLED BATTELS
3112-9555-0049 THE BATTELS FOR THE LAST HALF YEAR HAD NOT BEEN REPAID AND HE URGED HIS OWN UNWILLINGNESS TO ADVANCE THE MONEY THE LOSS OF A SHILLING A WEEK WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MUCH EVEN THOUGH POCKET MONEY FROM OTHER SOURCES NEVER REACHED ME
3112-9555-0050 AND NOW WHEN IT CAME TO THE TURN OF ANY SERVANT HE RECEIVED SIXTY NINE SHILLINGS INSTEAD OF SEVENTY AND THE CAUSE OF THE DEFALCATION WAS EXPLAINED TO HIM
3112-9555-0052 MY FATHER AT THIS TIME HAVING LEFT MY MOTHER AND SISTERS WITH MY YOUNGER BROTHER IN AMERICA TOOK HIMSELF TO LIVE AT A WRETCHED TUMBLE DOWN FARMHOUSE ON THE SECOND FARM HE HAD HIRED AND I WAS TAKEN THERE WITH HIM IT WAS NEARLY THREE MILES FROM HARROW
3112-9555-0053 AT HARROW WEALD BUT IN THE PARISH AND FROM THIS HOUSE I WAS AGAIN SENT TO THAT SCHOOL AS A DAY BOARDER LET THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IS THE USUAL APPEARANCE AND WHAT THE USUAL APPURTENANCES OF A BOY AT SUCH A SCHOOL
3112-9555-0055 BUT I PASSED MY MOST JOCUND HOURS IN THE KITCHEN MAKING INNOCENT LOVE TO THE BAILIFF'S DAUGHTER THE FARM KITCHEN MIGHT BE VERY WELL THROUGH THE EVENING WHEN THE HORRORS OF THE SCHOOL WERE OVER BUT IT ALL ADDED TO THE CRUELTY OF THE DAYS
3112-9555-0056 A SIZAR AT A CAMBRIDGE COLLEGE OR A BIBLE CLERK AT OXFORD HAS NOT PLEASANT DAYS OR USED NOT TO HAVE THEM HALF A CENTURY AGO BUT HIS POSITION WAS RECOGNISED AND THE MISERY WAS MEASURED
3112-9555-0058 THE ONLY EXPENSE EXCEPT THAT OF BOOKS TO WHICH A HOUSE BOARDER WAS THEN SUBJECT WAS THE FEE TO A TUTOR AMOUNTING I THINK TO TEN GUINEAS MY TUTOR TOOK ME WITHOUT THE FEE
3112-9555-0059 BUT WHEN I HEARD HIM DECLARE THE FACT IN THE PUPIL ROOM BEFORE THE BOYS I HARDLY FELT GRATEFUL FOR THE CHARITY I WAS NEVER A COWARD AND CARED FOR A THRASHING AS LITTLE AS ANY BOY
3112-9555-0061 AT LAST I WAS DRIVEN TO REBELLION AND THERE CAME A GREAT FIGHT AT THE END OF WHICH MY OPPONENT HAD TO BE TAKEN HOME FOR A WHILE IF THESE WORDS BE EVER PRINTED
3112-9555-0062 I TRUST THAT SOME SCHOOLFELLOW OF THOSE DAYS MAY STILL BE LEFT ALIVE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SAY THAT IN CLAIMING THIS SOLITARY GLORY OF MY SCHOOL DAYS I AM NOT MAKING A FALSE BOAST
3112-9555-0064 MY FATHER AND I LIVED TOGETHER HE HAVING NO MEANS OF LIVING EXCEPT WHAT CAME FROM THE FARM MY MEMORY TELLS ME THAT HE WAS ALWAYS IN DEBT TO HIS LANDLORD AND TO THE TRADESMEN HE EMPLOYED
3112-9555-0065 OF SELF INDULGENCE NO ONE COULD ACCUSE HIM OUR TABLE WAS POORER I THINK THAN THAT OF THE BAILIFF WHO STILL HUNG ON TO OUR SHATTERED FORTUNES THE FURNITURE WAS MEAN AND SCANTY
3112-9555-0067 IT WAS HIS AMBITION TO DESCRIBE ALL ECCLESIASTICAL TERMS INCLUDING THE DENOMINATIONS OF EVERY FRATERNITY OF MONKS AND EVERY CONVENT OF NUNS WITH ALL THEIR ORDERS AND SUBDIVISIONS
3112-9555-0068 UNDER CRUSHING DISADVANTAGES WITH FEW OR NO BOOKS OF REFERENCE WITH IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO NO LIBRARY HE WORKED AT HIS MOST UNGRATEFUL TASK WITH UNFLAGGING INDUSTRY WHEN HE DIED
3112-9555-0070 AND MY FATHER THOUGH HE WOULD TRY
3112-9555-0071 AND SAY MY EARLY RULES FROM THE LATIN GRAMMAR OR REPEAT THE GREEK ALPHABET AND WAS OBLIGED AT THESE EARLY LESSONS TO HOLD MY HEAD INCLINED TOWARDS HIM
3112-9555-0073 THOUGH I THINK NONE EVER KNEW LESS HOW TO GO ABOUT THE WORK OF AMUSEMENT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER HE NEVER RECOGNISED THE NEED
3112-9555-0074 HE COULD NOT GIVE HIS TIME TO TEACH ME FOR EVERY HOUR THAT HE WAS NOT IN THE FIELDS WAS DEVOTED TO HIS MONKS AND NUNS BUT HE WOULD REQUIRE ME TO SIT AT A TABLE WITH LEXICON AND GRADUS BEFORE ME
3112-9555-0076 IN THE OLD HOUSE WERE THE TWO FIRST VOLUMES OF COOPER'S NOVEL CALLED THE PRAIRIE A RELIC PROBABLY A DISHONEST RELIC OF SOME SUBSCRIPTION TO HOOKHAM'S LIBRARY OTHER BOOKS OF THE KIND THERE WAS NONE
3112-9555-0077 I WONDER HOW MANY DOZEN TIMES I READ THOSE TWO FIRST VOLUMES
3112-9555-0079 AND WHEN THERE IS A CHARM IN WALKING BUT HERE WERE THE SAME LANES FOUR TIMES A DAY IN WET AND DRY IN HEAT AND SUMMER WITH ALL THE ACCOMPANYING MUD AND DUST AND WITH DISORDERED CLOTHES
3112-9555-0080 BUT HIS SUCCESSOR LIVED TO BE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY I THINK IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY ONE THAT MY MOTHER WITH THE REST OF THE FAMILY RETURNED FROM AMERICA
3112-9555-0082 NOT TO THE FIRST HOUSE WHICH WOULD STILL HAVE BEEN BEYOND HER MEANS BUT TO THAT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN CALLED ORLEY FARM AND WHICH WAS AN EDEN AS COMPARED TO OUR ABODE AT HARROW WEALD
3112-9555-0083 HERE MY SCHOOLING WENT ON UNDER SOMEWHAT IMPROVED CIRCUMSTANCES THE THREE MILES BECAME HALF A MILE AND PROBABLY SOME SALUTARY CHANGES WERE MADE IN MY WARDROBE
3112-9555-0085 I HAVE FELT THAT I HAD NO RIGHT TO TALK OF THINGS FROM MOST OF WHICH I WAS KEPT IN ESTRANGEMENT THROUGH ALL MY FATHER'S TROUBLES HE STILL DESIRED TO SEND ME EITHER TO OXFORD OR CAMBRIDGE
3112-9555-0086 AND VERY FORTUNATE IT WAS THAT I DID NOT SUCCEED FOR MY CAREER WITH SUCH ASSISTANCE ONLY AS A SCHOLARSHIP WOULD HAVE GIVEN ME WOULD HAVE ENDED IN DEBT AND IGNOMINY WHEN I LEFT HARROW I WAS ALL BUT NINETEEN
3112-9555-0088 AT THE SCHOOL AT SUNBURY THERE WAS CERTAINLY A WRITING MASTER AND A FRENCH MASTER THE LATTER WAS AN EXTRA AND I NEVER HAD EXTRAS
3112-9555-0089 I SUPPOSE I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE WRITING MASTER'S CLASS BUT THOUGH I CAN CALL TO MIND THE MAN I CANNOT CALL TO MIND HIS FERULE IT WAS BY THEIR FERULES THAT I ALWAYS KNEW THEM AND THEY ME
3112-9555-0091 AND I HAVE OFTEN BOASTED THAT I OBTAINED THEM ALL LOOKING BACK OVER HALF A CENTURY
3112-9555-0092 I AM NOW A FAIR LATIN SCHOLAR THAT IS TO SAY I READ AND ENJOY THE LATIN CLASSICS AND COULD PROBABLY MAKE MYSELF UNDERSTOOD IN LATIN PROSE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE WHICH I HAVE I HAVE ACQUIRED SINCE I LEFT SCHOOL
3168-173564-0000 SONYA AND MADAME SCHOSS WHO HAD NOT YET UNDRESSED WENT OUT WITH HIM ONLY NATASHA AND THE COUNTESS REMAINED IN THE ROOM PETYA WAS NO LONGER WITH THE FAMILY
3168-173564-0001 WHICH WAS MAKING FOR TROITSA THE COUNTESS ON HEARING THAT MOSCOW WAS ON FIRE BEGAN TO CRY NATASHA PALE WITH A FIXED LOOK WAS SITTING ON THE BENCH UNDER THE ICONS JUST WHERE SHE HAD SAT DOWN ON ARRIVING
3168-173564-0003 THERE'S AN AWFUL GLOW NATASHA DO LOOK YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE WINDOW SHE SAID TO HER COUSIN EVIDENTLY WISHING TO DISTRACT HER MIND BUT NATASHA LOOKED AT HER AS IF NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS SAID TO HER
3168-173564-0004 AND AGAIN FIXED HER EYES ON THE CORNER OF THE STOVE SHE HAD BEEN IN THIS CONDITION OF STUPOR SINCE THE MORNING WHEN SONYA TO THE SURPRISE AND ANNOYANCE OF THE COUNTESS HAD FOR SOME UNACCOUNTABLE REASON
3168-173564-0006 PAID UNCEASING ATTENTION TO HER COUSIN LOOK NATASHA HOW DREADFULLY IT IS BURNING SAID SHE WHAT'S BURNING ASKED NATASHA OH YES MOSCOW
3168-173564-0007 AND AS IF IN ORDER NOT TO OFFEND SONYA AND TO GET RID OF HER SHE TURNED HER FACE TO THE WINDOW LOOKED OUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING AND AGAIN SETTLED DOWN IN HER FORMER ATTITUDE
3168-173564-0009 NOR ANYTHING ELSE COULD SEEM OF IMPORTANCE TO NATASHA THE COUNT RETURNED AND LAY DOWN BEHIND THE PARTITION THE COUNTESS WENT UP TO HER DAUGHTER AND TOUCHED HER HEAD WITH THE BACK OF HER HAND AS SHE WAS WONT TO DO WHEN NATASHA WAS ILL
3168-173564-0010 THEN TOUCHED HER FOREHEAD WITH HER LIPS AS IF TO FEEL WHETHER SHE WAS FEVERISH AND FINALLY KISSED HER YOU ARE COLD
3168-173564-0012 WHERE WAS HE GOING HOW WAS HE WOUNDED WAS IT SERIOUS AND COULD SHE SEE HIM BUT AFTER SHE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT SEE HIM THAT HE WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED BUT THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER SHE CEASED TO ASK QUESTIONS OR TO SPEAK AT ALL
3168-173564-0013 EVIDENTLY DISBELIEVING WHAT THEY TOLD HER AND CONVINCED THAT SAY WHAT SHE MIGHT SHE WOULD STILL BE TOLD THE SAME ALL THE WAY SHE HAD SAT MOTIONLESS IN A CORNER OF THE COACH WITH WIDE OPEN EYES
3168-173564-0015 DECIDING OR HAD ALREADY DECIDED SOMETHING IN HER MIND THE COUNTESS KNEW THIS BUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE SHE DID NOT KNOW AND THIS ALARMED AND TORMENTED HER NATASHA UNDRESS DARLING LIE DOWN ON MY BED
3168-173564-0016 A BED HAD BEEN MADE ON A BEDSTEAD FOR THE COUNTESS ONLY MADAME SCHOSS AND THE TWO GIRLS WERE TO SLEEP ON SOME HAY ON THE FLOOR NO MAMMA I WILL LIE DOWN HERE ON THE FLOOR NATASHA REPLIED IRRITABLY
3168-173564-0018 NATASHA KNEW IT WAS NOT PRINCE ANDREW WHO WAS MOANING SHE KNEW PRINCE ANDREW WAS IN THE SAME YARD AS THEMSELVES AND IN A PART OF THE HUT ACROSS THE PASSAGE BUT THIS DREADFUL INCESSANT MOANING MADE HER SOB
3168-173564-0019 THE COUNTESS EXCHANGED A LOOK WITH SONYA LIE DOWN DARLING LIE DOWN MY PET SAID THE COUNTESS SOFTLY TOUCHING NATASHA'S SHOULDERS COME LIE DOWN OH YES
3168-173564-0021 THAT HAD BEEN MADE UP ON THE FLOOR JERKED HER THIN AND RATHER SHORT PLAIT OF HAIR TO THE FRONT AND BEGAN REPLAITING IT
3168-173564-0022 HER LONG THIN PRACTICED FINGERS RAPIDLY UNPLAITED REPLAITED AND TIED UP HER PLAIT HER HEAD MOVED FROM SIDE TO SIDE FROM HABIT BUT HER EYES FEVERISHLY WIDE
3168-173564-0024 DO LIE DOWN SHE ADDED CROSSLY AND BURIED HER FACE IN THE PILLOW THE COUNTESS MADAME SCHOSS AND SONYA UNDRESSED HASTILY AND LAY DOWN THE SMALL LAMP IN FRONT OF THE ICONS WAS THE ONLY LIGHT LEFT IN THE ROOM
3168-173564-0025 BUT IN THE YARD THERE WAS A LIGHT FROM THE FIRE AT LITTLE MYTISHCHI A MILE AND A HALF AWAY AND THROUGH THE NIGHT CAME THE NOISE OF PEOPLE SHOUTING AT A TAVERN MAMONOV'S COSSACKS HAD SET UP ACROSS THE STREET AND THE ADJUTANT'S UNCEASING MOANS
3168-173564-0027 AND SONYA'S GENTLE BREATHING THEN THE COUNTESS CALLED TO NATASHA NATASHA DID NOT ANSWER I THINK SHE'S ASLEEP MAMMA SAID SONYA SOFTLY
3168-173564-0028 AFTER A SHORT SILENCE THE COUNTESS SPOKE AGAIN BUT THIS TIME NO ONE REPLIED SOON AFTER THAT NATASHA HEARD HER MOTHER'S EVEN BREATHING NATASHA DID NOT MOVE THOUGH HER LITTLE BARE FOOT
3168-173564-0030 THE SHOUTING IN THE TAVERN HAD DIED DOWN ONLY THE MOANING OF THE ADJUTANT WAS HEARD NATASHA SAT UP SONYA ARE YOU ASLEEP MAMMA SHE WHISPERED
3168-173564-0031 NO ONE REPLIED NATASHA ROSE SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY CROSSED HERSELF AND STEPPED CAUTIOUSLY ON THE COLD AND DIRTY FLOOR WITH HER SLIM SUPPLE BARE FEET THE BOARDS OF THE FLOOR CREAKED
3168-173564-0033 IT WAS HER OWN HEART SINKING WITH ALARM AND TERROR AND OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND STEPPED ACROSS THE THRESHOLD AND ONTO THE COLD DAMP EARTHEN FLOOR OF THE PASSAGE THE COLD SHE FELT REFRESHED HER
3168-173564-0034 WITH HER BARE FEET SHE TOUCHED A SLEEPING MAN STEPPED OVER HIM AND OPENED THE DOOR INTO THE PART OF THE HUT WHERE PRINCE ANDREW LAY IT WAS DARK IN THERE IN THE FARTHEST CORNER ON A BENCH BESIDE A BED
3168-173564-0036 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHY SHE HAD TO SHE KNEW THE MEETING WOULD BE PAINFUL
3168-173564-0037 ALL DAY SHE HAD LIVED ONLY IN HOPE OF SEEING HIM THAT NIGHT BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME SHE WAS FILLED WITH DREAD OF WHAT SHE MIGHT SEE HOW WAS HE MAIMED WHAT WAS LEFT OF HIM
3168-173564-0039 RAISED UNDER THE QUILT FOR HIS SHOULDERS SHE IMAGINED A HORRIBLE BODY THERE AND STOOD STILL IN TERROR BUT AN IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE DREW HER FORWARD SHE CAUTIOUSLY TOOK ONE STEP AND THEN ANOTHER
3168-173564-0040 AND FOUND HERSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF A SMALL ROOM CONTAINING BAGGAGE ANOTHER MAN TIMOKHIN WAS LYING IN A CORNER ON THE BENCHES BENEATH THE ICONS AND TWO OTHERS THE DOCTOR AND A VALET LAY ON THE FLOOR
3168-173564-0042 DRESSING JACKET AND NIGHTCAP THE VALET'S SLEEPY FRIGHTENED EXCLAMATION
3168-173564-0043 HORRIBLY UNLIKE A MAN AS THAT BODY LOOKED SHE MUST SEE HIM SHE PASSED THE VALET THE SNUFF FELL FROM THE CANDLE WICK AND SHE SAW PRINCE ANDREW CLEARLY WITH HIS ARMS OUTSIDE THE QUILT
3168-173564-0045 REVEALED BY THE TURN DOWN COLLAR OF HIS SHIRT GAVE HIM A PECULIARLY INNOCENT CHILDLIKE LOOK SUCH AS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ON HIM BEFORE SHE WENT UP TO HIM AND WITH A SWIFT FLEXIBLE YOUTHFUL MOVEMENT DROPPED ON HER KNEES
3168-173565-0000 SEVEN DAYS HAD PASSED SINCE PRINCE ANDREW FOUND HIMSELF IN THE AMBULANCE STATION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO HIS FEVERISH STATE AND THE INFLAMMATION OF HIS BOWELS WHICH WERE INJURED
3168-173565-0002 HAD BEEN FAIRLY WARM AND HE HAD REMAINED IN THE CALECHE BUT AT MYTISHCHI THE WOUNDED MAN HIMSELF ASKED TO BE TAKEN OUT AND GIVEN SOME TEA THE PAIN CAUSED BY HIS REMOVAL INTO THE HUT HAD MADE HIM GROAN ALOUD AND AGAIN LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS
3168-173565-0003 WHEN HE HAD BEEN PLACED ON HIS CAMP BED HE LAY FOR A LONG TIME MOTIONLESS WITH CLOSED EYES THEN HE OPENED THEM AND WHISPERED SOFTLY AND THE TEA HIS REMEMBERING SUCH A SMALL DETAIL OF EVERYDAY LIFE ASTONISHED THE DOCTOR
3168-173565-0005 TIMOKHIN THE RED NOSED MAJOR OF PRINCE ANDREW'S REGIMENT HAD JOINED HIM IN MOSCOW AND WAS BEING TAKEN ALONG WITH HIM HAVING BEEN WOUNDED IN THE LEG AT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO THEY WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A DOCTOR
3168-173565-0006 PRINCE ANDREW'S VALET HIS COACHMAN AND TWO ORDERLIES THEY GAVE PRINCE ANDREW SOME TEA HE DRANK IT EAGERLY LOOKING WITH FEVERISH EYES AT THE DOOR IN FRONT OF HIM AS IF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND REMEMBER SOMETHING
3168-173565-0008 PRINCE ANDREW AGAIN PONDERED AS IF TRYING TO REMEMBER SOMETHING COULDN'T ONE GET A BOOK HE ASKED WHAT BOOK THE GOSPELS I HAVEN'T ONE
3168-173565-0009 THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO PROCURE IT FOR HIM AND BEGAN TO ASK HOW HE WAS FEELING PRINCE ANDREW ANSWERED ALL HIS QUESTIONS RELUCTANTLY BUT REASONABLY
3168-173565-0011 THAT CAME FROM THE WOUND BEGAN EXAMINING THAT DREADFUL PLACE THE DOCTOR WAS VERY MUCH DISPLEASED ABOUT SOMETHING AND MADE A CHANGE IN THE DRESSINGS TURNING THE WOUNDED MAN OVER SO THAT HE GROANED AGAIN AND GREW UNCONSCIOUS AND DELIRIOUS FROM THE AGONY
3168-173565-0012 HE KEPT ASKING THEM TO GET HIM THE BOOK AND PUT IT UNDER HIM WHAT TROUBLE WOULD IT BE TO YOU HE SAID
3168-173565-0014 THAT I WONDER HOW HE CAN BEAR IT BY THE LORD JESUS CHRIST I THOUGHT WE HAD PUT SOMETHING UNDER HIM SAID THE VALET THE FIRST TIME PRINCE ANDREW UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS AND WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM AND REMEMBERED BEING WOUNDED AND HOW
3168-173565-0015 WAS WHEN HE ASKED TO BE CARRIED INTO THE HUT AFTER HIS CALECHE HAD STOPPED AT MYTISHCHI AFTER GROWING CONFUSED FROM PAIN WHILE BEING CARRIED INTO THE HUT HE AGAIN REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHILE DRINKING TEA ONCE MORE RECALLED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM
3168-173565-0017 THOUGHTS THOUGH NOW VAGUE AND INDEFINITE AGAIN POSSESSED HIS SOUL HE REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD NOW A NEW SOURCE OF HAPPINESS AND THAT THIS HAPPINESS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE GOSPELS THAT WAS WHY HE ASKED FOR A COPY OF THEM
3168-173565-0018 THE UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION IN WHICH THEY HAD PUT HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AGAIN CONFUSED HIS THOUGHTS AND WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF A THIRD TIME IT WAS IN THE COMPLETE STILLNESS OF THE NIGHT EVERYBODY NEAR HIM WAS SLEEPING A CRICKET CHIRPED FROM ACROSS THE PASSAGE
3168-173565-0020 HIS MIND WAS NOT IN A NORMAL STATE A HEALTHY MAN USUALLY THINKS OF FEELS AND REMEMBERS INNUMERABLE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT HAS THE POWER AND WILL TO SELECT ONE SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS OR EVENTS ON WHICH TO FIX HIS WHOLE ATTENTION
3168-173565-0021 A HEALTHY MAN CAN TEAR HIMSELF AWAY FROM THE DEEPEST REFLECTIONS TO SAY A CIVIL WORD TO SOMEONE WHO COMES IN AND CAN THEN RETURN AGAIN TO HIS OWN THOUGHTS
3168-173565-0023 IT HAD NEVER REACHED WHEN HE WAS IN HEALTH BUT SUDDENLY IN THE MIDST OF ITS WORK IT WOULD TURN TO SOME UNEXPECTED IDEA AND HE HAD NOT THE STRENGTH TO TURN IT BACK AGAIN YES A NEW HAPPINESS WAS REVEALED TO ME OF WHICH MAN CANNOT BE DEPRIVED
3168-173565-0024 HE THOUGHT AS HE LAY IN THE SEMIDARKNESS OF THE QUIET HUT GAZING FIXEDLY BEFORE HIM WITH FEVERISH WIDE OPEN EYES A HAPPINESS LYING BEYOND MATERIAL FORCES OUTSIDE THE MATERIAL INFLUENCES THAT ACT ON MAN
3168-173565-0026 AND PRINCE ANDREW HEARD WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER IT WAS A DELUSION OR REALITY A SOFT WHISPERING VOICE INCESSANTLY AND RHYTHMICALLY REPEATING PITI PITI PITI AND THEN
3168-173565-0027 AND TI TI ONCE MORE AT THE SAME TIME HE FELT THAT ABOVE HIS FACE ABOVE THE VERY MIDDLE OF IT SOME STRANGE AIRY STRUCTURE WAS BEING ERECTED OUT OF SLENDER NEEDLES OR SPLINTERS
3168-173565-0029 WHISPERED RHYTHMIC MUSIC IT STRETCHES STRETCHES SPREADING OUT AND STRETCHING SAID PRINCE ANDREW TO HIMSELF WHILE LISTENING TO THIS WHISPERING AND FEELING THE SENSATION OF THIS DRAWING OUT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS EDIFICE OF NEEDLES
3168-173565-0030 HE ALSO SAW BY GLIMPSES A RED HALO ROUND THE CANDLE AND HEARD THE RUSTLE OF THE COCKROACHES AND THE BUZZING OF THE FLY THAT FLOPPED AGAINST HIS PILLOW AND HIS FACE
3168-173565-0032 WHICH ALSO OPPRESSED HIM BUT PERHAPS THAT'S MY SHIRT ON THE TABLE HE THOUGHT AND THAT'S MY LEGS AND THAT IS THE DOOR BUT WHY IS IT ALWAYS STRETCHING AND DRAWING ITSELF OUT AND
3168-173565-0033 PITI PITI PITI AND TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI THAT'S ENOUGH PLEASE LEAVE OFF PRINCE ANDREW PAINFULLY ENTREATED SOMEONE AND SUDDENLY THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AGAIN SWAM TO THE SURFACE OF HIS MIND WITH PECULIAR CLEARNESS AND FORCE
3168-173565-0035 NOW AGAIN I FEEL THAT BLISS TO LOVE ONE'S NEIGHBORS
3168-173565-0036 BUT AN ENEMY CAN ONLY BE LOVED BY DIVINE LOVE
3168-173565-0038 YET HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I HATED IN MY LIFE AND OF THEM ALL I LOVED AND HATED NONE AS I DID HER
3168-173565-0039 NOT AS HE HAD DONE IN THE PAST WITH NOTHING BUT HER CHARMS WHICH GAVE HIM DELIGHT BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME PICTURING TO HIMSELF HER SOUL AND HE UNDERSTOOD HER FEELINGS HER SUFFERINGS SHAME AND REMORSE
3168-173565-0041 TI TI AND PITI PITI PITI BOOM FLOPPED THE FLY AND HIS ATTENTION WAS SUDDENLY CARRIED INTO ANOTHER WORLD
3168-173565-0042 AND DELIRIUM IN WHICH SOMETHING PARTICULAR WAS HAPPENING IN THAT WORLD SOME STRUCTURE WAS STILL BEING ERECTED AND DID NOT FALL SOMETHING WAS STILL STRETCHING OUT AND THE CANDLE WITH ITS RED HALO WAS STILL BURNING
3168-173565-0044 OH HOW OPPRESSIVE THIS CONTINUAL DELIRIUM IS THOUGHT PRINCE ANDREW TRYING TO DRIVE THAT FACE FROM HIS IMAGINATION BUT THE FACE REMAINED BEFORE HIM WITH THE FORCE OF REALITY AND DREW NEARER
3168-173565-0045 BUT HE COULD NOT AND DELIRIUM DREW HIM BACK INTO ITS DOMAIN THE SOFT WHISPERING VOICE CONTINUED ITS RHYTHMIC MURMUR SOMETHING OPPRESSED HIM AND STRETCHED OUT AND THE STRANGE FACE WAS BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0047 WHEN HE CAME TO HIMSELF NATASHA THAT SAME LIVING NATASHA WHOM OF ALL PEOPLE HE MOST LONGED TO LOVE WITH THIS NEW PURE DIVINE LOVE THAT HAD BEEN REVEALED TO HIM WAS KNEELING BEFORE HIM
3168-173565-0048 HE REALIZED THAT IT WAS THE REAL LIVING NATASHA AND HE WAS NOT SURPRISED BUT QUIETLY HAPPY NATASHA MOTIONLESS ON HER KNEES SHE WAS UNABLE TO STIR
3168-173565-0050 AND HELD OUT HIS HAND YOU HE SAID HOW FORTUNATE WITH A RAPID BUT CAREFUL MOVEMENT NATASHA DREW NEARER TO HIM ON HER KNEES AND TAKING HIS HAND CAREFULLY
3168-173565-0051 JUST TOUCHING IT LIGHTLY WITH HER LIPS FORGIVE ME SHE WHISPERED RAISING HER HEAD AND GLANCING AT HIM FORGIVE ME I LOVE YOU SAID PRINCE ANDREW
3168-173565-0053 BROKEN WHISPER AND BEGAN KISSING HIS HAND MORE RAPIDLY JUST TOUCHING IT WITH HER LIPS I LOVE YOU MORE BETTER THAN BEFORE SAID PRINCE ANDREW LIFTING HER FACE WITH HIS HAND
3168-173565-0054 SO AS TO LOOK INTO HER EYES THOSE EYES FILLED WITH HAPPY TEARS GAZED AT HIM TIMIDLY COMPASSIONATELY AND WITH JOYOUS LOVE NATASHA'S THIN PALE FACE WITH ITS SWOLLEN LIPS
3168-173565-0056 TIMOKHIN WHO HAD NOT SLEPT AT ALL BECAUSE OF THE PAIN IN HIS LEG HAD LONG BEEN WATCHING ALL THAT WAS GOING ON CAREFULLY COVERING HIS BARE BODY WITH THE SHEET AS HE HUDDLED UP ON HIS BENCH WHAT'S THIS SAID THE DOCTOR RISING FROM HIS BED
3168-173565-0057 PLEASE GO AWAY MADAM AT THAT MOMENT A MAID SENT BY THE COUNTESS WHO HAD NOTICED HER DAUGHTER'S ABSENCE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR LIKE A SOMNAMBULIST
3168-173565-0059 AND THE DOCTOR HAD TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD NOT EXPECTED FROM A YOUNG GIRL EITHER SUCH FIRMNESS OR SUCH SKILL IN NURSING A WOUNDED MAN DREADFUL AS THE COUNTESS IMAGINED IT WOULD BE SHOULD PRINCE ANDREW DIE IN HER DAUGHTER'S ARMS DURING THE JOURNEY
3168-173565-0060 AS JUDGING BY WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID IT SEEMED MIGHT EASILY HAPPEN SHE COULD NOT OPPOSE NATASHA THOUGH WITH THE INTIMACY NOW ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THE WOUNDED MAN AND NATASHA THE THOUGHT OCCURRED THAT SHOULD HE RECOVER THEIR FORMER ENGAGEMENT WOULD BE RENEWED
3214-167602-0000 HE SAW THAT HIS HERO AND COMMANDER WAS FOLLOWING QUITE A DIFFERENT TRAIN OF THOUGHT ROSTOV GLANCED ANGRILY AT ILYIN AND WITHOUT REPLYING STRODE OFF WITH RAPID STEPS TO THE VILLAGE I'LL SHOW THEM I'LL GIVE IT TO THEM THE BRIGANDS SAID HE TO HIMSELF
3214-167602-0001 WHAT DECISION HAVE YOU BEEN PLEASED TO COME TO SAID HE ROSTOV STOPPED
3214-167602-0003 AND YOU CAN'T MANAGE THEM YOU'RE A TRAITOR YOURSELF I KNOW YOU I'LL FLAY YOU ALL ALIVE AND AS IF AFRAID OF WASTING HIS STORE OF ANGER HE LEFT ALPATYCH AND WENT RAPIDLY FORWARD ALPATYCH MASTERING HIS OFFENDED FEELINGS KEPT PACE WITH ROSTOV AT A GLIDING GAIT
3214-167602-0004 AND CONTINUED TO IMPART HIS VIEWS HE SAID THE PEASANTS WERE OBDURATE AND THAT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO OVERRESIST THEM WITHOUT AN ARMED FORCE AND WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER FIRST TO SEND FOR THE MILITARY I'LL GIVE THEM ARMED FORCE
3214-167602-0006 THE PEASANTS IN THE CROWD WERE SIMILARLY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY SAW ROSTOV'S RAPID FIRM STEPS AND RESOLUTE FROWNING FACE AFTER THE HUSSARS HAD COME TO THE VILLAGE AND ROSTOV HAD GONE TO SEE THE PRINCESS A CERTAIN CONFUSION AND DISSENSION HAD ARISEN AMONG THE CROWD
3214-167602-0007 SOME OF THE PEASANTS SAID THAT THESE NEW ARRIVALS WERE RUSSIANS AND MIGHT TAKE IT AMISS THAT THE MISTRESS WAS BEING DETAINED DRON WAS OF THIS OPINION BUT AS SOON AS HE EXPRESSED IT KARP AND OTHERS ATTACKED THEIR EX ELDER HOW MANY YEARS HAVE YOU BEEN FATTENING ON THE COMMUNE
3214-167602-0009 YOU BEGRUDGED YOUR LUMP OF A SON A LITTLE OLD MAN SUDDENLY BEGAN ATTACKING DRON
3214-167602-0010 KARP THRUSTING HIS FINGERS INTO HIS BELT AND SMILING A LITTLE WALKED TO THE FRONT DRON ON THE CONTRARY RETIRED TO THE REAR AND THE CROWD DREW CLOSER TOGETHER
3214-167602-0012 BUT BEFORE THE WORDS WERE WELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH HIS CAP FLEW OFF AND A FIERCE BLOW JERKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE CAPS OFF TRAITORS SHOUTED ROSTOV IN A WRATHFUL VOICE WHERE'S THE ELDER HE CRIED FURIOUSLY THE ELDER HE WANTS THE ELDER
3214-167602-0013 MEEK AND FLUSTERED VOICES HERE AND THERE WERE HEARD CALLING
3214-167602-0015 UNMEANINGLY IN A VOICE NOT HIS OWN GRIPPING KARP BY THE COLLAR BIND HIM BIND HIM HE SHOUTED
3214-167602-0016 LAVRUSHKA HOWEVER RAN UP TO KARP AND SEIZED HIM BY THE ARMS FROM BEHIND SHALL I CALL UP OUR MEN FROM BEYOND THE HILL HE CALLED OUT
3214-167602-0018 SHOUTED ROSTOV AS IF THAT ORDER TOO COULD NOT POSSIBLY MEET WITH ANY OPPOSITION AND IN FACT TWO MORE PEASANTS BEGAN BINDING DRON WHO TOOK OFF HIS OWN BELT AND HANDED IT TO THEM AS IF TO AID THEM AND YOU ALL LISTEN TO ME SAID ROSTOV TO THE PEASANTS
3214-167602-0019 BE OFF TO YOUR HOUSES AT ONCE AND DON'T LET ONE OF YOUR VOICES BE HEARD WHY WE'VE NOT DONE ANY HARM WE DID IT JUST OUT OF FOOLISHNESS IT'S ALL NONSENSE I SAID THEN THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER VOICES WERE HEARD BICKERING WITH ONE ANOTHER
3214-167602-0021 TWO HOURS LATER THE CARTS WERE STANDING IN THE COURTYARD OF THE BOGUCHAROVO HOUSE THE PEASANTS WERE BRISKLY CARRYING OUT THE PROPRIETOR'S GOODS AND PACKING THEM ON THE CARTS AND DRON LIBERATED AT PRINCESS MARY'S WISH FROM THE CUPBOARD WHERE HE HAD BEEN CONFINED
3214-167602-0022 WAS STANDING IN THE YARD DIRECTING THE MEN DON'T PUT IT IN SO CARELESSLY SAID ONE OF THE PEASANTS
3214-167602-0024 LOOK HERE PUT IT UNDER THE BAST MATTING AND COVER IT WITH HAY THAT'S THE WAY
3214-167602-0025 DON'T CATCH UP AGAINST IT IT'S HEAVY LADS SOLID BOOKS YES THEY WORKED ALL DAY AND DIDN'T PLAY REMARKED THE TALL ROUND FACED PEASANT GRAVELY POINTING WITH A SIGNIFICANT WINK AT THE DICTIONARIES THAT WERE ON THE TOP
3214-167602-0027 AT THE INN AT YANKOVO HE RESPECTFULLY TOOK LEAVE OF HER FOR THE FIRST TIME PERMITTING HIMSELF TO KISS HER HAND HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO HE BLUSHINGLY REPLIED TO PRINCESS MARY'S EXPRESSIONS OF GRATITUDE FOR HER DELIVERANCE AS SHE TERMED WHAT HAD OCCURRED
3214-167602-0028 SAID HE WITH A SENSE OF SHAME AND WISHING TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT
3214-167602-0030 THANKED HIM WITH THE WHOLE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE RADIANT WITH GRATITUDE AND TENDERNESS SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO THANK HIM FOR ON THE CONTRARY IT SEEMED TO HER CERTAIN THAT HAD HE NOT BEEN THERE SHE WOULD HAVE PERISHED AT THE HANDS OF THE MUTINEERS AND OF THE FRENCH
3214-167602-0031 HONEST EYES WITH THE TEARS RISING IN THEM WHEN SHE HERSELF HAD BEGUN TO CRY AS SHE SPOKE OF HER LOSS DID NOT LEAVE HER MEMORY WHEN SHE HAD TAKEN LEAVE OF HIM AND REMAINED ALONE SHE SUDDENLY FELT HER EYES FILLING WITH TEARS
3214-167602-0033 WOULD PERHAPS NEVER LOVE HER SHE COMFORTED HERSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW IT AND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE TO BLAME IF WITHOUT EVER SPEAKING OF IT TO ANYONE SHE CONTINUED TO THE END OF HER LIFE TO LOVE THE MAN WITH WHOM SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HER LIFE
3214-167602-0034 SOMETIMES WHEN SHE RECALLED HIS LOOKS HIS SYMPATHY AND HIS WORDS HAPPINESS DID NOT APPEAR IMPOSSIBLE TO HER IT WAS AT THOSE MOMENTS THAT DUNYASHA NOTICED HER SMILING AS SHE LOOKED OUT OF THE CARRIAGE WINDOW WAS IT NOT FATE THAT BROUGHT HIM TO BOGUCHAROVO AND AT THAT VERY MOMENT THOUGHT PRINCESS MARY
3214-167602-0036 RALLIED HIM ON HAVING GONE TO LOOK FOR HAY AND HAVING PICKED UP ONE OF THE WEALTHIEST HEIRESSES IN RUSSIA HE GREW ANGRY IT MADE HIM ANGRY JUST BECAUSE THE IDEA OF MARRYING THE GENTLE PRINCESS MARY WHO WAS ATTRACTIVE TO HIM
3214-167602-0037 AND HAD AN ENORMOUS FORTUNE HAD AGAINST HIS WILL MORE THAN ONCE ENTERED HIS HEAD FOR HIMSELF PERSONALLY NICHOLAS COULD NOT WISH FOR A BETTER WIFE BY MARRYING HER HE WOULD MAKE THE COUNTESS HIS MOTHER HAPPY WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIS FATHER'S AFFAIRS IN ORDER
3214-167606-0001 ON THE CONTRARY HE WAS GLAD THAT LADIES AND TRADESMEN'S WIVES WERE LEAVING THE CITY THERE WILL BE LESS PANIC AND LESS GOSSIP RAN THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0002 THAT THE FRENCH WOULD ENTER MOSCOW THE SECOND BROADSHEET STATED THAT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE AT VYAZMA THAT COUNT WITTGENSTEIN HAD DEFEATED THE FRENCH BUT THAT AS MANY OF THE INHABITANTS OF MOSCOW WISHED TO BE ARMED WEAPONS WERE READY FOR THEM AT THE ARSENAL
3214-167606-0004 IF THIS PATIENCE COMES OUT HE SAID TO HIMSELF AFTER SHUFFLING THE CARDS HOLDING THEM IN HIS HAND AND LIFTING HIS HEAD IF IT COMES OUT IT MEANS WHAT DOES IT MEAN HE HAD NOT DECIDED WHAT IT SHOULD MEAN WHEN HE HEARD THE VOICE OF THE ELDEST PRINCESS
3214-167606-0005 AT THE DOOR ASKING WHETHER SHE MIGHT COME IN THEN IT WILL MEAN THAT I MUST GO TO THE ARMY SAID PIERRE TO HIMSELF COME IN COME IN HE ADDED TO THE PRINCESS ONLY THE ELDEST PRINCESS THE ONE WITH THE STONY FACE AND LONG WAIST WAS STILL LIVING IN PIERRE'S HOUSE
3214-167606-0007 SATISFACTORY INDEED VERY SATISFACTORY BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME TODAY HOW OUR TROOPS ARE DISTINGUISHING THEMSELVES IT CERTAINLY DOES THEM CREDIT AND THE PEOPLE TOO ARE QUITE MUTINOUS
3214-167606-0008 THEY NO LONGER OBEY EVEN MY MAID HAS TAKEN TO BEING RUDE AT THIS RATE THEY WILL SOON BEGIN BEATING US ONE CAN'T WALK IN THE STREETS BUT ABOVE ALL THE FRENCH WILL BE HERE ANY DAY NOW SO WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR I ASK JUST ONE THING OF YOU COUSIN SHE WENT ON
3214-167606-0010 I WON'T SUBMIT TO YOUR NAPOLEON OTHERS MAY IF THEY PLEASE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS BUT I WILL I'LL GIVE THE ORDER AT ONCE THE PRINCESS WAS APPARENTLY VEXED AT NOT HAVING ANYONE TO BE ANGRY WITH MUTTERING TO HERSELF SHE SAT DOWN ON A CHAIR
3214-167606-0011 BUT YOU HAVE BEEN MISINFORMED SAID PIERRE EVERYTHING IS QUIET IN THE CITY AND THERE IS NOT THE SLIGHTEST DANGER SEE I'VE JUST BEEN READING HE SHOWED HER THE BROADSHEET
3214-167606-0013 AND HONOR AND GLORY TO WHOEVER CAPTURES HIM HE SAYS THIS IS WHAT HIS CAJOLERY HAS BROUGHT US TO BARBARA IVANOVNA TOLD ME THE MOB NEAR KILLED HER BECAUSE SHE SAID SOMETHING IN FRENCH OH BUT IT'S SO YOU
3214-167606-0014 TAKE EVERYTHING SO TO HEART SAID PIERRE AND BEGAN LAYING OUT HIS CARDS FOR PATIENCE ALTHOUGH THAT PATIENCE DID COME OUT PIERRE DID NOT JOIN THE ARMY BUT REMAINED IN DESERTED MOSCOW EVER IN THE SAME STATE OF AGITATION
3214-167606-0016 COULD NOT BE FOUND WITHOUT SELLING ONE OF THE ESTATES IN GENERAL THE HEAD STEWARD MADE OUT TO PIERRE THAT HIS PROJECT OF RAISING A REGIMENT WOULD RUIN HIM PIERRE LISTENED TO HIM SCARCELY ABLE TO REPRESS A SMILE
3214-167606-0017 WELL THEN SELL IT SAID HE WHAT'S TO BE DONE I CAN'T DRAW BACK NOW THE WORSE EVERYTHING BECAME ESPECIALLY HIS OWN AFFAIRS THE BETTER WAS PIERRE PLEASED AND THE MORE EVIDENT WAS IT THAT THE CATASTROPHE HE EXPECTED WAS APPROACHING
3214-167606-0019 VORONTSOVO TO SEE THE GREAT BALLOON LEPPICH WAS CONSTRUCTING TO DESTROY THE FOE AND A TRIAL BALLOON THAT WAS TO GO UP NEXT DAY THE BALLOON WAS NOT YET READY BUT PIERRE LEARNED THAT IT WAS BEING CONSTRUCTED BY THE EMPEROR'S DESIRE
3214-167606-0020 GET TOGETHER A CREW OF RELIABLE AND INTELLIGENT MEN FOR HIS CAR AND SEND A COURIER TO GENERAL KUTUZOV TO LET HIM KNOW I HAVE INFORMED HIM OF THE MATTER PLEASE IMPRESS UPON LEPPICH TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHERE HE DESCENDS FOR THE FIRST TIME
3214-167606-0022 STOPPED AND GOT OUT OF HIS TRAP A FRENCH COOK ACCUSED OF BEING A SPY WAS BEING FLOGGED THE FLOGGING WAS ONLY JUST OVER AND THE EXECUTIONER WAS RELEASING FROM THE FLOGGING BENCH A STOUT MAN WITH RED WHISKERS IN BLUE STOCKINGS AND A GREEN JACKET
3214-167606-0023 WHO WAS MOANING PITEOUSLY ANOTHER CRIMINAL THIN AND PALE STOOD NEAR JUDGING BY THEIR FACES THEY WERE BOTH FRENCHMEN WITH A FRIGHTENED AND SUFFERING LOOK RESEMBLING THAT ON THE THIN FRENCHMAN'S FACE PIERRE PUSHED HIS WAY IN THROUGH THE CROWD
3214-167606-0025 THAT NO ONE ANSWERED HIM THE STOUT MAN ROSE FROWNED SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND EVIDENTLY TRYING TO APPEAR FIRM BEGAN TO PULL ON HIS JACKET WITHOUT LOOKING ABOUT HIM BUT SUDDENLY HIS LIPS TREMBLED AND HE BEGAN TO CRY
3214-167606-0026 RUSSIAN SAUCE SEEMS TO BE SOUR TO A FRENCHMAN SETS HIS TEETH ON EDGE SAID A WRINKLED CLERK WHO WAS STANDING BEHIND PIERRE WHEN THE FRENCHMAN BEGAN TO CRY THE CLERK GLANCED ROUND EVIDENTLY HOPING THAT HIS JOKE WOULD BE APPRECIATED
3214-167606-0028 AS THEY DROVE ALONG HE SHUDDERED AND EXCLAIMED SEVERAL TIMES SO AUDIBLY THAT THE COACHMAN ASKED HIM WHAT IS YOUR PLEASURE WHERE ARE YOU GOING SHOUTED PIERRE TO THE MAN WHO WAS DRIVING TO LUBYANKA STREET
3214-167606-0029 AT THE SIGHT OF THE TORTURED FRENCHMAN AND THE CROWD SURROUNDING THE LOBNOE PLACE PIERRE HAD SO DEFINITELY MADE UP HIS MIND THAT HE COULD NO LONGER REMAIN IN MOSCOW AND WOULD LEAVE FOR THE ARMY THAT VERY DAY THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT EITHER
3214-167606-0031 AND THAT HIS SADDLE HORSES SHOULD BE SENT THERE THIS COULD NOT ALL BE ARRANGED THAT DAY SO ON
3214-167606-0032 THIS WAS THE BATTLE OF SHEVARDINO HE WAS TOLD THAT THERE IN PERKHUSHKOVO THE EARTH TREMBLED FROM THE FIRING BUT NOBODY COULD ANSWER HIS QUESTIONS AS TO WHO HAD WON AT DAWN NEXT DAY PIERRE WAS APPROACHING MOZHAYSK
3214-167606-0034 EVERYWHERE IN MOZHAYSK AND BEYOND IT TROOPS WERE STATIONED OR ON THE MARCH COSSACKS FOOT AND HORSE SOLDIERS WAGONS CAISSONS AND CANNON WERE EVERYWHERE
3214-167606-0035 PIERRE PUSHED FORWARD AS FAST AS HE COULD AND THE FARTHER HE LEFT MOSCOW BEHIND AND THE DEEPER HE PLUNGED INTO THAT SEA OF TROOPS THE MORE WAS HE OVERCOME BY RESTLESS AGITATION AND A NEW AND JOYFUL FEELING HE HAD NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE
3214-167607-0000 WHY AND HOW WERE THE BATTLES OF SHEVARDINO AND BORODINO GIVEN AND ACCEPTED WHY WAS THE BATTLE OF BORODINO FOUGHT THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SENSE IN IT FOR EITHER THE FRENCH OR THE RUSSIANS ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT FOR THE RUSSIANS WAS AND WAS BOUND TO BE
3214-167607-0001 THAT WE WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF MOSCOW WHICH WE FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD AND FOR THE FRENCH ITS IMMEDIATE RESULT WAS THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT NEARER TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR WHOLE ARMY WHICH THEY FEARED MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD
3214-167607-0003 THAT BY ADVANCING THIRTEEN HUNDRED MILES AND GIVING BATTLE WITH A PROBABILITY OF LOSING A QUARTER OF HIS ARMY HE WAS ADVANCING TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN EQUALLY CLEAR TO KUTUZOV THAT BY ACCEPTING BATTLE
3214-167607-0004 AND GO ON EXCHANGING I SHALL CERTAINLY LOSE AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT EXCHANGE WHEN MY OPPONENT HAS SIXTEEN MEN AND I HAVE FOURTEEN I AM ONLY ONE EIGHTH WEAKER THAN HE BUT WHEN I HAVE EXCHANGED THIRTEEN MORE MEN
3214-167607-0006 WE HAD A HUNDRED THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND AFTERWARDS LITTLE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AGAINST A HUNDRED THOUSAND YET THE SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED KUTUZOV ACCEPTED THE BATTLE WHILE NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0007 AS HE HAD ENDED A PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN BY OCCUPYING VIENNA THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NAPOLEON'S HISTORIANS THEMSELVES TELL US THAT FROM SMOLENSK ONWARDS HE WISHED TO STOP
3214-167607-0009 THE HISTORIANS PROVIDED CUNNINGLY DEVISED EVIDENCE
3214-167607-0010 OF ALL THE BLIND TOOLS OF HISTORY WERE THE MOST ENSLAVED AND INVOLUNTARY THE ANCIENTS HAVE LEFT US MODEL HEROIC POEMS IN WHICH THE HEROES FURNISH THE WHOLE INTEREST OF THE STORY
3214-167607-0012 THERE ALSO EXISTS A DEFINITE AND WELL KNOWN BUT QUITE FALSE CONCEPTION ALL THE HISTORIANS DESCRIBE THE AFFAIR AS FOLLOWS THE RUSSIAN ARMY THEY SAY IN ITS RETREAT FROM SMOLENSK SOUGHT OUT FOR ITSELF THE BEST POSITION FOR A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT
3214-167607-0013 AT THE VERY PLACE WHERE THE BATTLE WAS FOUGHT IN FRONT OF THIS POSITION THEY SAY A FORTIFIED OUTPOST WAS SET UP ON THE SHEVARDINO MOUND TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH WE ARE TOLD NAPOLEON ATTACKED THIS ADVANCED POST AND TOOK IT
3214-167607-0015 THE RUSSIANS DID NOT SEEK OUT THE BEST POSITION BUT ON THE CONTRARY DURING THE RETREAT PASSED MANY POSITIONS BETTER THAN BORODINO THEY DID NOT STOP AT ANY ONE OF THESE POSITIONS BECAUSE KUTUZOV DID NOT WISH TO OCCUPY A POSITION
3214-167607-0016 HE HAD NOT HIMSELF CHOSEN BECAUSE THE POPULAR DEMAND FOR A BATTLE HAD NOT YET EXPRESSED ITSELF STRONGLY ENOUGH AND BECAUSE MILORADOVICH HAD NOT YET ARRIVED WITH THE MILITIA AND FOR MANY OTHER REASONS
3214-167607-0018 BY STICKING A PIN INTO THE MAP AT HAZARD NOT ONLY DID THE RUSSIANS NOT FORTIFY THE POSITION ON THE FIELD OF BORODINO TO THE LEFT OF AND AT A RIGHT ANGLE TO THE HIGHROAD
3214-167607-0019 THAT IS THE POSITION ON WHICH THE BATTLE TOOK PLACE BUT NEVER TILL THE TWENTY FIFTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN TWELVE DID THEY THINK THAT A BATTLE MIGHT BE FOUGHT THERE THIS WAS SHOWN FIRST BY THE FACT THAT THERE WERE NO ENTRENCHMENTS THERE BY THE TWENTY FIFTH
3214-167607-0021 STRONGLY FORTIFIED THAN ANY OTHER POST AND WHY WERE ALL EFFORTS EXHAUSTED AND SIX THOUSAND MEN SACRIFICED TO DEFEND IT TILL LATE AT NIGHT ON THE TWENTY FOURTH A COSSACK PATROL WOULD HAVE SUFFICED TO OBSERVE THE ENEMY THIRDLY
3214-167607-0022 THAT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT WAS AN ADVANCED POST WHEREAS IN REALITY IT WAS SIMPLY A FORTIFIED POINT ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THAT THE BATTLE OF BORODINO WAS FOUGHT BY US ON AN ENTRENCHED POSITION PREVIOUSLY SELECTED WHERE
3214-167607-0024 AND THE CENTER AT BORODINO AT THE CONFLUENCE OF THE RIVERS KOLOCHA AND VOYNA TO ANYONE WHO LOOKS AT THE FIELD OF BORODINO WITHOUT THINKING OF HOW THE BATTLE WAS ACTUALLY FOUGHT THIS POSITION
3214-167607-0025 PROTECTED BY THE RIVER KOLOCHA PRESENTS ITSELF AS OBVIOUS FOR AN ARMY WHOSE OBJECT WAS TO PREVENT AN ENEMY FROM ADVANCING ALONG THE SMOLENSK ROAD TO MOSCOW NAPOLEON
3214-167607-0027 BUT WHILE PURSUING THE RUSSIAN REARGUARD HE CAME UPON THE LEFT FLANK OF THE RUSSIAN POSITION AT THE SHEVARDINO REDOUBT AND UNEXPECTEDLY FOR THE RUSSIANS MOVED HIS ARMY ACROSS THE KOLOCHA
3214-167607-0028 AND THE RUSSIANS NOT HAVING TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT WITHDREW THEIR LEFT WING FROM THE POSITION THEY HAD INTENDED TO OCCUPY AND TOOK UP A NEW POSITION WHICH HAD NOT BEEN FORESEEN AND WAS NOT FORTIFIED
3214-167607-0030 SEMENOVSK AND BORODINO A PLAIN NO MORE ADVANTAGEOUS AS A POSITION THAN ANY OTHER PLAIN IN RUSSIA AND THERE THE WHOLE BATTLE OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF AUGUST TOOK PLACE
3214-167607-0031 HAD NAPOLEON NOT RIDDEN OUT ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH TO THE KOLOCHA AND HAD HE NOT THEN ORDERED AN IMMEDIATE ATTACK ON THE REDOUBT BUT HAD BEGUN THE ATTACK NEXT MORNING
3214-167607-0033 AND THE ENGAGEMENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE ON THE TWENTY FIFTH IN THE POSITION WE INTENDED AND HAD FORTIFIED BUT AS THE ATTACK ON OUR LEFT FLANK TOOK PLACE IN THE EVENING AFTER THE RETREAT OF OUR REAR GUARD THAT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIGHT
3214-167607-0034 AT GRIDNEVA AND AS THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS DID NOT WISH OR WERE NOT IN TIME TO BEGIN A GENERAL ENGAGEMENT THEN ON THE EVENING OF THE TWENTY FOURTH THE FIRST AND CHIEF ACTION OF THE BATTLE OF BORODINO
3214-167607-0036 NOT ONLY WAS THE RUSSIAN ARMY ON THE TWENTY SIXTH DEFENDED BY WEAK UNFINISHED ENTRENCHMENTS BUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF THAT POSITION WAS INCREASED BY THE FACT THAT THE RUSSIAN COMMANDERS
3214-167607-0037 NAMELY THE LOSS OF OUR POSITION ON THE LEFT FLANK AND THE SHIFTING OF THE WHOLE FIELD OF THE FORTHCOMING BATTLE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT
3214-167607-0039 PONIATOWSKI'S ACTION AGAINST UTITSA AND UVAROV'S ON THE RIGHT FLANK AGAINST THE FRENCH WERE ACTIONS DISTINCT FROM THE MAIN COURSE OF THE BATTLE SO THE BATTLE OF BORODINO DID NOT TAKE PLACE AT ALL AS
3214-167607-0040 IN AN EFFORT TO CONCEAL OUR COMMANDERS MISTAKES EVEN AT THE COST OF DIMINISHING THE GLORY DUE TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND PEOPLE IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED
3235-11599-0001 AS E G AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MOVEMENT BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE EAR A SINGLE ISOLATED MEASURE IS NOT POSSIBLE AND THE TERM MUST THEREFORE BE DEFINED IN THE PLURAL FORM
3235-11599-0002 MEASURES ARE SIMILARLY ACCENTED GROUPS OF EVENLY SPACED BEATS EACH GROUP HAVING AT LEAST ONE ACCENTED AND ONE NON ACCENTED BEAT THE STRONGEST ACCENT FALLS NORMALLY ON THE FIRST BEAT IN THE MEASURE
3235-11599-0004 ONE OR MORE OF THESE BEATS BEING STRONGER THAN THE REST TWO CERTAIN RHYTHMIC FIGURES
3235-11599-0005 CETERA WHICH FORM THE ACTUAL MUSICAL CONTENT OF THESE GROUPS THE STUDENT WILL NOTE THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RHYTHM AND MEASURE RHYTHM IS THE REGULAR RECURRENCE OF ACCENT IN A SERIES OF BEATS OR PULSES
3235-11599-0007 BUT A MAY SUBJECTIVELY GROUP THE BEATS INTO ONE TWO ONE TWO ET CETERA WHILE B FEELS THE GROUPS AS ONE TWO THREE FOUR ONE TWO THREE FOUR ET CETERA
3235-11599-0008 RHYTHM IS THUS SEEN TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL THING INHERENT IN THE MUSIC ITSELF WHILE MEASURE IS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AT LEAST AN ARBITRARY GROUPING WHICH MUSICIANS HAVE ADOPTED FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES NINETY EIGHT
3235-11599-0010 AND COMPOUND A SIMPLE MEASURE IS ONE WHICH HAS BUT A SINGLE ACCENT
3235-11599-0011 TWO BEAT MEASURE AND THREE BEAT MEASURE A COMPOUND MEASURE IS AS ITS NAME IMPLIES ONE MADE UP BY COMBINING TWO OR MORE SIMPLE MEASURES OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE IN SLOW TEMPO
3235-11599-0013 ARE ALSO CLASSIFIED AS COMPOUND MEASURES AN ENGLISH WRITER
3235-11599-0014 CLASSIFIES MEASURES AS DUPLE TRIPLE OR QUADRUPLE SPECIFYING THAT A SIMPLE MEASURE IS ONE IN WHICH EACH BEAT IS REPRESENTED BY A NOTE WHOSE VALUE CAN BE DIVIDED INTO HALVES
3235-11599-0016 THERE IS THUS SEEN TO BE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AS TO THE MEANING OF THE WORDS SIMPLE AND COMPOUND WHEN APPLIED IN THIS CONNECTION THE PRINCIPAL QUESTION AT ISSUE BEING WHETHER FOUR BEAT MEASURE IS AN INDIVIDUAL VARIETY
3235-11599-0017 OR WHETHER IT IS A VARIETY COMPOUNDED OUT OF TWO BEAT MEASURES EITHER BY PLACING TWO OF THESE IN A GROUP OR BY THE ELABORATION OF A SINGLE MEASURE INTO A LARGER NUMBER OF BEATS AS IS OFTEN NECESSARY IN SLOW TEMPI
3235-11599-0019 IN WHICH THERE ARE THREE BEATS THE FIRST ONE BEING ACCENTED THE SECOND AND THIRD UNACCENTED
3235-11599-0020 THREE EIGHTH THREE QUARTER AND THREE HALF MEASURE RESPECTIVELY THREE QUADRUPLE IN WHICH THERE ARE FOUR BEATS THE FIRST AND THIRD BEING ACCENTED PRIMARY ACCENT ON ONE SECONDARY ACCENT ON THREE
3235-11599-0022 FOUR SEXTUPLE IN WHICH THERE ARE SIX BEATS THE FIRST AND FOURTH BEING ACCENTED THE OTHERS NOT IN RAPID TEMPI THIS IS ALWAYS TAKEN AS COMPOUND DUPLE MEASURE A DOTTED QUARTER NOTE HAVING A BEAT
3235-11599-0023 IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE TWO MEASURES
3235-11599-0025 QUINTUPLE FIVE BEAT AND SEPTUPLE SEVEN BEAT MEASURES ARE OCCASIONALLY MET WITH BUT THESE ARE RARE AND WILL ALWAYS BE SPORADIC THE FIVE BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN AS A COMBINATION OF THREE AND TWO
3235-11599-0026 OR OF TWO AND THREE SOMETIMES A MIXTURE OF BOTH IN THE SAME COMPOSITION WHILE THE SEVEN BEAT MEASURE IS TAKEN IN GROUPS OF FOUR AND THREE OR OF THREE AND FOUR
3235-11599-0028 BUT AN INCOMPLETE CIRCLE DIFFERENTIATING TWO BEAT IMPERFECT MEASURE FROM THREE BEAT PERFECT MEASURE
3235-28433-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN GOING TO NOME ONE BEAUTIFUL DAY IN THE SPRING OF NINETEEN HUNDRED I SAILED AGAIN FOR ALASKA THIS TIME FOR NOME FROM SAN FRANCISCO
3235-28433-0002 TENTS AND BEDDING SUFFICIENT TO LAST UNTIL SOME OF OUR NUMEROUS PLANS OF WORK AFTER OUR ARRIVAL BROUGHT IN RETURNS MY HOPE WAS TO MEET MY FATHER THERE FOR HE HAD WRITTEN THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD GO TO THE NEW GOLD FIELDS
3235-28433-0003 WHERE HE COULD DO BEACH MINING I WAS NOT ABOVE DOING ANY HONEST WORK AND FELT CONFIDENT THAT I COULD MAKE MY WAY IF I COULD GAIN AN ENTRANCE INTO THAT COUNTRY THE ENGLISH PEOPLE WERE ALL WORKERS AND I HAD KNOWN THEM FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE
3235-28433-0005 WHEN I LAUGHINGLY CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ONE OF THE OWNERS OF THE SHIP TO THE FACT THAT THAT DATE FELL UPON FRIDAY AND MANY PERSONS OBJECTED TO SAILING UPON THAT DAY HE POSTPONED THE STARTING OF THE SAINT PAUL TO MAY TWENTY SIXTH
3235-28433-0006 AND WE LEFT THE DOCK ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AMID THE CHEERS AND HAND WAVING OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD COME TO SEE THE BIG BOAT OFF FOR NOME THE STEAMER WAS WELL FITTED OUT SPICK AND SPAN IN FRESH CARPETS AND PAINT
3235-28433-0008 AND THE SHIP WAS WELL MANNED I WAS NOW MUCH GRATIFIED TO LEARN THAT THERE WERE MANY ON BOARD WHOM I HAD MET BEFORE THAT THE STEWARD STEWARDESS AND SEVERAL OF THE WAITERS HAD BEEN ON DUTY ON THE STEAMER BERTHA
3235-28433-0009 DURING MY TRIP OUT FROM ALASKA THE FALL BEFORE WHILE I WAS UPON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A DOZEN OR MORE OF THE PASSENGERS WITH WHOM I HAD TRAVELED FROM THE SAME PLACE OF PASSENGERS WE HAD ALL TOLD
3235-28433-0011 WHOM I HAD SEEN AT SAINT MICHAEL SOME MONTHS BEFORE AND WHO WAS NOW GOING BACK TO HER NORTHERN HOME SHE WORE A SAILOR SUIT OF NAVY BLUE SERGE TRIMMED WITH WHITE BRAID AND WAS AS COY AND CUNNING AS EVER
3235-28433-0012 NOT SPEAKING OFTEN TO STRANGERS BUT LAUGHING AND RUNNING AWAY TO HER MOTHER WHEN ADDRESSED FROM THE DAY WE SAILED FROM SAN FRANCISCO UNTIL WE REACHED NOME I MISSED NO MEALS IN THE DINING SALON
3235-28433-0014 DURING THE NINE DAYS SAIL FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO UNALASKA A DISTANCE OF TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILES I STUDIED WELL THE PASSENGERS WE HAD PREACHERS ON BOARD
3235-28433-0015 AS WELL AS DOCTORS LAWYERS MERCHANTS AND MINERS AND THERE WERE WOMEN GOING TO NOME TO START EATING HOUSES HOTELS AND MERCANTILE SHOPS THERE WERE SEVERAL SWEDISH MISSIONARIES
3235-28433-0017 AND OCCUPYING THE NEXT STATEROOM TO MINE THE LAST NAMED WERE GOING TO START A RESTAURANT IN NOME AS THEY WERE SOCIABLE JOLLY AND GOOD SAILORS FOR THE MOST PART I ENJOYED THEIR SOCIETY THEY HAD ALL LIVED IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR YEARS
3235-28433-0018 AND THOUGH NOT RELATED TO EACH OTHER WERE FIRM FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING AND WERE UNITING THEIR LITTLE FORTUNES IN THE HOPE OF MAKING GREATER ONES THE YOUNG MISSIONARY WAS A FRIEND TO THE OTHER THREE
3235-28433-0020 LITTLE DID I THEN THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE PLACED BY A SEEMING CHANCE IN AN ADJOINING STATEROOM WERE TO BE MY FELLOW WORKERS AND TRUE FRIENDS NOT ONLY FOR THE COMING MONTHS IN THAT ARCTIC LAND TO WHICH WE WERE GOING BUT
3235-28433-0021 AS THE SEQUEL WILL SHOW PERHAPS FOR YEARS TO COME NOT MANY DAYS HAD PASSED WHEN WE FOUND THAT WE HAD ON BOARD WHAT FEW STEAMERS CAN BOAST OF AND THAT WAS AN ORCHESTRA OF PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS AMONG THE WAITERS
3235-28433-0023 WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL SINGERS ON BOARD GAVE CONCERTS IN THE DINING SALON WHICH THOUGH IMPROMPTU WERE VERY ENJOYABLE A SWEET AND TRAINED SINGER WAS THE ENGLISH GIRL OF OUR COMPANY
3235-28433-0024 AND SHE SANG MANY TIMES ACCOMPANIED BY THE STRINGED INSTRUMENTS OF THE MUSICIANS MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE ASSEMBLED PASSENGERS WHEN SHE SANG ONE EVENING IN HER CLEAR SYMPATHETIC VOICE THE SELECTION
3235-28433-0026 MAKING HIM RESOLVE TO WRITE OFTENER TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT BE COMFORTED WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HIS WHEREABOUTS AND WELFARE THESE EVENINGS WERE SOMETIMES VARIED BY RECITATIONS FROM AN ELOCUTIONIST ON BOARD
3235-28433-0027 AND A PRACTISED CLOG DANCER EXCITED THE RISIBLES OF THE COMPANY TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY USUALLY SHOUTED WITH LAUGHTER AT HIS EXHIBITION OF FLYING HEELS DAY AFTER DAY PASSED
3235-28433-0029 AND IT WAS EQUALLY USELESS TO RECOMMEND AN ANTIDOTE FOR MAL DE MER SUCH AS THEIRS NO ONE WAS EVER SO ILL BEFORE THEY SAID THEY KNEW THEY SHOULD DIE AND BE BURIED AT SEA
3235-28433-0030 AND HOPED THEY WOULD IF THAT WOULD PUT AN END TO THEIR SUFFERINGS WE TRIED AT LAST TO GIVE THEM COMFORT BY RECOMMENDING OUT OF FORMER EXPERIENCES SHIP'S BISCUIT DRY TOAST AND POP CORN AS REMEDIES
3235-28433-0032 THESE FAVORITE AND MUCH USED LIQUIDS KEEPING UP A CONTINUAL SWISHING IN ONE'S INTERIOR REGIONS AND CAUSING ONE TO TRUTHFULLY SPEAK OF THE SAME AS INFERNAL INSTEAD OF INTERNAL
3235-28433-0033 BUT THEY WERE ALL TREE PHYSICAL AS WELL AS FREE MORAL AGENTS AND DECIDED THESE THINGS FOR THEMSELVES AT LAST WE ENTERED THE JAPAN CURRENT AND THE WEATHER WAS WARMER AND MORE ENJOYABLE
3235-28433-0035 WE WERE NOT MISTAKEN AFTER EATING AN EXCELLENT SIX O'CLOCK DINNER WE WENT ABOVE TO FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN HIGH ROCKY CLIFFS WHICH LOOMED UP INTO MOUNTAINS NOT FAR DISTANT
3235-28433-0036 AND WE KNEW WE WERE AGAIN AT THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS AND IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF UNIMAK PASS AS WE DREW NEARER AND ENTERED THE HARBOR SO WELL LAND LOCKED THE SUN DIPPED LOW INTO YELLOW RED WESTERN WATERS
3235-28433-0038 AND HERE NUMBERS OF SHIPS LAY ANCHORED AT REST PASSING ALONG EASILY BEYOND ANOTHER HIGH MOUNTAIN WE WERE SOON AT THE DOCK OF UNALASKA BESIDE OTHER GREAT SHIPS IN PORT
3235-28433-0039 BOTH GROUPS OF CRAFT WERE EVIDENTLY WAITING FOR THE ICE TO CLEAR FROM BEHRING SEA BEFORE PROCEEDING ON THEIR WAY NORTHWARD AND WE COUNTED SIXTEEN SHIPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND SIZES THE MAJORITY OF THEM LARGE STEAMERS
3235-28433-0041 AND THE RETURN OF THESE SCOUTS WITH GOOD NEWS WAS ANXIOUSLY WATCHED AND WAITED FOR AS THE MOST DESIRED THING AT THAT TIME WAS A SPEEDY AND SAFE LANDING ON THE SUPPOSEDLY GOLDEN BEACH SANDS OF NOME
3235-28433-0042 AT UNALASKA WE SPENT FOUR DAYS TAKING ON FRESH WATER AND COAL DURING WHICH TIME PASSENGERS VISITED BACK AND FORTH FROM THE WAITING STEAMERS MANY PERSONS HAVING FRIENDS ON OTHER BOATS
3235-28433-0044 WHICH WAS ONE OF THE COMMONEST SLANG PHRASES INTENDED TO MEAN THAT THEY HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH THE ALASKA COMMERCIAL COMPANY AND THEIR STEAMER SAINT PAUL ALL WERE WELL CARED FOR AND SATISFIED AS WELL THEY MIGHT BE
3235-28433-0045 WITH THE SERVICE OF THE SHIP'S MEN LEAVING UNALASKA THE SUN SHONE CLEAR AND COLD UPON THE MOUNTAINS WHERE IN PLACES THE SIDES LOOKED BLACK FROM THE LATE FIRES STARTED IN THE DEEP TUNDRA BY MISCREANTS
3235-28433-0047 NO TREE NOR SHRUB OBSTRUCTED THE WAY WITH GNARLED OLD TRUNKS TWISTED ROOTS OR LOW HANGING BRANCHES FOR NONE GROW IN UNALASKA
3235-28433-0048 AND THE BOLD DIGNITY AND GRANDEUR OF THE MOUNTAINS IS NEVER DIMINISHED BY THESE LESSER OBJECTS AS OUR SHIP SAILED OUT INTO BEHRING SEA WE WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY THE STEAMER GEORGE W ELDER WHOSE MASTER
3235-28452-0000 ON THE MORNING OF THE TWENTY SIXTH OF JUNE I AWOKE TO FIND THAT THE ICE HAD DRIFTED OUT TO SEA IN THE NIGHT EIGHT DAYS AFTER MOLLIE AND I HAD TAKEN OUR TWELVE MILES TRIP ACROSS THE BAY AND RETURN
3235-28452-0001 THEN CAME HARD RAIN AND WIND THAT FOR SEVERAL DAYS BLEW THE ICE BACK INTO THE BAY FIRST TO ONE SIDE AND THEN TO THE OTHER SO THAT THE STEAMERS WAITING TO COME IN COULD NOT DO SO FOR FEAR OF THE DRIFTING FLOES
3235-28452-0003 WITH NEWSPAPERS AND TIDINGS OF FRIENDS IN THE STATES THEN OUR FINGERS TREMBLED AT OPENING OUR LETTERS UNTIL WE FOUND THAT ALL OUR DEAR ONES WERE WELL AND WE HEARTILY THANKED THE LORD
3235-28452-0004 THERE WERE OTHER WHITE WOMEN IN CAMP BY THIS TIME AND MANY STRANGERS AT THE HOTEL AMONG OTHERS OFFICIALS AND THOSE IN AUTHORITY SINCE THE STONE THROWING EPISODE THE MARSHAL HAD BEEN DOING DUTY AS WATCHMAN
3235-28452-0006 OUR LITTLE SICK GIRL BEING OBLIGED NOW TO KEEP HER BED CONTINUALLY WITH NO MORE PLAYING IN THE SAND AND SUNSHINE ALTHOUGH HER COUGH HAD LEFT HER WAS STILL THE SAME SWEET PATIENT CHILD SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH ALL HER ILLNESS
3235-28452-0007 AND MY WHOLE TIME WAS GIVEN TO HER BEFORE ONE OF THE SUNNY SOUTH WINDOWS OF THE LIVING ROOM WE PLACED HER COT EACH MORNING AND HERE SHE RECEIVED HER NUMEROUS FRIENDS BOTH ESKIMO AND WHITE AND THEIR NAMES WERE LEGION
3235-28452-0009 OR WILD FOWL FOR HER SUPPER SOMETIMES IT WAS CANDY NUTS OR FRESH FRUIT FROM NOME AND WITH EVERYTHING SHE WAS WELL PLEASED AND JOYOUS FRIENDS SOON CAME IN FROM THE OUTSIDE BRINGING CITY DOLLS DRESSED IN RIBBONS AND LACES
3235-28452-0010 THERE WERE TINY DISHES CHAIRS TABLES A HUNDRED THINGS DEAR TO A LITTLE GIRL'S HEART AND ALL PLEASED HER IMMENSELY BUT ALL WERE LAID QUICKLY ASIDE FOR A BASKET OF WILD FLOWERS OR MOSSES
3235-28452-0012 AND YOUNG AS SHE IS AND HAVING SEEN THE GREAT CITY BY THE GOLDEN GATE WITH MANY OF ITS WONDERS SHE IS HAPPIEST IN CHINIK HERE LIVES HER DEAR OLD GRANDMOTHER HER COUSINS AND AUNTS
3235-28452-0013 FOR WHICH SHE HAS A WHOLE HEARTFUL OF LOVE AND THE SIGHT OF WHICH IS BETTER TO HER THAN MEDICINE DURING THE MONTH OF JULY WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE INCOMING STEAMERS AND WELCOMED ALL NEW COMERS WHO LANDED IN CHINIK
3235-28452-0015 A FEW REMAINED FOR THE SUMMER HERE MEN BUILT BOATS AND ROWED AWAY TO KEECHAWIK AND NEUKLUK CARRYING SUPPLIES FOR HUNTING OR PROSPECTING THE CAPTAIN'S VEGETABLE GARDEN IN THE SAND WAS GROWING RAPIDLY
3235-28452-0016 AND WAS WATCHED WITH EAGER EYES BY EVERYONE WE ATE LETTUCE AND RADISHES PICKED FRESH FROM THE GARDEN BEDS WHERE THEY HAD BEEN SOWN BY THE CAPTAIN'S OWN HANDS AND WE FOUND AGEETUK AND MOLLIE TO BE QUITE FAMOUS COOKS
3235-28452-0018 FRESH MEATS AND VEGETABLES WE MADE UP FOR MANY MONTHS OF WINTER DIETING ALL THIS TIME I LONGED TO GET AWAY I WAS GOING EACH DAY TO THE HILL TOP TO WATCH FOR THE STEAMERS WHICH WOULD BRING THE LETTERS FOR WHICH I WAITED
3235-28452-0019 AFFAIRS CONNECTED WITH MY GOLD CLAIMS WERE WITH
3235-28452-0021 I WAS DETERMINED TO GO TO SAINT MICHAEL UP THE YUKON TO DAWSON AND OUTSIDE AND LAID MY PLANS ACCORDINGLY
3235-28452-0022 THE LATTER NOW GROWN WILFUL BUT STILL SO BRIGHT AND PRETTY I WANTED TO TAKE BOTH WITH ME BUT NO I COULD NOT THE LITTLE GIRL'S WORK WAS NOT ENDED
3235-28452-0024 AND SHE LIKE AN OASIS IN A DESERT PLACE IS LEFT HERE TO CHEER LOVE AND HELP OTHERS MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE OF THE SWEET AND GENTLE INFLUENCES GOING OUT FROM THE LIFE OF LITTLE YAHKUK
3235-28452-0025 AS SHE LIES UPON HER COT OF PAIN A TALL BROWN MINER ENTERS THE LIVING ROOM GOES TO THE LITTLE BED BY THE WINDOW SPEAKS SOFTLY AND BENDING OVER THE TINY GIRL KISSES HER
3235-28452-0027 PRICKS ITS WAY STILL DEEPER AND SMALL ARMS GO UP AROUND HIS NECK WHEN THE MAN TURNS HIS FACE WEARS A SOFT AND TENDER EXPRESSION AS THOUGH HE WERE LOOKING AT SOME BEAUTIFUL SIGHT FAR AWAY
3235-28452-0028 AND PERHAPS HE IS GOD GRANT THAT THE SWEET MEMORY OF THAT LITTLE CHILD'S KISS MAY BE SO LASTING THAT ALL THEIR LIVES HE AND OTHERS MAY BE PURER AND BETTER MEN
3235-28452-0030 TO MY GOOD MISSIONARY FRIENDS I HAD ALREADY SAID GOOD BYE AND THE CAPTAIN AND MOLLIE WERE KINDLY REGRETFUL WITH TEARS IN MY EYES BUT WITH REAL PAIN IN MY HEART I BADE JENNIE GOOD BYE
3235-28452-0031 AND STEPPED INTO THE LITTLE BOAT WHICH WAS TO CARRY ME TO THE DORA FAREWELL THEN TO CHINIK THE HOME OF THE NORTH WIND AND BLIZZARD FAREWELL TO THE ICE FIELDS OF GOLOVIN
3235-28452-0033 FAREWELL TO MY WHITE FACED FRIENDS AND TO THE DARK SKINNED ONES
3240-131231-0000 ATTEMPTS TO PRESERVE THE SYSTEM THAT SMALL FROGS AND TOADS FOR INSTANCE NEVER HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY BUT WERE ON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE OR THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCH FALLS UP FROM ONE PLACE IN A WHIRLWIND AND DOWN IN ANOTHER
3240-131231-0002 I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT I AM PERMITTED TO SEE BECAUSE I AM STILL PRIMITIVE OR INTELLIGENT OR IN A STATE OF MALADJUSTMENT
3240-131231-0003 OF A FALL OF TADPOLES FROM THE SKY AS TO THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE
3240-131231-0005 THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM A GREAT THICK CLOUD THAT APPEARED SUDDENLY IN A SKY THAT HAD BEEN CLOUDLESS AUGUST EIGHTEEN O FOUR NEAR TOULOUSE FRANCE ACCORDING TO A LETTER FROM PROFESSOR PONTUS TO M ARAGO
3240-131231-0006 MANY INSTANCES OF FROGS THAT WERE SEEN TO FALL FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0008 JULY THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0009 LITTLE TOADS FOUND IN A DESERT AFTER A RAINFALL NOTES AND QUERIES
3240-131231-0011 IN THE LONDON TIMES JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF A SHOWER OF TWIGS AND LEAVES AND TINY TOADS IN A STORM UPON THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES THESE MAY HAVE BEEN THE EJECTAMENTA OF A WHIRLWIND I ADD HOWEVER
3240-131231-0012 THAT I HAVE NOTES UPON TWO OTHER FALLS OF TINY TOADS IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY THREE ONE IN FRANCE AND ONE IN TAHITI ALSO OF FISH IN SCOTLAND BUT IN THE PHENOMENON OF THE APENNINES THE MIXTURE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TYPICAL OF THE PRODUCTS OF A WHIRLWIND
3240-131231-0014 BUT A WHIRLWIND IS THOUGHT OF AS A CONDITION OF CHAOS QUASI CHAOS
3240-131231-0015 MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JULY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE A SMALL POND IN THE TRACK OF THE CLOUD WAS SUCKED DRY THE WATER BEING CARRIED OVER THE ADJOINING FIELDS TOGETHER WITH A LARGE QUANTITY OF SOFT MUD WHICH WAS SCATTERED OVER THE GROUND FOR HALF A MILE AROUND
3240-131231-0017 OF ALL INSTANCES I HAVE THAT ATTRIBUTE THE FALL OF SMALL FROGS OR TOADS TO WHIRLWINDS ONLY ONE DEFINITELY IDENTIFIES OR PLACES THE WHIRLWIND ALSO AS HAS BEEN SAID BEFORE A POND GOING UP WOULD BE QUITE AS INTERESTING AS FROGS COMING DOWN
3240-131231-0018 WHIRLWINDS WE READ OF OVER AND OVER BUT WHERE AND WHAT WHIRLWIND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANYBODY WHO HAD LOST A POND WOULD BE HEARD FROM IN SYMONS METEOROLOGICAL MAGAZINE
3240-131231-0020 AND SOMETHING THAT STRIKES MY ATTENTION HERE IS THAT THESE FROGS ARE DESCRIBED AS ALMOST WHITE I'M AFRAID THERE IS NO ESCAPE FOR US WE SHALL HAVE TO GIVE TO CIVILIZATION UPON THIS EARTH SOME NEW WORLDS PLACES WITH WHITE FROGS IN THEM
3240-131231-0021 IN SPITE OF ALL WE THINK WE KNOW OF THE ACCELERATIVE VELOCITY OF FALLING BODIES AND HAVE PROPAGATED WHY THE EXOTIC BECOMES THE INDIGENOUS OR FROM THE STRANGEST OF PLACES WE'D EXPECT THE FAMILIAR OR
3240-131231-0023 AFTER ONE OF THE GREATEST HURRICANES IN THE HISTORY OF IRELAND SOME FISH WERE FOUND AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE EDGE OF A LAKE HAVE ANOTHER THIS IS A GOOD ONE FOR THE EXCLUSIONISTS FALL OF FISH IN PARIS SAID THAT A NEIGHBORING POND HAD BEEN BLOWN DRY
3240-131231-0024 DATE NOT GIVEN BUT I HAVE SEEN IT RECORDED SOMEWHERE ELSE THE BEST KNOWN FALL OF FISHES FROM THE SKY IS THAT WHICH OCCURRED AT MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0026 HAVING PUBLISHED A REPORT OF A FALL OF FISHES WRITES I AM CONTINUALLY RECEIVING SIMILAR ACCOUNTS OF FROGS AND FISHES BUT IN ALL THE VOLUMES OF THE ZOOLOGIST I CAN FIND ONLY TWO REPORTS OF SUCH FALLS THERE IS NOTHING TO CONCLUDE
3240-131231-0027 OTHER THAN THAT HOSTS OF DATA HAVE BEEN LOST BECAUSE ORTHODOXY DOES NOT LOOK FAVORABLY UPON SUCH REPORTS THE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW RECORDS SEVERAL FALLS OF FISHES IN THE UNITED STATES
3240-131231-0029 VICAR OF ABEDARE ASSERTING THAT THE FALL HAD OCCURRED CHIEFLY UPON THE PROPERTY OF MISTER NIXON OF MOUNTAIN ASH
3240-131231-0030 OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM BRISTLING WITH EXCLUSIONISM WRITES THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM ALIVE WERE VERY YOUNG MINNOWS HE SAYS ON READING THE EVIDENCE IT SEEMS TO ME MOST PROBABLY ONLY A PRACTICAL JOKE
3240-131231-0032 HE PUBLISHES A LETTER FROM ANOTHER CORRESPONDENT WHO APOLOGIZES FOR OPPOSING SO HIGH AN AUTHORITY AS DOCTOR GRAY BUT SAYS THAT HE HAD OBTAINED SOME OF THESE FISHES FROM PERSONS WHO LIVED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE APART
3240-131231-0033 OR CONSIDERABLY OUT OF RANGE OF THE PLAYFUL PAIL OF WATER ACCORDING TO THE ANNUAL REGISTER
3240-131231-0035 THAT TEN MINUTES LATER ANOTHER FALL OF FISHES OCCURRED UPON THIS SAME NARROW STRIP OF LAND EVEN ARGUING THAT A WHIRLWIND MAY STAND STILL AXIALLY IT DISCHARGES TANGENTIALLY WHEREVER THE FISHES CAME FROM IT DOES NOT SEEM THINKABLE
3240-131231-0036 THAT SOME COULD HAVE FALLEN AND THAT OTHERS COULD HAVE WHIRLED EVEN A TENTH OF A MINUTE THEN FALLING DIRECTLY AFTER THE FIRST TO FALL BECAUSE OF THESE EVIL CIRCUMSTANCES THE BEST ADAPTATION WAS TO LAUGH THE WHOLE THING OFF
3240-131231-0038 BUT THERE IS SOME QUESTION OF SPECIES I THINK MYSELF THAT THEY WERE MINNOWS AND STICKLEBACKS SOME PERSONS THINKING THEM TO BE SEA FISHES PLACED THEM IN SALT WATER ACCORDING TO MISTER ROBERTS
3240-131231-0039 SOME WERE PLACED IN FRESH WATER THESE SEEMED TO THRIVE WELL AS TO NARROW DISTRIBUTION WE ARE TOLD THAT THE FISHES FELL IN AND ABOUT THE PREMISES OF MISTER NIXON IT WAS NOT OBSERVED AT THE TIME THAT ANY FISH FELL IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
3240-131231-0041 IN THIS LETTER IT IS SAID THAT THE LARGEST FISHES WERE FIVE INCHES LONG AND THAT THESE DID NOT SURVIVE THE FALL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ASSOCIATION
3240-131231-0042 THE EVIDENCE OF THE FALL OF FISH ON THIS OCCASION WAS VERY CONCLUSIVE A SPECIMEN OF THE FISH WAS EXHIBITED
3240-131231-0044 IN WHICH WERE THOUSANDS OF FISHES FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SOME OF WHICH COVERED ROOFS OF HOUSES AND SOME OF WHICH REMAINED TEN MINUTES IN THE AIR BY WAY OF CONTRAST WE OFFER OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE THAT THE BOTTOM OF A SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL POND HAD DROPPED OUT
3240-131231-0045 I HAVE A GREAT MANY NOTES UPON THE FALL OF FISHES DESPITE THE DIFFICULTY THESE RECORDS HAVE IN GETTING THEMSELVES PUBLISHED BUT I PICK OUT THE INSTANCES THAT ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SUPER GEOGRAPHICAL ACCEPTANCES
3240-131231-0047 A REGION OF INERTNESS TO THIS EARTH'S GRAVITATION OF COURSE HOWEVER A REGION THAT BY THE FLUX AND VARIATION OF ALL THINGS MUST AT TIMES BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT AFTERWARD OUR HERESY WILL BIFURCATE
3240-131231-0048 IN AMIABLE ACCOMMODATION TO THE CRUCIFIXION IT'LL GET I THINK BUT SO IMPRESSED ARE WE WITH THE DATUM THAT THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF SMALL FROGS THAT HAVE FALLEN FROM THE SKY
3240-131231-0050 SOMETHING ELSE APART FROM OUR THREE MAIN INTERESTS IS A PHENOMENON THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT ONE MIGHT CALL AN ALTERNATING SERIES OF FALLS OF FISHES WHATEVER THE SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE
3240-131231-0051 JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0053 MORADABAD INDIA JULY EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX LIVING AGE
3240-131231-0054 ROSS SHIRE SCOTLAND EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0056 FERIDPOOR INDIA FEBRUARY NINETEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY
3240-131231-0057 DISREGARDING SERIAL SIGNIFICANCE OR MECHANICAL UNINTELLIGENT REPULSIVE REFLEX IS THAT THE FISHES OF INDIA DID NOT FALL FROM THE SKY THAT THEY WERE FOUND UPON THE GROUND AFTER TORRENTIAL RAINS BECAUSE STREAMS HAD OVERFLOWED AND HAD THEN RECEDED
3240-131231-0059 REMAIN AND DRY OR EVEN PUTREFY THEN SOMETIMES FALLING BY ATMOSPHERIC DISLODGMENT AFTER A TREMENDOUS DELUGE OF RAIN ONE OF THE HEAVIEST FALLS ON RECORD
3240-131231-0060 JULY TWENTY FIFTH EIGHTEEN FIFTY
3240-131231-0062 TELLS OF A FALL OF LIVING FISHES SOME OF THEM HAVING BEEN PLACED IN A TANK WHERE THEY SURVIVED THAT OCCURRED IN INDIA ABOUT TWENTY MILES SOUTH OF CALCUTTA SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE A WITNESS OF THIS FALL SAYS
3240-131231-0063 THE MOST STRANGE THING WHICH EVER STRUCK ME WAS THAT THE FISH DID NOT FALL HELTER SKELTER OR HERE AND THERE BUT THEY FELL IN A STRAIGHT LINE NOT MORE THAN A CUBIT IN BREADTH
3240-131231-0065 OR TO THOSE WHO HOLD OUT FOR SEGREGATION IN A WHIRLWIND OR THAT OBJECTS SAY TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE LIGHTER WE POINT OUT THAT SOME OF THESE FISHES WERE TWICE AS HEAVY AS OTHERS IN THE JOURNAL OF THE ASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL
3240-131231-0066 SOME OF THE FISH WERE FRESH BUT OTHERS WERE ROTTEN AND WITHOUT HEADS AMONG THE NUMBER WHICH I GOT FIVE WERE FRESH AND THE REST STINKING AND HEADLESS THEY REMIND US OF HIS GRACE'S OBSERVATION OF SOME PAGES BACK
3240-131231-0068 A CORRESPONDENT WRITES FROM THE DOVE MARINE LABORATORY CUTTERCOATS ENGLAND THAT AT HINDON A SUBURB OF SUNDERLAND AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS OF SMALL FISHES IDENTIFIED AS SAND EELS HAD FALLEN
3240-131231-0069 AGAIN THE SMALL AREA ABOUT SIXTY BY THIRTY YARDS THE FALL OCCURRED DURING A HEAVY RAIN THAT WAS ACCOMPANIED BY THUNDER
3240-131231-0071 ACCORDING TO WITNESSES THE FALL UPON THIS SMALL AREA OCCUPIED TEN MINUTES I CANNOT THINK OF A CLEARER INDICATION OF A DIRECT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE AND
3240-131231-0072 THE FISH WERE ALL DEAD AND INDEED STIFF AND HARD WHEN PICKED UP IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OCCURRENCE BY ALL OF WHICH I MEAN THAT WE HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO PILE UP OUR DATA OF THINGS THAT FALL FROM A STATIONARY SOURCE OVERHEAD
3240-131231-0074 BUT IF EVER ANYTHING DID GO UP FROM THIS EARTH'S SURFACE AND STAY UP THOSE DAMNED THINGS MAY HAVE MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW MAY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IN A TORNADO IN WISCONSIN MAY TWENTY THIRD EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
3240-131231-0075 A BARN AND A HORSE WERE CARRIED COMPLETELY AWAY AND NEITHER HORSE NOR BARN NOR ANY PORTION OF EITHER HAVE SINCE BEEN FOUND AFTER THAT WHICH WOULD BE A LITTLE STRONG WERE IT NOT FOR A STEADY IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DIGESTIONS THAT I NOTE AS WE GO ALONG
3240-131231-0077 FELL A SMALL PIECE OF ALABASTER THAT AT BOVINA EIGHT MILES FROM VICKSBURG FELL A GOPHER TURTLE THEY FELL IN A HAILSTORM THIS ITEM WAS WIDELY COPIED AT THE TIME FOR INSTANCE NATURE
3240-131231-0078 AS TO DISCUSSION NOT A WORD OR SCIENCE AND ITS CONTINUITY WITH PRESBYTERIANISM DATA LIKE THIS ARE DAMNED AT BIRTH THE WEATHER REVIEW DOES SPRINKLE OR BAPTIZE OR ATTEMPT TO SAVE THIS INFANT
3240-131231-0080 AN EXAMINATION OF THE WEATHER MAP SHOWS THAT THESE HAILSTORMS OCCUR ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF A REGION OF COLD NORTHERLY WINDS AND WERE BUT A SMALL PART OF A SERIES OF SIMILAR STORMS
3240-131231-0081 OF ALL INCREDIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO CHOOSE FROM I GIVE FIRST PLACE TO A NOTION OF A WHIRLWIND POUNCING UPON A REGION
3240-131231-0083 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED SELECTION THERE IS NO RECORD OF THE FALL OF OTHER OBJECTS BUT THERE IS NO ATTEMPT IN THE REVIEW TO SPECIFY A WHIRLWIND THESE STRANGELY ASSOCIATED THINGS WERE REMARKABLY SEPARATED THEY FELL EIGHT MILES APART
3240-131231-0084 THEN AS IF THERE WERE REAL REASONING THEY MUST HAVE BEEN HIGH TO FALL WITH SUCH DIVERGENCE OR ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN CARRIED PARTLY HORIZONTALLY EIGHT MILES FARTHER THAN THE OTHER BUT EITHER SUPPOSITION ARGUES FOR POWER MORE THAN THAT OF A LOCAL WHIRL OR GUST
3240-131232-0000 THEN I THINK OF A HURRICANE THAT OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE MAY ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR NO I DON'T LOOK FOR IT AND INEVITABLY FIND IT OR THAT THINGS CAN GO UP SO HIGH IN HURRICANES THAT THEY STAY UP INDEFINITELY
3240-131232-0001 BUT MAY AFTER A WHILE BE SHAKEN DOWN BY STORMS
3240-131232-0003 FINAL PRECIPITATION BY ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE WITH HAIL OR THAT HAILSTONES TOO WHEN LARGE ARE PHENOMENA OF SUSPENSION OF LONG DURATION THAT IT IS HIGHLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE VERY LARGE ONES COULD BECOME SO GREAT ONLY IN FALLING FROM THE CLOUDS
3240-131232-0004 LONG DURATION OTHER INDICATIONS OF LONG DURATION I THINK OF A REGION SOMEWHERE ABOVE THIS EARTH'S SURFACE IN WHICH GRAVITATION IS INOPERATIVE AND IS NOT GOVERNED BY THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE
3240-131232-0006 HORSES AND BARNS AND ELEPHANTS AND FLIES AND DODOES MOAS AND PTERODACTYLS LEAVES FROM MODERN TREES AND LEAVES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS ERA ALL HOWEVER TENDING TO DISINTEGRATE INTO HOMOGENEOUS LOOKING MUDS OR DUSTS
3240-131232-0007 RED OR BLACK OR YELLOW TREASURE TROVES FOR THE PALAEONTOLOGISTS AND FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS ACCUMULATIONS OF CENTURIES CYCLONES OF EGYPT GREECE AND ASSYRIA FISHES DRIED AND HARD THERE A SHORT TIME OTHERS THERE LONG ENOUGH TO PUTREFY
3240-131232-0009 ORTHODOXY ACCEPTS THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES GRAVITATION IS ONE OF THESE FORCES ALL OTHER FORCES HAVE PHENOMENA OF REPULSION AND OF INERTNESS IRRESPECTIVE OF DISTANCE AS WELL AS OF ATTRACTION
3240-131232-0010 BUT NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION ADMITS ATTRACTION ONLY THEN NEWTONIAN GRAVITATION CAN BE ONLY ONE THIRD ACCEPTABLE EVEN TO THE ORTHODOX OR THERE IS DENIAL OF THE CORRELATION AND EQUIVALENCE OF FORCES OR STILL SIMPLER HERE ARE THE DATA
3240-131232-0012 THAT NEVER HAS A FALL OF FULL GROWN FROGS BEEN REPORTED ALWAYS FROGS A FEW MONTHS OLD IT SOUNDS POSITIVE BUT IF THERE BE SUCH REPORTS THEY ARE SOMEWHERE OUT OF MY RANGE OF READING BUT TADPOLES WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SKY THAN WOULD FROGS
3240-131232-0013 LITTLE OR BIG IF SUCH FALLS BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHIRLWINDS AND MORE LIKELY TO FALL FROM THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA IF THOUGH VERY TENTATIVELY AND PROVISIONALLY WE ACCEPT THE SUPER SARGASSO SEA
3240-131232-0015 THERE ARE OTHER DATA THAT ARE SIMILAR TO DATA OF FALLS OF FISHES SCIENCE GOSSIP
3240-131232-0016 THAT SMALL SNAILS OF A LAND SPECIES HAD FALLEN NEAR REDRUTH CORNWALL JULY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX DURING A HEAVY THUNDERSTORM ROADS AND FIELDS STREWN WITH THEM SO THAT THEY WERE GATHERED UP BY THE HATFUL
3240-131232-0018 OF GREAT AND DESERVED REPUTE I THOUGHT I SHOULD FOR ONCE LIKE TO TRACE THE ORIGIN OF ONE OF THESE FABULOUS TALES OUR OWN ACCEPTANCE IS THAT JUSTICE CANNOT BE IN AN INTERMEDIATE EXISTENCE
3240-131232-0019 IN WHICH THERE CAN BE APPROXIMATION ONLY TO JUSTICE OR TO INJUSTICE THAT TO BE FAIR IS TO HAVE NO OPINION AT ALL THAT TO BE HONEST IS TO BE UNINTERESTED THAT TO INVESTIGATE IS TO ADMIT PREJUDICE THAT NOBODY HAS EVER REALLY INVESTIGATED ANYTHING
3240-131232-0021 IN THE FIRST PLACE HE FOUND THAT THE SNAILS HAD APPEARED AFTER THE RAIN THAT ASTONISHED RUSTICS HAD JUMPED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY HAD FALLEN HE MET ONE PERSON WHO SAID THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SNAILS FALL THIS WAS HIS ERROR SAYS THE INVESTIGATOR
3240-131232-0022 IN SUCH QUANTITIES THAT THEY WERE SHOVELED UP IT IS SAID THAT THE SNAILS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A LOCAL SPECIES
3240-131232-0024 THAT ACCORDING TO DAS WETTER DECEMBER EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO UPON AUGUST NINTH EIGHTEEN NINETY TWO A YELLOW CLOUD APPEARED OVER PADERBORN GERMANY FROM THIS CLOUD FELL A TORRENTIAL RAIN IN WHICH WERE HUNDREDS OF MUSSELS
3240-131232-0025 THERE IS NO MENTION OF WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE NOR OF A WHIRLWIND LIZARDS
3240-131232-0027 THESE DATA HAVE ANY MEANING OR LACK OF MEANING OR DEGREE OF DAMNATION YOU PLEASE BUT IN THE MATTER OF THE FALL THAT OCCURRED AT MEMPHIS TENNESSEE OCCUR SOME STRONG SIGNIFICANCES
3240-131232-0028 OUR QUASI REASONING UPON THIS SUBJECT APPLIES TO ALL SEGREGATIONS SO FAR CONSIDERED MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THAT
3240-131232-0030 BUT NONE WERE FOUND ON ROOFS OR ANY OTHER ELEVATION ABOVE GROUND AND NONE WERE SEEN TO FALL IF YOU PREFER TO BELIEVE THAT THE SNAKES HAD ALWAYS BEEN THERE OR HAD BEEN UPON THE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE AND THAT IT WAS ONLY THAT SOMETHING OCCURRED TO CALL SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM
3240-131232-0031 IN THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHY THAT'S SENSIBLE THAT'S THE COMMON SENSE THAT HAS BEEN AGAINST US FROM THE FIRST IT IS NOT SAID WHETHER THE SNAKES WERE OF A KNOWN SPECIES OR NOT
3240-131232-0033 STONES FENCE RAILS LIMBS OF TREES SAY THAT THE SNAKES OCCUPIED THE NEXT GRADATION AND WOULD BE THE NEXT TO FALL
3240-131232-0034 AGAIN OURS IS THE OBJECTION AGAINST SUCH SELECTIVENESS BY A WHIRLWIND CONCEIVABLY A WHIRLWIND COULD SCOOP OUT A DEN OF HIBERNATING SNAKES WITH STONES AND EARTH AND AN INFINITUDE OF OTHER DEBRIS SNATCHING UP DOZENS OF SNAKES
3240-131232-0036 RECORDS THE FALL AND SAYS THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF THEM THE USUAL WHIRLWIND EXPLANATION IS GIVEN BUT IN WHAT LOCALITY SNAKES EXIST IN SUCH ABUNDANCE IS YET A MYSTERY THIS MATTER OF ENORMOUSNESS OF NUMBERS
3240-131232-0037 SUGGESTS TO ME SOMETHING OF A MIGRATORY NATURE BUT THAT SNAKES IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT MIGRATE IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY IF EVER AS TO FALLS OR FLUTTERINGS OF WINGED INSECTS FROM THE SKY PREVAILING NOTIONS OF SWARMING WOULD SEEM EXPLANATORY ENOUGH
3240-131232-0039 FALL OF ANTS CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR SOME WERE WINGLESS
3240-131232-0040 ENORMOUS FALL OF ANTS NANCY FRANCE JULY TWENTY FIRST EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MOST OF THEM WERE WINGLESS
3242-8112-0001 EIGHT TONS OF HIS LAB EQUIPMENT PLUS HIS SPECIAL U LEAGUE GUARDS OH TRIGGER PICKED UP THE PUYA GLASS SHE LOOKED INTO IT IT WAS EMPTY MOVING WHERE SHE ASKED MANON SAID THE COMMISSIONER TELL YOU ABOUT THAT LATER
3242-8112-0002 EVERY LAST MUSCLE IN TRIGGER'S BODY SEEMED TO GO LIMP SIMULTANEOUSLY SHE SETTLED BACK SLIGHTLY IN THE CHAIR SURPRISED BY THE FORCE OF THE REACTION SHE HADN'T REALIZED BY NOW HOW KEYED UP SHE WAS SHE SIGHED A SMALL SIGH
3242-8112-0004 QUILLAN DOES HAVE A DEGREE IN SUBSPACE ENGINEERING AND GETS ASSIGNED TO THE ENGINEERS NOW AND THEN BUT HIS REAL JOB'S SPACE SCOUT INTELLIGENCE TRIGGER NODDED I'D ALMOST GUESSED IT SHE GAVE QUILLAN ANOTHER SMILE
3242-8112-0005 AND NOW SAID THE COMMISSIONER WE'LL TALK MORE FREELY WE TELL MANTELISH JUST AS LITTLE AS WE CAN TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH TRIGGER THE PROFESSOR IS A TERRIBLE HANDICAP ON AN OPERATION LIKE THIS I UNDERSTAND HE WAS A GREAT FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER'S YES SHE SAID
3242-8112-0007 LOOKING FOR GESS FAYLE AND THE KEY UNIT HOLATI TATE SAID THAT'S ABOUT IT WE'RE ONE OF A FEW THOUSAND FEDERATION GROUPS ASSIGNED TO THE SAME GENERAL JOB EACH GROUP WORKS AT ITS SPECIALTIES AND THE INFORMATION GETS CORRELATED
3242-8112-0008 IN WHAT WAY TRIGGER ASKED WELL SUPPOSE THAT KEY UNIT IS LOST AND STAYS LOST SUPPOSE ALL THE OTHER PLASMOIDS PUT TOGETHER DON'T CONTAIN ENOUGH INFORMATION TO SHOW HOW THE OLD GALACTICS PRODUCED THE THINGS AND GOT THEM TO OPERATE
3242-8112-0010 THERE SEEM TO BE TOO MANY BASIC FACTORS MISSING IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP A WHOLE NEW CLASS OF SCIENCES FIRST AND THAT COULD TAKE A FEW CENTURIES WELL TRIGGER ADMITTED I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT THE THINGS INDEFINITELY
3242-8112-0011 SAME HERE THE PLASMOID NABOB AGREED UNGRATEFULLY WEIRD BEASTIES BUT LET'S SEE AT PRESENT THERE ARE TWELVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER WORLDS TO THE FEDERATION AREN'T THERE MORE OR LESS
3242-8112-0013 THEY'VE ALL BEEN TOLD WE'RE HEADING FOR A NEW GOLDEN AGE COURTESY OF THE PLASMOID SCIENCE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY HAS BELIEVED IT NOW THERE'S CONSIDERABLE DOUBT
3242-8112-0014 OF COURSE PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY IS GOING TO GET VERY UNHAPPY EH THAT SAID COMMISSIONER TATE IS ONLY A LITTLE OF IT YES THE THING ISN'T JUST LOST SOMEBODY'S GOT IT VERY LIKELY TRIGGER NODDED
3242-8112-0016 THEIR TREATIES OF LIMITATION WOULDN'T HAVE LET THEM GET INTO THE PLASMOID PIE UNTIL THE OTHERS HAD BEEN AT IT A DECADE OR SO THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE EAGER THERE WAS A LITTLE PAUSE THEN TRIGGER SAID LORDY
3242-8112-0017 THE THING COULD EVEN SET OFF ANOTHER STRING OF WARS THAT'S A POINT THE COUNCIL IS NERVOUS ABOUT HE SAID WELL IT CERTAINLY IS A MESS YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE FEDERATION MIGHT HAVE HAD A SECURITY CHIEF IN ON THAT FIRST OPERATION
3242-8112-0019 HOLATI COULD THOSE THINGS EVER BECOME AS VALUABLE AS PEOPLE KEEP SAYING IT'S ALL SOUNDED A LITTLE EXAGGERATED TO ME THE COMMISSIONER SAID HE'D WONDERED ABOUT IT TOO
3242-8112-0020 I'M NOT ENOUGH OF A BIOLOGIST TO MAKE AN EDUCATED GUESS WHAT IT SEEMS TO BOIL DOWN TO IS THAT THEY MIGHT WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO TEMPT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GAMBLE VERY HIGH FOR A CHANCE TO GET CONTROL OF THE PLASMOID PROCESS
3242-8112-0022 TRIGGER GLANCED DOWN THE PLASMOID LAY THERE SOME INCHES FROM THE SIDE OF HER HAND YOU KNOW SHE SAID UNCOMFORTABLY OLD REPULSIVE MOVED AGAIN WHILE WE WERE TALKING TOWARDS MY HAND SHE DREW THE HAND AWAY
3242-8112-0023 I WAS WATCHING IT MAJOR QUILLAN SAID REASSURINGLY FROM THE END OF THE TABLE
3242-8112-0025 HE WAS CURIOUS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T EVEN GUESS AT WHAT ITS FUNCTION WAS IT WAS JUST LYING THERE IN A CUBICLE SO HE DID CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTING WITH IT WHILE HE WAITED FOR GESS FAYLE TO SHOW UP
3242-8112-0026 AND LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS FIDGETED AROUND HOPING TO GET THE KIND OF REPORT FROM MANTELISH AND FAYLE THAT MANTELISH THOUGHT THEY'D ALREADY RECEIVED THEY WERE WONDERING WHERE FAYLE WAS TOO BUT THEY KNEW FAYLE WAS SECURITY SO THEY DIDN'T LIKE TO GET TOO NOSY
3242-8112-0028 MANTELISH BEGAN TO GET RESULTS WITH IT THE COMMISSIONER SAID ONE EXPERIMENT WAS RATHER STARTLING HE'D BEEN TRYING THAT ELECTRICAL STIMULATION BUSINESS NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL HE HAD FINISHED THEN HE TOUCHED THE PLASMOID AND IT FED THE WHOLE CHARGE BACK TO HIM
3242-8112-0029 SHE LAUGHED DELIGHTEDLY GOOD FOR REPULSIVE STOOD UP FOR HIS RIGHTS EH MANTELISH GAINED SOME SUCH IMPRESSION ANYWAY HE BECAME MORE CAUTIOUS WITH IT AFTER THAT AND THEN HE LEARNED SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IMPORTANT
3242-8112-0031 THE TWO LAB PLASMOIDS STOPPED MOVING WHILE HE WAS THERE THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE
3242-8112-0032 RIGHT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT AND THEN LOCATED ANOTHER MOVING PLASMOID
3242-8112-0034 BUT HIS TWO LAB GUARDS AND ONE OF THE RAIDERS WERE KILLED THE OTHERS GOT AWAY GESS FAYLE'S DEFECTION WAS A CERTAINTY BY THEN AND EVERYBODY WAS VERY NERVOUS THE FEDS GOT THERE FAST AND DEAD BRAINED THE RAIDER THEY LEARNED JUST TWO THINGS
3242-8112-0035 ONE HE'D BEEN MIND BLOCKED AND COULDN'T HAVE SPILLED ANY SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION EVEN IF THEY HAD GOT HIM ALIVE THE OTHER ITEM THEY DREW FROM HIS BRAIN WAS A CLEAR IMPRESSION OF THE TARGET OF THE RAID THE PROFESSOR'S PAL HERE UH HUH TRIGGER SAID LOST IN THOUGHT
3242-8112-0037 SO THEY NEED IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE KEY UNIT TRIGGER ASKED PROBABLY THAT MAKES EVERYTHING LOOK VERY MUCH BETTER DOESN'T IT QUITE A LITTLE HE SAID THE UNIT MAY NOT WORK
3242-8112-0038 MANTELISH TALKS OF SOMETHING HE CALLS PROXIMITY INFLUENCE
3242-8112-0040 WE GOT THEM DEAD WE GOT THEM ALIVE IT DIDN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE THEY WERE HIRED HANDS VERY EXPENSIVE HIRED HANDS BUT STILL JUST THAT MOST OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW A THING WE COULD USE THE ONES THAT DID KNOW SOMETHING WERE MIND BLOCKED AGAIN
3242-8112-0041 I THOUGHT TRIGGER SAID REFLECTIVELY YOU COULD UN BLOCK SOMEONE LIKE THAT YOU CAN SOMETIMES IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT IT AND IF YOU HAVE TIME ENOUGH WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO WAIT A YEAR THEY DIED BEFORE THEY COULD TELL US ANYTHING
3242-8112-0043 WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GRAB ME I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET WE'RE HOPING WE WILL IN A VERY FEW DAYS IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T TELL ME ABOUT
3242-8112-0044 I CAN TELL YOU MOST OF WHAT I KNOW AT THE MOMENT SAID THE COMMISSIONER
3242-67153-0001 AND ABOUT THE ONLY TIME OUR PRODUCTS ARE GIVEN LATIN NAMES IS WHEN THE STATE BOARD OF HEALTH CONDEMNS THEM SO I THINK YOU'LL FIND IT SAFE TO GO SHORT A LITTLE ON THE FRILLS OF EDUCATION IF YOU WANT THEM BAD ENOUGH YOU'LL FIND A WAY TO PICK THEM UP LATER AFTER BUSINESS HOURS
3242-67153-0002 BUT I WANTED YOU TO FORM GOOD MENTAL HABITS JUST AS I WANT YOU TO HAVE CLEAN STRAIGHT PHYSICAL ONES BECAUSE I WAS RUN THROUGH A THRESHING MACHINE WHEN I WAS A BOY AND DIDN'T BEGIN TO GET THE STRAW OUT OF MY HAIR TILL I WAS PAST THIRTY
3242-67153-0004 THE LORD LET US IN ON THE GROUND FLOOR GAVE US CORNER LOTS AND THEN STARTED IN TO IMPROVE THE ADJACENT PROPERTY WE DIDN'T HAVE TO KNOW FRACTIONS TO FIGURE OUT OUR PROFITS NOW A MERCHANT NEEDS ASTRONOMY TO SEE THEM AND WHEN HE LOCATES THEM THEY ARE OUT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE FIFTH DECIMAL PLACE
3242-67153-0005 AND THERE'RE JUST AS MANY CHANCES FOR A FELLOW AS EVER BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE GUN SHY AND YOU CAN'T CATCH THEM BY ANY SUCH COARSE METHOD AS PUTTING SALT ON THEIR TAILS THIRTY YEARS AGO YOU COULD TAKE AN OLD MUZZLE LOADER AND KNOCK OVER PLENTY OF DUCKS IN THE CITY LIMITS
3242-67153-0007 DRY SALT FOR THE NIGGERS DOWN SOUTH AND SUGAR CURED FOR THE WHITE FOLKS UP NORTH EVERYTHING ELSE WAS SAUSAGE OR THROWN AWAY BUT WHEN WE GET THROUGH WITH A HOG NOWADAYS HE'S SCATTERED THROUGH A HUNDRED DIFFERENT CANS AND PACKAGES AND HE'S ALL ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT WE USED TO THROW AWAY IS OUR PROFIT
3242-67153-0008 IT TAKES DOCTORS LAWYERS ENGINEERS POETS AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO RUN THE BUSINESS AND I RECKON THAT IMPROVEMENTS WHICH CALL FOR PARSONS WILL BE CREEPING IN NEXT NATURALLY A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTS TO HOLD HIS OWN WHEN HE IS THROWN IN WITH A LOT OF MEN LIKE THESE
3242-67153-0010 BUT OLD DURHAM FOUND OUT WHAT EVERY ONE LEARNS WHO GETS HIS AMBITIONS MIXED UP WITH NUMBER TWO RED THAT THERE'S A HEAP OF IT LYING AROUND LOOSE IN THE COUNTRY THE BEARS DID QUICK WORK AND KEPT THE CASH WHEAT COMING IN SO LIVELY THAT ONE SETTLING DAY
3242-67153-0011 AND THAT HE HAD BETTER TURN HIS ATTENTION TO THE STOCKS OF MESS PORK
3242-67153-0013 FINALLY AFTER ABOUT A MONTH OF THIS HE WORE ME DOWN SO THAT I STOPPED HIM ONE DAY AS HE WAS PASSING ME ON THE STREET I THOUGHT I'D FIND OUT IF HE REALLY WAS SO RED HOT TO WORK AS HE PRETENDED TO BE
3242-67153-0014 BESIDES I FELT THAT PERHAPS I HADN'T TREATED THE BOY JUST RIGHT AS I HAD DELIVERED QUITE A JAG OF THAT WHEAT TO HIS FATHER MYSELF HELLO JIM I CALLED DO YOU STILL WANT THAT JOB YES SIR HE ANSWERED QUICK AS LIGHTNING WELL
3242-67153-0016 I THOUGHT THAT WOULD SETTLE JIM AND LET ME OUT FOR IT'S NO JOKE LUGGING BEEF OR ROLLING BARRELS AND TIERCES A HUNDRED YARDS OR SO TO THE CARS BUT JIM CAME RIGHT BACK AT ME WITH DONE WHO'LL I REPORT TO
3242-67153-0017 THAT SPORTY WAY OF ANSWERING AS IF HE WAS CLOSING A BET MADE ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE WAS NOT CUT OUT FOR A BUTCHER BUT I TOLD HIM AND OFF HE STARTED HOT FOOT TO FIND THE FOREMAN I SENT WORD BY ANOTHER ROUTE TO SEE THAT HE GOT PLENTY TO DO
3242-67153-0019 IT WAS JUST AS I THOUGHT JIM WAS LAZY BUT HE HAD PUT THE HOUSE IN THE WAY OF SAVING SO MUCH MONEY THAT I COULDN'T FIRE HIM SO I RAISED HIS SALARY AND MADE HIM AN ASSISTANT TIMEKEEPER AND CHECKER
3242-67153-0020 JIM KEPT AT THIS FOR THREE OR FOUR MONTHS UNTIL HIS FEET BEGAN TO HURT HIM I GUESS AND THEN HE WAS OUT OF A JOB AGAIN IT SEEMS HE HAD HEARD SOMETHING OF A NEW MACHINE FOR REGISTERING THE MEN THAT DID AWAY WITH MOST OF THE TIMEKEEPERS EXCEPT THE FELLOWS WHO WATCHED THE MACHINES
3242-67153-0022 I WAS BEGINNING TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN JIM SO I BROUGHT HIM UP INTO THE OFFICE AND SET HIM TO COPYING CIRCULAR LETTERS WE USED TO SEND OUT A RAFT OF THEM TO THE TRADE THAT WAS JUST BEFORE THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF TYPEWRITERS WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STAGE
3242-67153-0023 BUT JIM HADN'T BEEN IN THE OFFICE PLUGGING AWAY AT THE LETTERS FOR A MONTH BEFORE HE HAD THE WRITER'S CRAMP AND BEGAN NOSING AROUND AGAIN THE FIRST THING I KNEW HE WAS SICKING THE AGENTS FOR THE NEW TYPEWRITING MACHINE ON TO ME
3242-67153-0025 JIM MADE TWO TRIPS WITHOUT SELLING ENOUGH TO KEEP THEM WORKING OVERTIME AT THE FACTORY AND THEN HE CAME INTO MY OFFICE WITH A LONG STORY ABOUT HOW WE WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG SAID WE OUGHT TO GO FOR THE CONSUMER BY ADVERTISING
3242-67153-0026 BUT JIM JUST KEPT PLUGGING AWAY AT ME BETWEEN TRIPS UNTIL FINALLY I TOOK HIM OFF THE ROAD AND TOLD HIM TO GO AHEAD AND TRY IT IN A SMALL WAY JIM PRETTY NEARLY SCARED ME TO DEATH THAT FIRST YEAR
3242-67153-0028 I REMEMBER ONE PICTURE HE GOT OUT SHOWING SIXTEEN COWS STANDING BETWEEN SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A LETTER PRESS AND TELLING HOW EVERY POUND OR SO OF GRAHAM'S EXTRACT CONTAINED THE JUICE SQUEEZED FROM A HERD OF STEERS IF AN EXPLORER STARTED FOR THE NORTH POLE
3242-67153-0029 JIM WOULD SEND HIM A CASE OF EXTRACT AND THEN ADVERTISE THAT IT WAS THE GREAT HEAT MAKER FOR COLD CLIMATES AND IF SOME OTHER FELLOW STARTED ACROSS AFRICA HE SENT HIM A CASE TOO AND ADVERTISED WHAT A BULLY DRINK IT WAS SERVED UP WITH A LITTLE ICE
3242-67153-0031 WHEN THE ORDERS FOR EXTRACT BEGAN TO LOOK UP AND HE GOT A REPRIEVE THEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE EXPENSES AND HE GOT A PARDON AND FINALLY A RUSH CAME THAT LEFT HIM HIGH AND DRY IN A PERMANENT PLACE
3242-67153-0032 JIM WAS ALL RIGHT IN HIS WAY BUT IT WAS A NEW WAY AND I HADN'T BEEN BROAD GAUGED ENOUGH TO SEE THAT IT WAS A BETTER WAY THAT WAS WHERE I CAUGHT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AND BUSINESS
3242-67153-0034 I SUPPOSE YOU'RE ASKING WHY IF I'M SO HOT FOR EDUCATION I'M AGAINST THIS POST GRADUATE COURSE
3242-67153-0035 I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ELECTED PRESIDENT OF YOUR CLASS I'M GLAD THE BOYS AREN'T DOWN ON YOU BUT WHILE THE MOST POPULAR MAN IN HIS CLASS ISN'T ALWAYS A FAILURE IN BUSINESS BEING AS POPULAR AS THAT TAKES UP A HEAP OF TIME
3242-67153-0037 I SIMPLY MENTION THIS IN PASSING I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ULTIMATE GOOD SENSE AND I GUESS YOU'LL SEE THE POINT WITHOUT MY ELABORATING WITH A MEAT AX MY REASONS FOR THINKING THAT YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH COLLEGE FOR THE PRESENT
3242-67168-0000 I NEVER SELL GOODS WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE I CAN FIND THEM WHEN I WANT THEM AND IF THESE FELLOWS TRY TO PUT THEIR FOREFEET IN THE TROUGH OR START ANY SHOVING AND CROWDING THEY'RE GOING TO FIND ME FORGETTING MY TABLE MANNERS TOO
3242-67168-0002 I RECKON THERE HASN'T BEEN A TIME IN TWENTY YEARS WHEN THERE WASN'T A NICE GATES AJAR PIECE ALL MADE UP AND READY FOR ME IN SOME OFFICE NEAR THE BOARD OF TRADE BUT THE FIRST ESSENTIAL OF A QUIET FUNERAL IS A WILLING CORPSE AND I'M STILL SITTING UP AND TAKING NOURISHMENT
3242-67168-0003 ABUSE AND FLATTERY THE FIRST CAN'T HARM YOU AND THE SECOND CAN'T HELP YOU SOME MEN ARE LIKE YELLOW DOGS
3242-67168-0005 AND THE SHORTS ALLOWED THAT I WAS AN INFAMOUS OLD ROBBER WHO WAS STEALING THE PORK OUT OF THE WORKINGMAN'S POT AS LONG AS YOU CAN'T PLEASE BOTH SIDES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S NOTHING LIKE PLEASING YOUR OWN SIDE
3242-67168-0006 I REMEMBER ONCE I HAD A VACANT LOT OUT ON THE AVENUE AND A LADY CAME IN TO MY OFFICE AND IN A SOOTHING SYRUPY WAY ASKED IF I WOULD LEND IT TO HER AS SHE WANTED TO BUILD A CRECHE ON IT I HESITATED A LITTLE BECAUSE I HAD NEVER HEARD OF A CRECHE BEFORE
3242-67168-0008 OF COURSE THERE WAS NOTHING IN THAT TO GET OUR PASTOR OR THE POLICE AFTER ME SO I TOLD HER TO GO AHEAD SHE WENT OFF HAPPY BUT ABOUT A WEEK LATER SHE DROPPED IN AGAIN LOOKING SORT OF DISSATISFIED TO FIND OUT IF I WOULDN'T BUILD THE CRECHE ITSELF
3242-67168-0009 IT SEEMED LIKE A WORTHY OBJECT SO I SENT SOME CARPENTERS OVER TO KNOCK TOGETHER A LONG FRAME PAVILION SHE WAS MIGHTY GRATEFUL YOU BET AND I DIDN'T SEE HER AGAIN FOR A FORTNIGHT THEN SHE CALLED BY TO SAY THAT SO LONG AS I WAS IN THE BUSINESS AND THEY DIDN'T COST ME ANYTHING SPECIAL
3242-67168-0011 TO ASK WHY I HADN'T HAD IT PAINTED I WAS TOO BUSY THAT MORNING TO QUARREL SO I SENT WORD THAT I WOULD FIX IT UP AND WHEN I WAS DRIVING BY THERE NEXT DAY THE PAINTERS WERE HARD AT WORK ON IT
3242-67168-0012 GRAHAM'S EXTRACT IT MAKES THE WEAK STRONG
3242-67168-0014 THEN I FOUND A FELLOW WHO WANTED TO BUILD IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SOLD HIM THE LOT CHEAP AND GOT OUT OF THE CRECHE INDUSTRY
3242-67168-0015 BUT THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER PUT INTO IT WHICH DIDN'T DRAW DIVIDENDS IN FUN OR DOLLARS WAS WORRY THAT IS A BRANCH OF THE TRADE WHICH YOU WANT TO LEAVE TO OUR COMPETITORS I'VE ALWAYS FOUND WORRYING A BLAMED SIGHT MORE UNCERTAIN THAN HORSE RACING IT'S HARDER TO PICK A WINNER AT IT
3242-67168-0017 A BUSY MAN HAS NO TIME TO BOTHER WITH IT HE CAN ALWAYS FIND PLENTY OF OLD WOMEN IN SKIRTS OR TROUSERS TO SPEND THEIR DAYS WORRYING OVER THEIR OWN TROUBLES AND TO SIT UP NIGHTS WAKING HIS SPEAKING OF HANDING OVER YOUR WORRIES TO OTHERS NATURALLY CALLS TO MIND THE WIDOW WILLIAMS AND HER SON BUD
3242-67168-0018 WHO WAS A PLAYMATE OF MINE WHEN I WAS A BOY BUD WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE WIDOW'S TROUBLES AND SHE WAS A WOMAN WHOSE TROUBLES SELDOM CAME SINGLY HAD FOURTEEN ALTOGETHER AND FOUR PAIR OF EM WERE TWINS
3242-67168-0020 AND SOMEWAYS THE WHOLE DROVE ALWAYS SHOWED UP SAFE AND DIRTY ABOUT MEAL TIME
3242-67168-0021 AND SO WHEN BUD'S CLOTHES WERE FOUND AT THE SWIMMING HOLE ONE DAY AND NO BUD INSIDE THEM SHE DIDN'T TAKE ON UP TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD BROUGHT THE NEWS AND WHO WERE STANDING AROUND WAITING FOR HER TO GO OFF INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL IN THE WAY OF HIGH STRIKES
3242-67168-0023 AND EVERY ONE JUST QUIT WORK TO TELL EACH OTHER WHAT A NOBLE LITTLE FELLOW HE WAS AND HOW HIS MOTHER HADN'T DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH A BRIGHT LITTLE SUNBEAM IN HER HOME AND TO DRAG THE RIVER BETWEEN TALKS BUT THEY COULDN'T GET A RISE
3242-67168-0024 BUT FINALLY AT THE END OF A WEEK WHEN THEY'D STRAINED THE WHOLE RIVER THROUGH THEIR DRAGS AND HADN'T ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT BUT A COLLECTION OF TIN CANS AND DEAD CATFISH
3242-67168-0026 WELL THE WIDOW SAID SHE RECKONED THAT BOYS OUGHT TO BE LET OUT AS WELL AS IN FOR HALF PRICE AND SO SHE LAID DOWN TWO BITS ALLOWING THAT SHE WANTED A FEW MINUTES PRIVATE CONVERSATION WITH HER BUD
3242-67168-0027 CLYTIE SAID SHE'D DO HER BEST BUT THAT SPIRITS WERE MIGHTY SNIFTY AND HIGH TONED EVEN WHEN THEY'D ONLY BEEN POOR WHITE TRASH ON EARTH AND IT MIGHT MAKE THEM MAD TO BE CALLED AWAY FROM THEIR HIGH JINKS IF THEY WERE TAKING A LITTLE RECREATION OR FROM THEIR HIGH PRICED NEW YORK CUSTOMERS IF THEY WERE WORKING
3242-67168-0029 AND THE OLD MAN RESPONDED PROMPTLY WHERE'S BUD ASKED THE WIDOW
3242-67168-0030 NO THEN HE'D HAVE TO LOOK DOWNSTAIRS FOR HIM CLYTIE TOLD THE WIDOW TO CALL AGAIN AND THEY'D GET HIM SURE SO SHE CAME BACK NEXT DAY AND LAID DOWN A DOLLAR THAT FETCHED OLD BUCK WILLIAMS GHOST ON THE JUMP YOU BET
3242-67168-0032 FOR RIGHT THERE THE OLD LADY GOT UP WITH A MIGHTY SET EXPRESSION AROUND HER LIPS AND MARCHED OUT MUTTERING THAT IT WAS JUST AS SHE HAD THOUGHT ALL ALONG BUD WASN'T THERE AND WHEN THE NEIGHBORS DROPPED IN THAT AFTERNOON TO PLAN OUT A MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HER LOST LAMB
3242-67168-0033 SHE CHASED THEM OFF THE LOT WITH A BROOM
3242-67168-0035 BUT THERE WOULDN'T BE TILL THEN ALTOGETHER IT LOOKED AS IF THERE WAS A HEAP OF TROUBLE COMING TO BUD IF HE HAD MADE ANY MISTAKE AND WAS STILL ALIVE THE WIDOW FOUND HER LOST LAMB HIDING BEHIND A RAIN BARREL WHEN SHE OPENED UP THE HOUSE NEXT MORNING
3242-67168-0036 AND THERE WAS A MIGHTY TOUCHING AND AFFECTING SCENE IN FACT THE WIDOW MUST HAVE TOUCHED HIM AT LEAST A HUNDRED TIMES AND EVERY TIME HE WAS AFFECTED TO TEARS FOR SHE WAS USING A BED SLAT WHICH IS A POWERFULLY STRONG MORAL AGENT FOR MAKING A BOY SEE THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS
3242-67168-0038 BUT IT APPEARED THAT HE LEFT HOME TO GET A FEW INDIAN SCALPS AND THAT HE CAME BACK FOR A LITTLE BACON AND CORN PONE I SIMPLY MENTION THE WIDOW IN PASSING AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT THE TIME TO DO YOUR WORRYING IS WHEN A THING IS ALL OVER AND THAT THE WAY TO DO IT IS TO LEAVE IT TO THE NEIGHBORS
3242-67168-0039 I SAIL FOR HOME TO MORROW
3259-158083-0001 THE AGITATION WOULD CERTAINLY WEAKEN SO THOUGHT THE ADMINISTRATION TO THEIR GREAT SURPRISE HOWEVER IN THE FACE OF THAT RECKLESS AND EXTREME SENTENCE THE LONGEST PICKET LINE OF THE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN FORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER TENTH
3259-158083-0002 FORTY ONE WOMEN PICKETED IN PROTEST AGAINST THIS WANTON PERSECUTION OF THEIR LEADER AS WELL AS AGAINST THE DELAY IN PASSING THE AMENDMENT FACE TO FACE WITH AN EMBARRASSING NUMBER OF PRISONERS THE ADMINISTRATION USED ITS WITS AND DECIDED
3259-158083-0004 IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW WIDELY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATION THIS GROUP OF PICKETS WAS I GIVE ITS PERSONNEL COMPLETE FIRST GROUP NEW YORK MISSUS JOHN WINTERS BRANNAN MISS BELLE SHEINBERG
3259-158083-0005 MISSUS L H HORNSBY

3259-158083-0014 AS SHE SAID IN COURT WE TOOK THIS ACTION WITH GREAT CONSECRATION OF SPIRIT WITH WILLINGNESS TO SACRIFICE PERSONAL LIBERTY
3259-158083-0016 BUT THEIR MINDS WERE TOO FULL OF THE POLITICAL ASPECT OF OUR OFFENSE TO CONCEAL IT THE TRUTH OF THE SITUATION IS THAT THE COURT HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN POWER TO MEET IT THE JUDGE LAMENTED IT IS VERY VERY PUZZLING I FIND YOU GUILTY OF THE OFFENSE CHARGED
3259-158083-0017 BUT WILL TAKE THE MATTER OF SENTENCE UNDER ADVISEMENT AND SO THE GUILTY PICKETS WERE SUMMARILY RELEASED THE ADMINISTRATION DID NOT RELISH THE INCARCERATION OF FORTY ONE WOMEN FOR ANOTHER REASON THAN LIMITED HOUSING ACCOMMODATIONS
3259-158083-0019 OR IT COULD STAND THE REACTION WHICH WAS BOUND TO COME FROM IMPRISONING THEM AND SO THE FORTY ONE WOMEN RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE GATES TO RESUME THEIR PICKETING THEY STOOD GUARD SEVERAL MINUTES BEFORE THE POLICE TAKEN UNAWARES COULD SUMMON SUFFICIENT FORCE TO ARREST THEM
3259-158083-0020 COME BACK ON FRIDAY I AM NOT YET PREPARED TO TRY THE CASE LOGIC DICTATED THAT EITHER WE HAD A RIGHT TO STAND AT THE GATES WITH OUR BANNERS OR WE DID NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT
3259-158083-0022 USING THEIR WELCOME RELEASE TO CONTINUE THEIR PROTEST THE WOMEN AGAIN MARCHED WITH THEIR BANNERS TO THE WHITE HOUSE IN AN ATTEMPT TO PICKET AGAIN THEY WERE ARRESTED NO ONE WHO SAW THAT LINE WILL EVER FORGET THE IMPRESSION IT MADE NOT ONLY ON FRIENDS OF THE SUFFRAGISTS
3259-158083-0023 BUT ON THE GENERAL POPULACE OF WASHINGTON TO SEE THESE WOMEN FORCE WITH SUCH MAGNIFICENT DEFIANCE THE HAND OF A WAVERING ADMINISTRATION ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING
3259-158083-0025 AT THIS SUGGESTION TINY MISSUS NOLAN PULLED HERSELF UP ON HER TOES AND SAID WITH GREAT DIGNITY

3259-158083-0035 THE DOOR WAS BARRED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
3259-158083-0037 WHEN MISSUS LEWIS DOUBLED OVER AND HANDLED LIKE A SACK OF SOMETHING
3259-158083-0038 AND ONLY HALF CONSCIOUS UNTIL MORNING
3259-158083-0040 THEY TOOK ME TO MISTER WHITTAKER'S OFFICE
3259-158083-0041 YOU'RE MISSUS MARY NOLAN SAID WHITTAKER

3259-158083-0074 EACH ONE WAS CALLED TO THE MAT AND INTERROGATED WILL YOU WORK WILL YOU PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WILL YOU EAT WILL YOU STOP PICKETING WILL YOU GO WITHOUT PAYING YOUR FINE AND PROMISE NEVER TO PICKET AGAIN
3259-158083-0076 WAS THE UNEXPECTED SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING OF ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT DOCTORS
3259-158083-0077 I HAVE SEEN WOMEN IN RUSSIA UNDERGO EXTREME SUFFERING FOR THEIR IDEALS BUT UNLESS I HAD SEEN THIS WITH MY OWN EYES
3259-158083-0079 YOU GIRLS ARE ON YOUR NINTH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE AND YOUR CONDITION IS CRITICAL IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SUCH WOMEN SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO THIS TREATMENT I HOPE THAT YOU WILL CARRY YOUR POINT
3259-158083-0080 AND FORCE THE HAND OF THE GOVERNMENT
3259-158083-0082 THE STORIES OF THE INHUMAN TREATMENT AT OCCOQUAN WERE FALSE AND THAT SHE MUST NOT BELIEVE THEM FINALLY MISSUS YOUNG PLEADED TO BE ALLOWED TO SEND ADDITIONAL WARM CLOTHING TO HER DAUGHTER WHOM SHE KNEW TO BE TOO LIGHTLY CLAD FOR THE VIGOROUS TEMPERATURE OF NOVEMBER
3259-158083-0083 MISTER TUMULTY ASSURED HER THAT THE WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CLOTHED AND REFUSED TO PERMIT THE CLOTHING TO BE SENT THE SUBSEQUENT STORIES OF THE WOMEN SHOWED WHAT AGONIES THEY HAD ENDURED BECAUSE THEY WERE INADEQUATELY CLAD FROM THE DAMPNESS OF THE CELLS INTO WHICH THEY WERE THROWN
3259-158083-0085 OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN MISSUS BRANNAN LIFE LONG SUFFRAGIST IS AN ARISTOCRAT OF INTELLECT AND FEELING WHO HAS ALWAYS ALLIED HERSELF WITH LIBERTARIAN MOVEMENTS THIS WAS HER SECOND TERM OF IMPRISONMENT
3259-158083-0086 SHE WROTE A COMPREHENSIVE AFFIDAVIT OF HER EXPERIENCE AFTER NARRATING THE EVENTS WHICH LED UP TO THE ATTACK SHE CONTINUES SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER THEN SHOUTED OUT IN A LOUD TONE OF VOICE
3259-158083-0088 BY THE ARMS TWIST OR FORCE THEM BACK OF HER
3259-158083-0089 AND PUT IT ON IN ORDER TO PREPARE MYSELF IF ATTACKED I WAS TREMBLING AT THE TIME AND WAS STUNNED WITH TERROR AT THE SITUATION AS IT HAD DEVELOPED AND SAID TO THE SUPERINTENDENT I WILL GIVE MY NAME UNDER PROTEST AND STARTED TO WALK TOWARDS THE DESK WHEREON LAY THE BOOKS THE SUPERINTENDENT SHOUTED TO ME
3259-158083-0091 I SAW MISS LINCOLN LYING ON THE FLOOR WITH EVERY APPEARANCE OF HAVING JUST BEEN THROWN DOWN BY THE TWO GUARDS WHO WERE STANDING OVER HER IN A MENACING ATTITUDE SEEING THE GENERAL DISTURBANCE
3259-158083-0092 I GAVE UP ALL IDEA OF GIVING MY NAME AT THE DESK AND INSTINCTIVELY JOINED MY COMPANIONS TO GO WITH THEM AND SHARE WHATEVER WAS IN STORE FOR THEM THE WHOLE GROUP OF WOMEN WERE THROWN DRAGGED OR HERDED OUT OF THE OFFICE ON TO THE PORCH DOWN THE STEPS TO THE GROUND AND FORCED TO CROSS THE ROAD
3259-158083-0094 AND ONE CHAIR WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED DURING THE TIME THAT WE WERE BEING FORCED INTO THE CELLS THE GUARDS KEPT UP AN UPROAR SHOUTING BANGING THE IRON DOORS CLANGING BARS MAKING A TERRIFYING NOISE
3259-158083-0095 I AND ONE OF MY COMPANIONS WERE LYING DOWN ON THE NARROW BED ON WHICH WERE A BLANKET AND ONE PILLOW THE DOOR OF THE CELL WAS OPENED AND A MATTRESS AND A BLANKET BEING THROWN IN THE DOOR WAS VIOLENTLY BANGED TO
3259-158083-0097 GAG YOU AND PUT YOU IN A STRAITJACKET I WISH TO STATE AGAIN THAT THE CELLS INTO WHICH WE WERE PUT WERE SITUATED IN THE MEN'S PRISON
3259-158083-0098 AND WHO COULD AT ANY MOMENT LOOK AT US FURTHERMORE THE WATER CLOSETS WERE IN FULL VIEW OF THE CORRIDOR WHERE SUPERINTENDENT WHITTAKER AND THE GUARDS WERE MOVING ABOUT THE FLUSHING OF THESE CLOSETS COULD ONLY BE DONE FROM THE CORRIDOR AND WE WERE FORCED TO ASK THE GUARDS TO DO THIS FOR US
3259-158083-0100 I WAS EXHAUSTED BY WHAT I HAD SEEN AND BEEN THROUGH AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN ABSOLUTE TERROR OF FURTHER ATTACK AND OF WHAT MIGHT STILL BE IN STORE FOR US I THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG GIRLS WHO WERE WITH US AND FEARED FOR THEIR SAFETY THE GUARDS ACTED BRUTAL IN THE EXTREME
3259-158083-0101 INCITED TO THEIR BRUTAL CONDUCT TOWARDS US BY THE SUPERINTENDENT I THOUGHT OF THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE HAD BEEN CHARGED MERELY THAT OF OBSTRUCTING TRAFFIC AND FELT THAT THE TREATMENT THAT WE HAD RECEIVED WAS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THE OFFENSE WITH WHICH WE WERE CHARGED
3259-158083-0103 LEST THE EXTREME OF OUTRAGE WOULD BE WORKED UPON THE YOUNG GIRLS OF OUR PARTY BECAME INTENSE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE TERROR OF THAT NIGHT
3259-158083-0104 THE AFFIDAVIT THEN CONTINUES WITH THE STORY OF HOW MISSUS BRANNAN WAS COMPELLED THE FOLLOWING MORNING TO PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES WAS GIVEN A CUP OF SKIMMED MILK AND A SLICE OF TOAST
3259-158083-0106 SEVEN OF US BEING IN THE PARTY WE WERE SO EXHAUSTED AND WEARY THAT WE WERE OBLIGED TO STOP CONSTANTLY TO REST ON OUR WAY BACK FROM THE WALK WE HEARD THE BAYING OF HOUNDS VERY NEAR US IN THE WOODS THE MATRON SAID
3259-158083-0107 ONE OF THE PARTY MISS FINDEISEN ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD ATTACK US TO WHICH THE MATRON REPLIED THAT IS JUST WHAT THEY WOULD DO AND HURRIED US ALONG THE BAYING GREW LOUDER AND NEARER AT TIMES AND THEN MORE DISTANT AS THE DOGS RUSHED BACK AND FORTH
3259-158083-0109 THEY WERE TOLD THAT NO EFFORTS WERE BEING MADE FROM THE OUTSIDE TO REACH THEM AND THAT THEIR ATTORNEY HAD BEEN CALLED OFF THE CASE EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE HUNGER STRIKING EACH ONE WAS TOLD THAT ALL THE OTHERS HAD PUT ON PRISON CLOTHES AND WERE WORKING
3259-158083-0110 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER THEY SUSPECTED THE LIES AND REMAINED STRONG IN THEIR RESISTANCE AFTER MISTER O'BRIEN'S ONE VISIT AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS IN THE PRESS HE WAS THEREAFTER REFUSED ADMISSION TO THE WORKHOUSE
3259-158083-0112 WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE ONLY COURSE OPEN TO OBTAIN A WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS A HURRIED JOURNEY BY COUNSEL TO UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE WADDILL OF NORFOLK VIRGINIA BROUGHT THE WRIT
3259-158083-0113 IT COMPELLED THE GOVERNMENT TO BRING THE PRISONERS INTO COURT AND SHOW CAUSE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE RETURNED TO THE DISTRICT JAIL THIS CONSERVATIVE SOUTHERN JUDGE SAID OF THE PETITION FOR THE WRIT
3259-158083-0115 A DETECTIVE SUDDENLY APPEARED TO ACCOMPANY MISTER O'BRIEN FROM WASHINGTON TO NORFOLK DURING HIS STAY IN NORFOLK AND BACK TO WASHINGTON TELEPHONE WIRES AT OUR HEADQUARTERS WERE TAPPED IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WAS COGNIZANT OF EVERY MOVE IN THIS PROCEDURE BEFORE IT WAS EXECUTED
3259-158083-0116 NO SOONER WAS OUR PLAN DECIDED UPON THAN FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION BESOUGHT US TO ABANDON THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS ONE MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION SENT AN EMISSARY TO OUR HEADQUARTERS WITH THE FOLLOWING APPEAL
3259-158083-0118 AND BEFORE THE END OF THE WEEK THEY HOPED TO INCREASE THEIR FACILITIES FOR FORCIBLE FEEDING AT THE WORKHOUSE THEY ALSO WISHED TO CONCEAL THE TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN THE EXPOSURE OF WHICH WOULD BE INEVITABLE IN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS AND LASTLY
3259-158083-0119 THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID OPENING UP THE WHOLE QUESTION OF THE LEGALITY OF THE VERY EXISTENCE OF THE WORKHOUSE IN VIRGINIA PERSONS CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT FOR ACTS COMMITTED IN VIOLATION OF DISTRICT LAW WERE TRANSPORTED TO VIRGINIA ALIEN TERRITORY TO SERVE THEIR TERMS
3259-158083-0121 SHOULD BE EXECUTED IN THE DISTRICT HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND WHO HAD SERVED THEIR SENTENCES IN VIRGINIA HAD BEEN WITHOUT MONEY OR INFLUENCE ENOUGH TO CONTEST THIS DOUBTFUL PROCEDURE IN THE COURTS THE ADMINISTRATION
3259-158083-0122 WAS ALARMED WE QUICKENED OUR PACE A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATION RUSHED HIS ATTORNEY AS COURIER TO THE WOMEN IN THE WORKHOUSE TO IMPLORE THEM NOT TO CONSENT TO THE HABEAS CORPUS PROCEEDINGS HE WAS EASILY ADMITTED AND TRIED TO EXTORT FROM ONE PRISONER AT A TIME A PROMISE TO REJECT THE PLAN
3259-158083-0124 A DEPUTY MARSHAL MUST SERVE THE WRIT COUNSEL SOUGHT A DEPUTY FOR MILES AROUND WASHINGTON NOT ONE WAS TO BE FOUND AT HIS HOME OR LODGINGS NONE COULD BE REACHED BY TELEPHONE
3259-158083-0125 WHERE HE KEPT HIMSELF DISCREETLY HIDDEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS WHEN A DEPUTY WAS FOUND SIX ATTEMPTS WERE MADE TO SERVE THE WRIT ALL FAILED FINALLY BY A RUSE MISTER WHITTAKER WAS CAUGHT AT HIS HOME LATE AT NIGHT
3374-298025-0001 BUT WHAT SHALL MY SPIRIT BESTOW UPON ITS OFFSPRING WHICH LIKE ITS PARENT IS AS POOR IN POESY AS IT IS RICH IN LOVE JUST ONE WORD A PARTING TROPE
3374-298025-0002 IT IS NOT ALONE THE ROYAL EAGLE WHO MAY DESPISE THE CROAKING OF THE RAVEN THE SWAN TOO IS PROUD AND TAKES NO NOTE OF IT
3374-298025-0004 A FRESH WARM BREATH OF LIFE AND LOVE FANNED ME RUSTLING AND STIRRING IN ALL THE BRANCHES OF THE VERDANT GROVE I GAZED AND ENJOYED IT ALL THE RICH GREEN THE WHITE BLOSSOMS AND THE GOLDEN FRUIT
3374-298025-0005 AND IN MY MIND'S EYE I SAW TOO IN MANY FORMS MY ONE AND ONLY BELOVED NOW AS A LITTLE GIRL NOW AS A YOUNG LADY IN THE FULL BLOOM AND ENERGY OF LOVE AND WOMANHOOD
3374-298025-0007 FROM THIS FEELING OR THOUGHT NOTHING COULD HAVE TURNED ME NEITHER GENERAL DESPAIR NOR PERSONAL FEAR FOR I BELIEVED
3374-298025-0008 BUT I GLADLY LOST MYSELF IN ALL THOSE BLENDINGS AND INTERTWININGS OF JOY AND PAIN FROM WHICH SPRING THE SPICE OF LIFE AND THE FLOWER OF FEELING SPIRITUAL PLEASURE AS WELL AS SENSUAL BLISS
3374-298025-0010 IT WAS NOT ONLY THE WISH TO RELIEVE THE TORMENTING STING OF MY DESIRE AND TO COOL THE SWEET FIRE BY GRATIFICATION IT WAS NOT FOR YOUR LIPS THAT I LONGED OR FOR YOUR EYES OR FOR YOUR BODY
3374-298025-0011 A MARVELOUS MINGLING OF MEMORIES AND DESIRES ALL THE MYSTERIES OF CAPRICE IN MAN AND WOMAN SEEMED TO HOVER ABOUT ME WHEN SUDDENLY IN MY SOLITUDE
3374-298025-0013 THE ENJOYMENT YOU ARE SO EXTRAORDINARILY CLEVER DEAREST LUCINDA THAT YOU HAVE DOUBTLESS LONG ERE THIS BEGUN TO SUSPECT THAT THIS IS ALL NOTHING BUT A BEAUTIFUL DREAM
3374-298025-0014 NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW HOW LONG I DO NOT KNOW FOR ALONG WITH THE OTHER RULES OF REASON AND MORALITY I COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT THE LAPSE OF TIME WELL I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND LOOKING OUT INTO THE OPEN
3374-298025-0016 SO THE CALM BROAD SILVERY RIVER WINDS ALONG IN GREAT BENDS AND SWEEPS UNTIL IT AND THE LOVER'S FANTASY CRADLED UPON IT LIKE THE SWAN PASS AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE AND LOSE THEMSELVES IN THE IMMEASURABLE
3374-298025-0017 MY VISION DOUBTLESS OWES THE GROVE AND ITS SOUTHERN COLOR EFFECT TO THE HUGE MASS OF FLOWERS HERE BESIDE ME
3374-298025-0019 ALL EXCEPT THAT NOT LONG AGO I WAS STANDING BY THE WINDOW AND DOING NOTHING AND THAT I AM NOW SITTING HERE AND DOING SOMETHING SOMETHING WHICH IS PERHAPS LITTLE MORE THAN NOTHING PERHAPS EVEN LESS
3374-298025-0020 I WAS JUST ON THE POINT OF UNFOLDING TO YOU IN CLEAR AND PRECISE PERIODS THE EXACT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HISTORY OF OUR FRIVOLITIES AND OF MY DULNESS I WAS GOING TO EXPOUND TO YOU STEP BY STEP
3374-298025-0022 I WAS ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE APPRENTICESHIP OF MY MANHOOD
3374-298025-0023 A PERIOD WHICH TAKEN AS A WHOLE OR IN PARTS I CAN NEVER LOOK BACK UPON WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INWARD AMUSEMENT A LITTLE MELANCHOLY AND CONSIDERABLE SELF SATISFACTION
3374-298025-0025 THERE IS NO BETTER ADAPTATION OF MEANS TO ENDS THAN THIS NAMELY THAT RIGHT AT THE START I BEGIN BY ABOLISHING WHAT WE CALL ORDERLY ARRANGEMENT KEEP MYSELF ENTIRELY ALOOF FROM IT
3374-298025-0026 FRANKLY CLAIMING AND ASSERTING THE RIGHT TO A CHARMING CONFUSION THIS IS ALL THE MORE NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE MATERIAL WHICH OUR LIFE AND LOVE OFFERS TO MY SPIRIT AND TO MY PEN IS SO INCESSANTLY PROGRESSIVE
3374-298025-0028 SO I USE MY INCONTESTABLE RIGHT TO A CONFUSED STYLE BY INSERTING HERE IN THE WRONG PLACE ONE OF THE MANY INCOHERENT SHEETS WHICH I ONCE FILLED WITH RUBBISH
3374-298025-0029 IT WAS WRITTEN IN A MOOD OF IMPATIENT LONGING DUE TO MY NOT FINDING YOU WHERE I MOST SURELY EXPECTED TO FIND YOU IN YOUR ROOM ON OUR SOFA IN THE HAPHAZARD WORDS SUGGESTED BY THE PEN YOU HAD LATELY BEEN USING
3374-298025-0031 IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AND HAS A CERTAIN SORT OF RESEMBLANCE TO WHAT THEY CALL THOUGHT I CHOOSE IN PREFERENCE TO ANYTHING ELSE A DITHYRAMBIC FANTASY ON THE MOST LOVELY OF SITUATIONS
3374-298025-0032 FOR ONCE WE KNOW TO A CERTAINTY THAT WE LIVE IN A MOST BEAUTIFUL WORLD THE NEXT NEED IS OBVIOUS
3374-298026-0001 THE HOLIEST AND MOST EVANESCENT OF THOSE DELICATE TRAITS AND UTTERANCES OF THE SOUL WHICH TO ONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW THE HIGHEST SEEM LIKE BLISS ITSELF
3374-298026-0002 ARE MERELY THE COMMON ATMOSPHERE OF OUR SPIRITUAL BREATH AND LIFE THE WORDS ARE WEAK AND VAGUE
3374-298026-0004 EACH IDEA DEVELOPS A COUNTLESS PROGENY
3374-298026-0005 I REMEMBER EVERYTHING EVEN THE GRIEFS AND ALL MY THOUGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE TO BE
3374-298026-0007 WHICH MIGHT AT LAST GRATIFY MY DESIRE AND GIVE IT REST AND THEN AGAIN I SUDDENLY AND SADLY BETHINK ME OF THE GLOOMY TIME WHEN I WAS ALWAYS WAITING WITHOUT HOPE
3374-298026-0008 AND MADLY LOVING WITHOUT KNOWING IT WHEN MY INNERMOST BEING OVERFLOWED WITH A VAGUE LONGING WHICH IT BREATHED FORTH BUT RARELY IN HALF SUPPRESSED SIGHS
3374-298026-0010 A PERFECT FRIEND FOR IT WAS IN FRIENDSHIP ESPECIALLY THAT I SOUGHT FOR WHAT I WANTED AND FOR WHAT I NEVER HOPED TO FIND IN ANY WOMAN IN YOU I FOUND IT ALL AND MORE THAN I COULD WISH FOR
3374-298026-0011 YOU KNOW NOTHING THE WOMANLINESS OF YOUR SOUL ASIDE FROM MINOR PECULIARITIES CONSISTS IN ITS REGARDING LIFE AND LOVE AS THE SAME THING FOR YOU ALL FEELING IS INFINITE AND ETERNAL
3374-298026-0013 THAT IS WHY YOU LOVE ME ALL OF ME AND WILL SURRENDER NO PART OF ME TO THE STATE TO POSTERITY OR TO MANLY PLEASURES I AM ALL YOURS WE ARE CLOSEST TO EACH OTHER
3374-298026-0014 AND WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER YOU ACCOMPANY ME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES OF MANHOOD FROM THE UTMOST WANTONNESS TO THE MOST REFINED SPIRITUALITY IN YOU ALONE I FIRST SAW TRUE PRIDE
3374-298026-0016 WOULD SEEM TO ME NOTHING BUT A CHARMING ANTITHESIS TO THE SUBLIME FRIVOLITY OF OUR MARRIAGE WHY SHOULD WE NOT TAKE THE HARSHEST WHIM OF CHANCE FOR AN EXCELLENT JEST AND A MOST FROLICSOME CAPRICE SINCE WE
3374-298026-0017 LIKE OUR LOVE ARE IMMORTAL I CAN NO LONGER SAY MY LOVE AND YOUR LOVE THEY ARE BOTH ALIKE IN THEIR PERFECT MUTUALITY MARRIAGE IS THE EVERLASTING UNITY AND ALLIANCE OF OUR SPIRITS
3374-298026-0019 AND SO I SAY AGAIN LET US LIVE AND LOVE I KNOW YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO SURVIVE ME YOU WOULD RATHER FOLLOW YOUR DYING HUSBAND INTO HIS COFFIN GLADLY AND LOVINGLY WOULD YOU DESCEND INTO THE BURNING ABYSS
3374-298026-0020 EVEN AS THE WOMEN OF INDIA DO IMPELLED BY A MAD LAW THE CRUEL CONSTRAINING PURPOSE OF WHICH DESECRATES AND DESTROYS THE MOST DELICATE SANCTITIES OF THE WILL
3374-298026-0022 SEEMS TO BE COMPLETE IN ITSELF AS SINGLE AND INDIVISIBLE AS A PERSON ONE THING CROWDS OUT ANOTHER AND THAT WHICH JUST NOW WAS NEAR AND PRESENT SOON SINKS BACK INTO OBSCURITY
3374-298026-0023 AND THEN AGAIN COME MOMENTS OF SUDDEN AND UNIVERSAL CLARITY WHEN SEVERAL SUCH SPIRITS OF THE INNER WORLD COMPLETELY FUSE TOGETHER INTO A WONDERFUL WEDLOCK AND MANY A FORGOTTEN BIT OF OUR EGO SHINES FORTH IN A NEW LIGHT
3374-298026-0025 I THINK IN A LARGE WAY THAT WHICH WE CALL A LIFE IS FOR THE COMPLETE INNER IMMORTAL MAN ONLY A SINGLE IDEA AN INDIVISIBLE FEELING
3374-298026-0026 AND FOR HIM THERE COME TOO MOMENTS OF THE PROFOUNDEST AND FULLEST CONSCIOUSNESS WHEN ALL LIVES FALL TOGETHER AND MINGLE AND SEPARATE IN A DIFFERENT WAY
3374-298026-0028 THAT WHAT WE NOW CALL MERELY HOPE WAS REALLY MEMORY DO YOU KNOW HOW THE FIRST SEED OF THIS IDEA GERMINATED IN MY SOUL BEFORE YOU AND TOOK ROOT IN YOURS
3374-298026-0029 WEAVE OUR LOVE EVER AND EVER MORE CLOSELY AND FIRMLY TOGETHER JUST AS A CHILD LIKE AN ECHO DOUBLES THE HAPPINESS OF ITS GENTLE PARENTS NOTHING CAN PART US
3374-298026-0031 I TRIED TO CALM MYSELF AND IN A SORT OF BEWILDERMENT I WOULD NOT BELIEVE THAT I WAS SEPARATED FROM YOU UNTIL THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS CONVINCED ME OF IT AGAINST MY WILL
3374-298026-0032 BUT THEN MY LONGING GREW AGAIN IRRESISTIBLE UNTIL ON ITS WINGS I SANK BACK INTO YOUR ARMS SUPPOSE WORDS OR A HUMAN BEING TO CREATE A MISUNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US
3374-298026-0034 WE HAVE TO COOL AND MITIGATE THE CONSUMING FIRE WITH JESTS AND THUS FOR US THE MOST WITTY OF THE FORMS AND SITUATIONS OF JOY IS ALSO THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
3374-298026-0035 IT IS NOT MERELY THE DELIGHT OF EXHAUSTION OR THE ANTICIPATION OF REVENGE I SEE IN IT A WONDERFUL AND PROFOUNDLY SIGNIFICANT ALLEGORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAN AND WOMAN
3374-298026-0037 AND HOW YOU TOOK IT AT THAT TIME AND I THINK I KNOW JUST AS WELL WHAT YOU WILL THINK OF IT AND HOW YOU WILL TAKE IT HERE HERE IN THIS LITTLE BOOK IN WHICH YOU EXPECT TO FIND GENUINE HISTORY PLAIN TRUTH AND CALM REASON
3374-298026-0038 YES EVEN MORALITY THE CHARMING MORALITY OF LOVE
3374-298026-0040 I REPLIED
3374-298026-0041 A MAN FEELS IT HE MUST WISH TO TALK ABOUT IT AND WHAT A MAN WISHES TO TALK ABOUT HE MAY WRITE
3374-298026-0043 AND SOMETIMES FALLS HEADLONG OVER ITS OWN HONEST ZEAL AND SPEAKS A WORD THAT IS DIVINE TO THE POINT OF COARSENESS THIS APOLOGY WOULD INDEED SAVE ME
3374-298026-0044 BUT PERHAPS ONLY AT THE ENORMOUS EXPENSE OF MY MANHOOD ITSELF FOR WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK OF MY MANHOOD IN PARTICULAR YOU HAVE NEVERTHELESS A GREAT DEAL AGAINST THE SEX IN GENERAL
3374-298026-0046 SINCE SHE TOO IS A LADY WHOM I LOVE MOST TENDERLY
3374-298032-0000 THE CHILDREN ARE JUSTIFIED WHEN THEY PEEP SO CURIOUSLY AND TIMIDLY AT A COMPANY OF UNKNOWN FACES EACH INDIVIDUAL ATOM OF EVERLASTING TIME IS CAPABLE OF COMPRISING A WORLD OF JOY
3374-298032-0002 I UNDERSTAND NOW THE OLD FAIRY TALE ABOUT THE MAN WHOM THE SORCERER ALLOWED TO LIVE A GREAT MANY YEARS IN A FEW MOMENTS FOR I KNOW BY MY OWN EXPERIENCE THE TERRIBLE OMNIPOTENCE OF THE FANTASY
3374-298032-0003 SINCE THE LAST LETTER FROM YOUR SISTER IT IS THREE DAYS NOW I HAVE UNDERGONE THE SUFFERINGS OF AN ENTIRE LIFE FROM THE BRIGHT SUNLIGHT OF GLOWING YOUTH TO THE PALE MOONLIGHT OF SAGACIOUS OLD AGE
3374-298032-0005 INDEED NO LONGER DANGEROUS BUT DECIDED PAST HOPE LOST IN THIS THOUGHT AND MY STRENGTH ENTIRELY EXHAUSTED ON ACCOUNT OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF HURRYING TO YOUR SIDE
3374-298032-0006 MY STATE OF MIND WAS REALLY VERY DISCONSOLATE NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I UNDERSTAND WHAT IT REALLY WAS BEING NEW BORN BY THE JOYFUL NEWS THAT YOU ARE WELL AGAIN
3374-298032-0008 FLOWERS HAD STARTED TO GROW ON THE BELOVED GRAVE AND MY TEARS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO FLOW MORE GENTLY MUTE AND ALONE I STOOD AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE FEATURES I HAD LOVED AND THE SWEET GLANCES OF THE EXPRESSIVE EYES
3374-298032-0009 NOW AND THEN THE PALE FACE SMILED AND SEEMED ASLEEP JUST AS IT HAD LOOKED THE LAST TIME I SAW IT THEN OF A SUDDEN THE DIFFERENT MEMORIES ALL BECAME CONFUSED
3374-298032-0011 ONLY YOUR HOLY EYES REMAINED IN THE EMPTY SPACE AND HUNG THERE MOTIONLESS EVEN AS THE FRIENDLY STARS SHINE ETERNALLY OVER OUR POVERTY
3374-298032-0012 NOW A PIERCING PAIN FROM DARK SUNS BURNED ME WITH AN INSUPPORTABLE GLARE NOW A BEAUTIFUL RADIANCE HOVERED ABOUT AS IF TO ENTICE ME THEN I SEEMED TO FEEL A FRESH BREATH OF MORNING AIR FAN ME
3374-298032-0014 WHY SHOULD YOU TORMENT YOURSELF IN A FEW MINUTES YOU CAN BE WITH HER
3374-298032-0015 I WAS ALREADY HASTENING TO YOU WHEN SUDDENLY A NEW THOUGHT HELD ME BACK AND I SAID TO MY SPIRIT
3374-298032-0017 AND THEN PRESENT YOURSELF AGAIN WHEN YOUR ORDERS HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
3374-298032-0018 IS IT NOT TO YOU ALSO REMARKABLE HOW EVERYTHING ON THIS EARTH MOVES TOWARD THE CENTRE HOW ORDERLY EVERYTHING IS HOW INSIGNIFICANT AND TRIVIAL SO IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME
3374-298032-0020 AS WHEN A PERSON SUDDENLY FINDS HIMSELF ALONE IN THE MIDST OF IMMEASURABLE MOUNTAINS OF ICE EVERYTHING ABOUT ME AND IN ME WAS COLD AND STRANGE AND EVEN MY TEARS FROZE
3374-298032-0021 WONDERFUL WORLDS APPEARED AND VANISHED BEFORE ME IN MY UNEASY DREAM I WAS SICK AND SUFFERED GREAT PAIN BUT I LOVED MY SICKNESS AND WELCOMED THE SUFFERING
3374-298032-0023 AND AS A DELICATE SPIRIT OFTEN GROWS MELANCHOLY IN THE VERY LAP OF HAPPINESS OVER ITS OWN JOY AND AT THE VERY ACME OF ITS EXISTENCE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF THE FUTILITY OF IT ALL
3374-298032-0024 SO DID I REGARD MY SUFFERING WITH MYSTERIOUS PLEASURE I REGARDED IT AS THE SYMBOL OF LIFE IN GENERAL I BELIEVED THAT I WAS SEEING AND FEELING THE EVERLASTING DISCORD
3374-298032-0026 EVEN INTO THE MOST HIDDEN DEPTHS OF EXISTENCE ON ACCOUNT OF THIS REMARKABLE FEELING SICKNESS ACQUIRED THE CHARACTER OF A PECULIAR WORLD COMPLETE IN ITSELF
3374-298032-0027 I FELT THAT ITS MYSTERIOUS LIFE WAS RICHER AND DEEPER THAN THE VULGAR HEALTH OF THE DREAMING SLEEP WALKERS ALL AROUND ME AND WITH THE SICKLINESS WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL UNPLEASANT
3374-298032-0029 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT ALL WAS RIGHT SO AND THAT YOUR UNAVOIDABLE DEATH WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A GENTLE AWAKENING AFTER A LIGHT SLEEP I TOO THOUGHT THAT I WAS AWAKE WHEN I SAW YOUR PICTURE
3374-298032-0030 WHICH EVERMORE TRANSFIGURED ITSELF INTO A CHEERFUL DIFFUSED PURITY SERIOUS AND YET CHARMING QUITE YOU AND YET NO LONGER YOU THE DIVINE FORM IRRADIATED BY A WONDERFUL LIGHT
3374-298032-0032 BECAUSE EVERY EARTHLY SENTIMENT WAS ENTIRELY STRANGE TO ME AND THE FEELING NEVER LEFT ME THAT I WAS CONSECRATED TO DEATH
3374-298032-0033 THE YEARS PASSED SLOWLY BY AND DEEDS AND WORKS ADVANCED LABORIOUSLY TO THEIR GOAL ONE AFTER THE OTHER A GOAL THAT SEEMED AS LITTLE MINE AS THE DEEDS AND WORKS SEEMED TO BE WHAT THEY ARE CALLED
3374-298032-0035 AND THE ONE ETERNAL AND INDIVISIBLE HUMANITY ALL EXISTENCE WAS AN UNINTERRUPTED DIVINE SERVICE OF SOLITARY LOVE
3374-298032-0036 FINALLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS THAT IT WAS NOW NEARLY OVER THE BROW WAS NO LONGER SMOOTH AND THE LOCKS WERE BECOMING GRAY MY CAREER WAS ENDED BUT NOT COMPLETED
3374-298032-0038 STOOD EVER UNATTAINABLE BEFORE ME I SHOULD HAVE DESPAIRED HAD I NOT PERCEIVED AND IDOLIZED BOTH IN YOU GRACIOUS MADONNA AND YOU AND YOUR GENTLE GODLINESS IN MYSELF
3374-298032-0039 THEN YOU APPEARED TO ME BECKONING WITH THE SUMMONS OF DEATH
3374-298032-0041 AND ONLY IN THAT WAY DOES A HUMAN BEING BECOME ONE AND A COMPLETE ENTITY THAT IS BY REGARDING AND POETICALLY CONCEIVING HIMSELF AS THE CENTRE OF EVERYTHING AND THE SPIRIT OF THE WORLD
3374-298032-0042 BUT WHY POETICALLY CONCEIVE SINCE WE FIND THE GERM OF EVERYTHING IN OURSELVES AND YET REMAIN FOREVER ONLY A FRAGMENT OF OURSELVES
3436-172162-0001 AND I WARN YOU THAT THERE BE NONE OF YOU BUT HE BE WELL HORSED AND THAT YE ALL BE CLOTHED IN GREEN EITHER SILK OR CLOTH AND I SHALL BRING WITH ME TEN LADIES AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A LADY BEHIND HIM
3436-172162-0002 AND EVERY KNIGHT SHALL HAVE A SQUIRE AND TWO YEOMAN AND ALL WELL HORSED FOR THUS IT CHANCED ONE MORN WHEN ALL THE COURT GREEN SUITED BUT WITH PLUMES THAT MOCK'D THE MAY HAD BEEN THEIR WONT A MAYING
3436-172162-0004 SIR DODYNAS LE SAUVAGE SIR OZANNA SIR LADYNAS SIR PERSANT OF INDE SIR IRONSIDE AND SIR PELLEAS AND THESE TEN KNIGHTS MADE THEM READY
3436-172162-0005 SO UPON THE MORN THEY TOOK THEIR HORSES WITH THE QUEEN AND RODE A MAYING IN WOODS AND MEADOWS AS IT PLEASED THEM IN GREAT JOY AND DELIGHT NOW THERE WAS A KNIGHT
3436-172162-0007 BUT THE TEN NOBLE KNIGHTS ALL ARRAYED IN GREEN FOR MAYING SO HE PREPARED HIM TWENTY MEN OF ARMS AND A HUNDRED ARCHERS TO TAKE CAPTIVE THE QUEEN AND HER KNIGHTS
3436-172162-0008 IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY IN A MORN AT BREAK OF DAY WITH A TROOP OF DAMSELS PLAYING THE QUEEN FORSOOTH WENT FORTH A MAYING OLD SONG SO WHEN THE QUEEN HAD MAYED
3436-172162-0010 BE IT AS IT MAY SAID SIR MALEAGANS KNOW YOU WELL MADAM I HAVE LOVED YOU MANY A YEAR AND NEVER TILL NOW COULD I GET YOU TO SUCH ADVANTAGE AS I DO NOW AND THEREFORE I WILL TAKE YOU AS I FIND YOU
3436-172162-0011 THEN THE TEN KNIGHTS OF THE ROUND TABLE DREW THEIR SWORDS AND THE OTHER PARTY RUN AT THEM WITH THEIR SPEARS
3436-172162-0013 SLAY NOT MY NOBLE KNIGHTS AND I WILL GO WITH YOU UPON THIS COVENANT THAT
3436-172162-0014 MADAME SAID MALEAGANS FOR YOUR SAKE THEY SHALL BE LED WITH YOU INTO MY OWN CASTLE IF THAT YE WILL BE RULED AND RIDE WITH ME THEN SIR MALEAGANS CHARGED THEM ALL THAT NONE SHOULD DEPART FROM THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0016 AND BEAR THIS RING UNTO SIR LAUNCELOT AND PRAY HIM AS HE LOVETH ME THAT HE WILL SEE ME AND RESCUE ME AND SPARE NOT THY HORSE SAID THE QUEEN NEITHER FOR WATER NOR FOR LAND
3436-172162-0017 AND LIGHTLY HE TOOK HIS HORSE WITH THE SPURS AND DEPARTED AS FAST AS HE MIGHT AND WHEN SIR MALEAGANS SAW HIM SO FLEE HE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS BY THE QUEEN'S COMMANDMENT FOR TO WARN SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0019 THEN HE RODE WITH HER AND THEM ALL TO HIS CASTLE IN ALL THE HASTE THAT THEY MIGHT AND BY THE WAY SIR MALEAGANS LAID IN AMBUSH THE BEST ARCHERS THAT HE HAD TO WAIT FOR SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0020 AND THE CHILD CAME TO WESTMINSTER AND FOUND SIR LAUNCELOT AND TOLD HIS MESSAGE AND DELIVERED HIM THE QUEEN'S RING ALAS SAID SIR LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0022 AND MEN SAY HE TOOK THE WATER AT WESTMINSTER BRIDGE AND MADE HIS HORSE SWIM OVER THAMES UNTO LAMBETH THEN WITHIN A WHILE HE CAME TO A WOOD WHERE WAS A NARROW WAY AND THERE THE ARCHERS WERE LAID IN AMBUSH
3436-172162-0023 AND THEY SHOT AT HIM AND SMOTE HIS HORSE SO THAT HE FELL THEN SIR LAUNCELOT LEFT HIS HORSE AND WENT ON FOOT BUT THERE LAY SO MANY DITCHES AND HEDGES BETWIXT THE ARCHERS AND HIM THAT HE MIGHT NOT MEDDLE WITH THEM
3436-172162-0025 THEN SIR LAUNCELOT WENT AWHILE AND HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY CUMBERED BY HIS ARMOR HIS SHIELD AND HIS SPEAR AND ALL THAT BELONGED TO HIM THEN BY CHANCE THERE CAME BY HIM A CART THAT CAME THITHER TO FETCH WOOD
3436-172162-0026 CARTS WERE LITTLE USED EXCEPT FOR CARRYING OFFAL AND FOR CONVEYING CRIMINALS TO EXECUTION BUT SIR LAUNCELOT TOOK NO THOUGHT OF ANYTHING BUT THE NECESSITY OF HASTE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESCUING THE QUEEN SO HE DEMANDED OF THE CARTER
3436-172162-0028 HE DREW NEAR TO SEE WHO IT MIGHT BE THEN SIR LAUNCELOT TOLD HIM HOW THE QUEEN HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF AND HOW IN HASTENING TO HER RESCUE HIS HORSE HAD BEEN DISABLED AND HE HAD BEEN COMPELLED TO AVAIL HIMSELF OF THE CART RATHER THAN GIVE UP HIS ENTERPRISE
3436-172162-0029 THEN SIR GAWAIN SAID SURELY IT IS UNWORTHY OF A KNIGHT TO TRAVEL IN SUCH SORT BUT SIR LAUNCELOT HEEDED HIM NOT AT NIGHTFALL
3436-172162-0031 AT SUPPER SIR LAUNCELOT CAME NEAR BEING CONSIGNED TO THE KITCHEN
3436-172162-0032 NEITHER WOULD THE DAMSELS PREPARE A BED FOR HIM HE SEIZED THE FIRST HE FOUND UNOCCUPIED AND WAS LEFT UNDISTURBED NEXT MORNING HE SAW FROM THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE A TRAIN ACCOMPANYING A LADY WHOM HE IMAGINED TO BE THE QUEEN
3436-172162-0034 SIR LAUNCELOT FOUND HIS WAY BESET WITH OBSTACLES WHICH HE ENCOUNTERED SUCCESSFULLY BUT NOT WITHOUT MUCH LOSS OF TIME AS EVENING APPROACHED HE WAS MET BY A YOUNG AND SPORTIVE DAMSEL WHO GAYLY PROPOSED TO HIM A SUPPER
3436-172162-0035 AT HER CASTLE THE KNIGHT WHO WAS HUNGRY AND WEARY ACCEPTED THE OFFER THOUGH WITH NO VERY GOOD GRACE HE FOLLOWED THE LADY TO HER CASTLE AND ATE VORACIOUSLY OF HER SUPPER BUT WAS QUITE IMPENETRABLE TO ALL HER AMOROUS ADVANCES
3436-172162-0037 WHICH SHE TOLD HIM WOULD BY ITS CHANGES OF COLOR DISCLOSE TO HIM ALL ENCHANTMENTS AND ENABLE HIM TO SUBDUE THEM SIR LAUNCELOT PURSUED HIS JOURNEY WITHOUT BEING MUCH INCOMMODED EXCEPT BY THE TAUNTS OF TRAVELLERS
3436-172162-0038 WHO ALL SEEMED TO HAVE LEARNED BY SOME MEANS HIS DISGRACEFUL DRIVE IN THE CART ONE MORE INSOLENT THAN THE REST HAD THE AUDACITY TO INTERRUPT HIM DURING DINNER AND EVEN TO RISK A BATTLE IN SUPPORT OF HIS PLEASANTRY LAUNCELOT
3436-172162-0040 CONSULTING HIS RING AND FINDING THAT THIS WAS AN ENCHANTMENT HE BURST HIS CHAINS SEIZED HIS ARMOR IN SPITE OF THE VISIONARY MONSTERS WHO ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND IT BROKE OPEN THE GATES OF THE TOWER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY
3436-172162-0041 AT LENGTH HIS PROGRESS WAS CHECKED BY A WIDE AND RAPID TORRENT WHICH COULD ONLY BE PASSED ON A NARROW BRIDGE ON WHICH A FALSE STEP WOULD PROVE HIS DESTRUCTION LAUNCELOT LEADING HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND MAKING HIM SWIM BY HIS SIDE
3436-172162-0043 OFFERED HIM HIS ASSISTANCE AND INFORMED HIM THAT THE QUEEN WAS SAFE IN HIS CASTLE BUT COULD ONLY BE RESCUED BY ENCOUNTERING MALEAGANS LAUNCELOT DEMANDED THE BATTLE FOR THE NEXT DAY AND ACCORDINGLY IT TOOK PLACE AT THE FOOT OF THE TOWER
3436-172162-0044 AND UNDER THE EYES OF THE FAIR CAPTIVE LAUNCELOT WAS ENFEEBLED BY HIS WOUNDS AND FOUGHT NOT WITH HIS USUAL SPIRIT AND THE CONTEST FOR A TIME WAS DOUBTFUL
3436-172162-0046 MOVED BY THE ENTREATIES OF BRADEMAGUS ORDERED HIM TO WITHHOLD THE BLOW AND HE OBEYED THE CASTLE AND ITS PRISONERS WERE NOW AT HIS DISPOSAL LAUNCELOT HASTENED TO THE APARTMENT OF THE QUEEN THREW HIMSELF AT HER FEET
3436-172162-0047 AND WAS ABOUT TO KISS HER HAND WHEN SHE EXCLAIMED AH LAUNCELOT WHY DO I SEE THEE AGAIN YET FEEL THEE TO BE NO LONGER WORTHY OF ME AFTER HAVING BEEN DISGRACEFULLY DRAWN ABOUT THE COUNTRY IN A SHE HAD NOT TIME TO FINISH THE PHRASE
3436-172162-0049 IT SEEMS THAT THE STORY OF THE ABOMINABLE CART WHICH HAUNTED LAUNCELOT AT EVERY STEP HAD REACHED THE EARS OF SIR KAY WHO HAD TOLD IT TO THE QUEEN AS A PROOF THAT HER KNIGHT MUST HAVE BEEN DISHONORED
3436-172162-0050 THREE DAYS ELAPSED DURING WHICH LAUNCELOT WANDERED WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE HE WENT TILL AT LAST HE BEGAN TO REFLECT THAT HIS MISTRESS HAD DOUBTLESS BEEN DECEIVED BY MISREPRESENTATION
3436-172162-0052 HAD THE SATISFACTION OF MEETING HIM THE NEXT DAY
3436-172171-0000 WHERE HE WAS BROUGHT UP IN TOTAL IGNORANCE OF ARMS AND CHIVALRY HE WAS ALLOWED NO WEAPON
3436-172171-0002 NOT ONLY THE ANIMALS OF THE CHASE FOR THE TABLE BUT EVEN BIRDS ON THE WING AT LENGTH HOWEVER PERCEVAL WAS ROUSED TO A DESIRE OF MILITARY RENOWN BY SEEING IN THE FOREST FIVE KNIGHTS WHO WERE IN COMPLETE ARMOR
3436-172171-0003 HE SAID TO HIS MOTHER MOTHER WHAT ARE THOSE YONDER THEY ARE ANGELS MY SON SAID SHE BY MY FAITH I WILL GO AND BECOME AN ANGEL WITH THEM AND PERCEVAL WENT TO THE ROAD AND MET THEM
3436-172171-0005 SUCH AN ONE AS I AM SAID THE KNIGHT IF THOU WILT TELL ME WHAT I ASK THEE I WILL TELL THEE WHAT THOU ASKEST ME GLADLY WILL I DO SO SAID SIR OWAIN FOR THAT WAS THE KNIGHT'S NAME
3436-172171-0006 AND PERCEVAL IN RETURN GAVE HIM SUCH INFORMATION AS HE HAD THEN PERCEVAL RETURNED TO HIS MOTHER AND SAID TO HER MOTHER THOSE WERE NOT ANGELS BUT HONORABLE KNIGHTS THEN HIS MOTHER SWOONED AWAY
3436-172171-0008 AND WITH TWISTED TWIGS HE IMITATED THE TRAPPINGS WHICH HE HAD SEEN UPON THE HORSES WHEN HE CAME AGAIN TO HIS MOTHER THE COUNTESS HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON MY SON SAID SHE DESIREST THOU TO RIDE FORTH
3436-172171-0009 YES WITH THY LEAVE SAID HE GO FORWARD THEN SHE SAID TO THE COURT OF ARTHUR WHERE THERE ARE THE BEST AND THE NOBLEST AND THE MOST BOUNTIFUL OF MEN AND TELL HIM THOU ART PERCEVAL THE SON OF PELENORE

3436-172171-0012 PERCEIVING IN ONE CORNER OF THE TENT SOME FOOD TWO FLASKS FULL OF WINE AND SOME BOAR'S FLESH ROASTED HE SAID MY MOTHER TOLD ME WHENEVER I SAW MEAT AND DRINK TO TAKE IT
3436-172171-0014 AND HE GAVE THE MAIDEN HIS OWN RING IN EXCHANGE FOR HERS THEN HE MOUNTED HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY PERCEVAL JOURNEYED ON TILL HE ARRIVED AT ARTHUR'S COURT AND IT SO HAPPENED
3436-172171-0015 FOR WHEN HER PAGE WAS SERVING THE QUEEN WITH A GOLDEN GOBLET THIS KNIGHT STRUCK THE ARM OF THE PAGE AND DASHED THE WINE IN THE QUEEN'S FACE AND OVER HER STOMACHER THEN HE SAID
3436-172171-0017 FOR IT SEEMED TO THEM THAT NO ONE WOULD HAVE VENTURED ON SO DARING AN OUTRAGE UNLESS HE POSSESSED SUCH POWERS THROUGH MAGIC OR CHARMS THAT NONE COULD BE ABLE TO PUNISH HIM JUST THEN BEHOLD
3436-172171-0018 PERCEVAL ENTERED THE HALL UPON THE BONY PIEBALD HORSE WITH HIS UNCOUTH TRAPPINGS IN THE CENTRE OF THE HALL STOOD KAY THE SENESCHAL TELL ME TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL IS THAT ARTHUR YONDER
3436-172171-0020 THEN ALL THE HOUSEHOLD BEGAN TO JEER AND LAUGH AT HIM BUT THERE WAS A CERTAIN DAMSEL WHO HAD BEEN A WHOLE YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT

3436-172171-0024 THOU ART ILL TAUGHT TO REMAIN A YEAR AT ARTHUR'S COURT WITH CHOICE OF SOCIETY AND SMILE ON NO ONE AND NOW BEFORE THE FACE OF ARTHUR AND ALL HIS KNIGHTS TO CALL SUCH A MAN AS THIS THE FLOWER OF KNIGHTHOOD
3436-172171-0026 I WILL DO SO TALL MAN SAID PERCEVAL SO HE TURNED HIS HORSE'S HEAD TOWARD THE MEADOW AND WHEN HE CAME THERE THE KNIGHT WAS RIDING UP AND DOWN PROUD OF HIS STRENGTH AND VALOR AND NOBLE MIEN TELL ME SAID THE KNIGHT

3436-172171-0030 UPON THIS THE KNIGHT RAN AT HIM FURIOUSLY AND STRUCK HIM A VIOLENT BLOW WITH THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR
3436-172171-0032 VERILY SAID SIR OWAIN THE SON OF URIEN TO KAY THE SENESCHAL THOU WAST ILL ADVISED TO SEND THAT MADMAN AFTER THE KNIGHT FOR HE MUST EITHER BE OVERTHROWN OR FLEE AND EITHER WAY IT WILL BE A DISGRACE TO ARTHUR AND HIS WARRIORS
3436-172171-0033 THEREFORE WILL I GO TO SEE WHAT HAS BEFALLEN HIM SO SIR OWAIN WENT TO THE MEADOW AND HE FOUND PERCEVAL TRYING IN VAIN TO GET THE DEAD KNIGHT'S ARMOR OFF IN ORDER TO CLOTHE HIMSELF WITH IT
3436-172171-0035 AND URGED ON HIS HORSE WITH A STICK THEN OWAIN WOULD HAVE HAD HIM RETURN TO THE COURT TO RECEIVE THE PRAISE THAT WAS HIS DUE BUT PERCEVAL SAID I WILL NOT COME TO THE COURT TILL I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE TALL MAN THAT IS THERE
3436-172171-0036 TO REVENGE THE INJURY HE DID TO THE MAIDEN BUT TAKE THOU THE GOBLET TO QUEEN GUENEVER AND TELL KING ARTHUR THAT WHEREVER I AM I WILL BE HIS VASSAL AND WILL DO HIM WHAT PROFIT AND SERVICE I CAN AND SIR OWAIN
3436-172171-0038 AND HE CAME TO A LAKE ON THE SIDE OF WHICH WAS A FAIR CASTLE AND ON THE BORDER OF THE LAKE HE SAW A HOARY HEADED MAN SITTING UPON A VELVET CUSHION AND HIS ATTENDANTS WERE FISHING IN THE LAKE
3436-172171-0039 WHEN THE HOARY HEADED MAN BEHELD PERCEVAL APPROACHING HE AROSE AND WENT INTO THE CASTLE PERCEVAL RODE TO THE CASTLE AND THE DOOR WAS OPEN AND HE ENTERED THE HALL
3436-172171-0041 IF HE KNEW HOW TO FIGHT WITH THE SWORD I KNOW NOT SAID PERCEVAL BUT WERE I TO BE TAUGHT DOUBTLESS I SHOULD AND THE HOARY HEADED MAN SAID TO HIM I AM THY UNCLE THY MOTHER'S BROTHER I AM CALLED KING PECHEUR
3436-172171-0042 FOOTNOTE THE WORD MEANS BOTH FISHER AND SINNER THOU SHALT REMAIN WITH ME A SPACE IN ORDER TO LEARN THE MANNERS AND CUSTOMS OF DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND COURTESY AND NOBLE BEARING AND THIS DO THOU REMEMBER

3436-172171-0045 AND WHEN ALL THE COMPANY SAW THIS THEY BEGAN TO WEEP AND LAMENT BUT FOR ALL THAT THE MAN DID NOT BREAK OFF HIS DISCOURSE WITH PERCEVAL AND AS HE DID NOT TELL HIM THE MEANING OF WHAT HE SAW HE FOREBORE TO ASK HIM CONCERNING IT
3436-172171-0047 PERCEVAL ENTERED A VALLEY AND CAME TO A HERMIT'S CELL AND THE HERMIT WELCOMED HIM GLADLY AND THERE HE SPENT THE NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING HE AROSE AND WHEN HE WENT FORTH BEHOLD A SHOWER OF SNOW HAD FALLEN IN THE NIGHT AND A HAWK
3436-172171-0048 HAD KILLED A WILD FOWL IN FRONT OF THE CELL AND THE NOISE OF THE HORSE HAD SCARED THE HAWK AWAY AND A RAVEN ALIGHTED ON THE BIRD AND PERCEVAL STOOD AND COMPARED THE BLACKNESS OF THE RAVEN AND THE WHITENESS OF THE SNOW
3436-172171-0050 NOW ARTHUR AND HIS HOUSEHOLD WERE IN SEARCH OF PERCEVAL AND BY CHANCE THEY CAME THAT WAY KNOW YE SAID ARTHUR WHO IS THE KNIGHT WITH THE LONG SPEAR THAT STANDS BY THE BROOK UP YONDER LORD SAID ONE OF THEM
3436-172171-0051 I WILL GO AND LEARN WHO HE IS
3436-172171-0053 AND WHEN THE YOUTH RETURNED TO THE KING AND TOLD HOW RUDELY HE HAD BEEN TREATED SIR KAY SAID I WILL GO MYSELF AND WHEN HE GREETED PERCEVAL AND GOT NO ANSWER HE SPOKE TO HIM RUDELY AND ANGRILY
3436-172171-0054 AND PERCEVAL THRUST AT HIM WITH HIS LANCE AND CAST HIM DOWN SO THAT HE BROKE HIS ARM AND HIS SHOULDER BLADE AND WHILE HE LAY THUS STUNNED HIS HORSE RETURNED BACK AT A WILD AND PRANCING PACE THEN SAID

3436-172171-0057 AND PERCEVAL WAS RESTING ON THE SHAFT OF HIS SPEAR PONDERING THE SAME THOUGHT
3436-172171-0059 AND TWO MEN HAVE BEEN BEFORE ON THIS ERRAND THAT IS TRUE SAID PERCEVAL AND UNCOURTEOUSLY THEY CAME THEY ATTACKED ME AND I WAS ANNOYED THEREAT THEN HE TOLD HIM THE THOUGHT THAT OCCUPIED HIS MIND
3436-172171-0060 AND GAWAIN SAID THIS WAS NOT AN UNGENTLE THOUGHT AND I SHOULD MARVEL IF IT WERE PLEASANT FOR THEE TO BE DRAWN FROM IT THEN SAID PERCEVAL TELL ME IS SIR KAY IN ARTHUR'S COURT

3440-171006-0002 MY KINSMEN ACCORDING TO THE FLESH BRETHREN MY HEART'S DESIRE AND PRAYER TO GOD FOR ISRAEL IS THAT THEY MIGHT BE SAVED AND SUCH DEAR READER IS IN GREATER OR LESS DEGREE THE FEELING OF EVERY RENEWED HEART
3440-171006-0003 LOVING JESUS IT WOULD FAIN HAVE OTHERS LOVE HIM TOO IT DESIRES THE SALVATION OF ALL BUT FOR THAT OF ITS OWN DEAR ONES IT LONGS AND LABORS AND PRAYS IT IS LIKE JACOB WRESTLING WITH THE ANGEL WHEN HE SAID
3440-171006-0005 SHE SAW THAT IF HE PERMITTED HER TO READ TO HIM FROM GOD'S WORD AS HE SOMETIMES DID IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY PLEASURE IN LISTENING BUT ONLY TO PLEASE HER SHE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE HE EVER PRAYED AND THOUGH HE WENT REGULARLY TO CHURCH
3440-171006-0006 IT WAS BECAUSE HE CONSIDERED IT PROPER AND RESPECTABLE TO DO SO AND NOT THAT HE CARED TO WORSHIP GOD OR TO LEARN HIS WILL THIS CONVICTION WHICH HAD GRADUALLY DAWNED UPON ELSIE UNTIL NOW IT AMOUNTED TO CERTAINTY CAUSED HER GREAT GRIEF
3440-171006-0008 THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NO A CHANGE OF HEART WERE NECESSARY TO SALVATION THE GENERAL OPINION SEEMED TO BE THAT IT WAS NOT AND ELSIE LISTENED WITH PAIN WHILE HER FATHER EXPRESSED HIS DECIDED CONVICTION THAT ALL WHO LED AN HONEST UPRIGHT MORAL LIFE
3440-171006-0009 AND ATTENDED TO THE OUTWARD OBSERVANCES OF RELIGION WERE QUITE SAFE HE COULD SEE NO NECESSITY FOR A CHANGE OF HEART HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DEPRAVITY NOT HE NO INDEED HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUCH BETTER THAN MANY PEOPLE WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE
3440-171006-0011 HE STOPPED REMARKING YOUR LITTLE GIRL LOOKS AS IF SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT WHAT IS IT MY DEAR ELSIE BLUSHED HESITATED AND LOOKED AT HER FATHER YES SPEAK MY DAUGHTER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY HE SAID ENCOURAGINGLY ELSIE LIFTED

3440-171006-0014 AND NOW SINCE YOU CONSIDER THAT CHANGE SO NECESSARY CAN YOU TELL ME HOW IT IS TO BE BROUGHT ABOUT GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT ALONE CAN CHANGE A SINNER'S HEART SIR AND HOW AM I TO SECURE HIS AID HE ASKED ELSIE ANSWERED WITH A TEXT
3440-171006-0015 SHE REPLIED THE SWEET LITTLE FACE ALL SUFFUSED WITH BLUSHES AND THE SOFT DOWNCAST EYES FILLING WITH TEARS WHY DO YOU THINK SO HE ASKED AGAIN
3440-171006-0017 WITH MEEKNESS AND FEAR THEN RAISING HER EYES TO HIS FACE WITH A TOUCHING MIXTURE OF DEEP HUMILITY AND HOLY BOLDNESS SHE CONTINUED AND THIS SIR IS MY ANSWER JESUS SAYS HIM THAT COMETH UNTO ME I WILL IN NO WISE CAST OUT
3440-171006-0018 AND I BELIEVE HIM I DID GO TO HIM AND HE DID NOT CAST ME OUT BUT FORGAVE MY SINS AND TAUGHT ME TO LOVE HIM AND DESIRE TO SERVE HIM ALL MY LIFE THIS CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GENTLEMAN AND THE LITTLE GIRL HAD DRAWN THE ATTENTION OF ALL PRESENT

3440-171009-0059 AND SET HER DOWN THE LITTLE GIRLS WATCHED UNTIL THE LAST OF THE PARTY HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN THE AVENUE AND THEN RAN GAYLY UP STAIRS TO ELSIE'S ROOM WHERE THEY BUSIED THEMSELVES UNTIL TEA TIME IN VARIOUS LITTLE PREPARATIONS FOR THE EVENING
3440-171009-0060 WHO PASSED IN AND OUT WITH AN AIR OF MYSTERY AND IMPORTANCE AND GENERALLY LADEN WITH SOME ODD LOOKING BUNDLE WHEN GOING IN WHICH THEY INVARIABLY LEFT BEHIND ON COMING OUT AGAIN AND MANY A WHISPERED CONSULTATION HAD BEEN HELD AS TO WHAT WAS PROBABLY GOING ON IN THERE
3440-171009-0062 THAT THEIR CURIOSITY WAS NOW ON THE POINT OF BEING GRATIFIED
3440-171009-0063 AND EVERY FACE BRIGHTENED WITH MIRTH AND EXPECTATION AND WHEN A MOMENT AFTER THE DOORS WERE THROWN OPEN THERE WAS A UNIVERSAL BURST OF APPLAUSE A LARGE CHRISTMAS TREE HAD BEEN SET UP AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
3440-171009-0065 MISSUS DINSMORE AND ADELAIDE APPROACHED THE TREE AND BEGAN THE PLEASANT TASK OF DISTRIBUTING THE GIFTS EVERYTHING WAS LABELLED AND EACH AS HIS OR HER NAME WAS CALLED OUT STEPPED FORWARD TO RECEIVE THE PRESENT NO ONE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN EACH HAD SOMETHING

3440-171009-0074 AND THAT IS YOUR MINIATURE TO HER SURPRISE HE LOOKED HIGHLY PLEASED AT HER REPLY AND GIVING HER ANOTHER KISS SAID WELL DARLING SOME DAY YOU SHALL HAVE IT
3440-171009-0075 MISTER HORACE DINSMORE CALLED ADELAIDE TAKING SOME SMALL GLITTERING OBJECT FROM THE TREE ANOTHER PRESENT FOR ME HE ASKED AS WALTER CAME RUNNING WITH IT HE HAD ALREADY RECEIVED SEVERAL FROM HIS FATHER AND SISTERS

3440-171009-0080 THEN PLEASE KEEP IT FOR ME UNTIL TO MORROW PAPA WILL YOU YES HE SAID
3440-171009-0081 AND THEN AS THE GIFTS HAD ALL BEEN DISTRIBUTED AND THE LITTLE FOLKS WERE IN HIGH GLEE A VARIETY OF SPORTS WERE COMMENCED BY THEM IN WHICH SOME OF THEIR ELDERS ALSO TOOK A PART AND THUS THE HOURS SPED AWAY SO RAPIDLY
3486-166424-0000 AS I GAZED UPON THEM I WONDERED TO WHAT SECRET PLACE WITHIN THEIR BROODING IMMENSITIES THE LITTLE METAL MYSTERIES HAD FLED AND TO WHAT MYRIADS IT MIGHT BE OF THEIR KIND
3486-166424-0001 OF WHAT POWERS SMALL LIKE THESE OR OR QUICK ON THE SCREEN OF MY MIND FLASHED TWO PICTURES SIDE BY SIDE
3486-166424-0003 THEN LEAPED TO THE VERY BRIM OF THE BOWL A LARK HAD RISEN FROM THE ROOF OF ONE OF THE SHATTERED HEAPS AND HAD FLOWN CAROLING UP INTO THE SHADOWY SKY A FLOCK OF THE LITTLE WILLOW WARBLERS FLUNG THEMSELVES ACROSS THE VALLEY SCOLDING AND GOSSIPING
3486-166424-0004 A HARE SAT UPRIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ANCIENT ROADWAY THE VALLEY ITSELF LAY SERENELY UNDER THE AMBERING LIGHT SMILING PEACEFUL EMPTIED OF HORROR
3486-166424-0006 GONE WAS THAT SOUL OF LONELINESS VANISHED THE WHIRLPOOL OF DESPAIR THAT HAD STRIVEN TO DRAG US DOWN TO DEATH THE BOWL WAS NOTHING BUT A QUIET SMILING LOVELY LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE HILLS I LOOKED BACK
3486-166424-0007 EVEN THE RUINS HAD LOST THEIR SINISTER SHAPE WERE TIME WORN CRUMBLING PILES NOTHING MORE
3486-166424-0009 DOWN IT WAS POURING AN AVALANCHE OF MEN I CAUGHT THE GLINT OF HELMETS AND CORSELETS THOSE IN THE VAN WERE MOUNTED GALLOPING TWO ABREAST UPON SURE FOOTED MOUNTAIN PONIES THEIR SHORT SWORDS LIFTED HIGH FLICKERED
3486-166424-0010 AFTER THE HORSEMEN SWARMED FOOT SOLDIERS A FOREST OF SHINING POINTS AND DULLY GLEAMING PIKES ABOVE THEM CLEARLY TO US CAME THEIR BATTLECRIES AGAIN VENTNOR'S RIFLE CRACKED ONE OF THE FOREMOST RIDERS WENT DOWN ANOTHER STUMBLED OVER HIM FELL

3486-166424-0013 ALL MY AMMUNITION IS ON HIM CHIU MING'S TAKING CARE OF THAT I GASPED WE DARTED OUT OF THE GATEWAY A GOOD FIVE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY WERE RUTH AND DRAKE RUNNING STRAIGHT TO THE GREEN TUNNEL'S MOUTH BETWEEN THEM AND US WAS CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY
3486-166424-0015 FELL FAR SHORT DON'T LOOK BACK GRUNTED VENTNOR STRETCH YOURSELF WALTER THERE'S A SURPRISE COMING HOPE TO GOD I JUDGED THE TIME RIGHT WE TURNED OFF THE RUINED WAY
3486-166424-0016 HE REACHED OUT TOUCHED ME YOU'RE RIGHT WALTER HE GRINNED IT DOES SEEM LIKE CARRYING COALS TO NEWCASTLE
3486-166424-0018 AND HOLDING RUTH BY THE HAND RACE BACK TOWARD US EVEN AS HE TURNED THE VINE SCREENED ENTRANCE THROUGH WHICH WE HAD COME THROUGH WHICH WE HAD THOUGHT LAY SAFETY STREAMED OTHER ARMORED MEN WE WERE OUTFLANKED TO THE FISSURE SHOUTED VENTNOR
3486-166424-0019 DRAKE HEARD FOR HE CHANGED HIS COURSE TO THE CREVICE AT WHOSE MOUTH RUTH HAD SAID THE LITTLE THINGS HAD LAIN AFTER HIM STREAKED CHIU MING URGING ON THE PONY SHOUTING OUT OF THE TUNNEL DOWN OVER THE LIP OF THE BOWL LEAPED THE SOLDIERS
3486-166424-0021 PUSH HER FROM HIM TOWARD IT SHE SHOOK HER HEAD NOW CHIU MING WAS WITH THEM RUTH SPRANG TO THE PONY LIFTED FROM ITS BACK A RIFLE THEN INTO THE MASS OF THEIR PURSUERS DRAKE AND SHE POURED A FUSILLADE THEY HUDDLED WAVERED BROKE FOR COVER
3486-166424-0022 A CHANCE GASPED VENTNOR BEHIND US WAS A WOLFLIKE YELPING THE FIRST PACK HAD RE FORMED HAD CROSSED THE BARRICADE THE DYNAMITE HAD MADE WAS RUSHING UPON US I RAN AS I HAD NEVER KNOWN I COULD
3486-166424-0024 NATURE'S SUMMONING OF EVERY RESERVE TO MEET THAT PERIL MY EYES TOOK THEM IN WITH PHOTOGRAPHIC NICETY THE LINKED MAIL LACQUERED BLUE AND SCARLET OF THE HORSEMEN BROWN PADDED ARMOR OF THE FOOTMEN
3486-166424-0025 THEIR BOWS AND JAVELINS AND SHORT BRONZE SWORDS THEIR PIKES AND SHIELDS AND UNDER THEIR ROUND HELMETS THEIR CRUEL BEARDED FACES WHITE AS OUR OWN WHERE THE BLACK BEARDS DID NOT COVER THEM THEIR FIERCE AND MOCKING EYES
3486-166424-0027 I WONDERED WHY FOR NOW WE WERE WELL WITHIN THEIR RANGE
3486-166424-0028 WE'VE SAVED RUTH ANYWAY HE SAID DRAKE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THAT HOLE IN THE WALL HE'S GOT LOTS OF AMMUNITION ON THE PONY BUT THEY'VE GOT US ANOTHER WILD SHOUTING DOWN SWEPT THE PACK
3486-166424-0030 WHAT WAS IT AT WHICH THEY WERE GLARING OVER OUR HEADS AND WHY HAD THE RIFLE FIRE OF RUTH AND DRAKE CEASED SO ABRUPTLY SIMULTANEOUSLY WE TURNED WITHIN THE BLACK BACKGROUND OF THE FISSURE STOOD A SHAPE AN APPARITION
3486-166424-0031 A WOMAN BEAUTIFUL AWESOME INCREDIBLE SHE WAS TALL STANDING THERE SWATHED FROM CHIN TO FEET IN CLINGING VEILS OF PALE AMBER SHE SEEMED TALLER EVEN THAN TALL DRAKE
3486-166424-0033 LIKE A MISTY BANNER OF WOVEN COPPER FLAMES NO NOR THAT THROUGH HER VEILS HER BODY GLEAMED FAINT RADIANCE IT WAS HER EYES HER GREAT WIDE EYES WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS WERE LIKE POOLS OF LIVING STAR FIRES
3486-166424-0034 THEY SHONE FROM HER WHITE FACE NOT PHOSPHORESCENT NOT MERELY LUCENT AND LIGHT REFLECTING BUT AS THOUGH THEY THEMSELVES WERE SOURCES OF THE COLD WHITE FLAMES OF FAR STARS AND AS CALM AS THOSE STARS THEMSELVES
3486-166424-0036 THE WOMAN STEPPED FROM THE CREVICE NOT FIFTY FEET FROM HER WERE RUTH AND DRAKE AND CHIU MING THEIR RIGID ATTITUDES REVEALING THE SAME SHOCK OF AWE THAT HAD MOMENTARILY PARALYZED ME SHE LOOKED AT THEM BECKONED THEM
3486-166424-0037 I SAW THE TWO WALK TOWARD HER CHIU MING HANG BACK THE GREAT EYES FELL UPON VENTNOR AND MYSELF SHE RAISED A HAND MOTIONED US TO APPROACH I TURNED THERE STOOD THE HOST THAT HAD POURED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN ROAD
3486-166424-0039 THEY STOOD IN SILENCE LIKE AUTOMATONS ONLY THEIR FIERCELY STARING EYES SHOWING THAT THEY WERE ALIVE QUICK BREATHED VENTNOR WE RAN TOWARD HER WHO HAD CHECKED DEATH EVEN WHILE ITS JAWS WERE CLOSING UPON US
3486-166424-0040 BEFORE WE HAD GONE HALF WAY AS THOUGH OUR FLIGHT HAD BROKEN WHATEVER BONDS HAD BOUND THEM A CLAMOR AROSE FROM THE HOST A WILD SHOUTING A CLANGING OF SWORDS ON SHIELDS I SHOT A GLANCE BEHIND THEY WERE IN MOTION ADVANCING SLOWLY
3486-166424-0042 THEIR GAZE FASTENED UPON THE SWATHED WOMAN VENTNOR'S HAND SHOT OUT GRIPPED MY SHOULDER HALTED ME SHE HAD THROWN UP HER HEAD
3486-166424-0043 FROM THE LIFTED THROAT CAME A LOW A VIBRANT CRY HARMONIOUS WEIRDLY DISQUIETING GOLDEN AND SWEET AND LADEN WITH THE EERY MINOR WAILINGS OF THE BLUE VALLEY'S NIGHT THE DRAGONED CHAMBER
3486-166424-0045 GLOBES AND CUBES AND PYRAMIDS NOT SMALL LIKE THOSE OF THE RUINS BUT SHAPES ALL OF FOUR FEET HIGH DULLY LUSTROUS AND DEEP WITHIN THAT LUSTER THE MYRIADS OF TINY POINTS OF LIGHT LIKE UNWINKING STARING EYES
3486-166424-0046 THEY SWIRLED EDDIED AND FORMED A BARRICADE BETWEEN US AND THE ARMORED MEN DOWN UPON THEM POURED A SHOWER OF ARROWS FROM THE SOLDIERS I HEARD THE SHOUTS OF THEIR CAPTAINS THEY RUSHED THEY HAD COURAGE THOSE MEN YES AGAIN CAME THE WOMAN'S CRY
3486-166424-0048 EIGHT FEET IN WIDTH AND TWENTY FEET HIGH IT SHAPED ITSELF OUT FROM ITS LEFT SIDE FROM RIGHT SIDE SPRANG ARMS FEARFUL ARMS THAT GREW AND GREW AS GLOBE AND CUBE AND ANGLE RACED UP THE COLUMN'S SIDE AND CLICKED INTO PLACE EACH UPON EACH AFTER THE OTHER
3486-166424-0049 WITH MAGICAL QUICKNESS THE ARMS LENGTHENED BEFORE US STOOD A MONSTROUS SHAPE A GEOMETRIC PRODIGY
3486-166424-0051 FLEXING THEMSELVES IN GROTESQUE IMITATION OF A BOXER
3486-166424-0052 AGAIN IN GIGANTIC AWFUL PARODY OF THE SPIKED GLOVES OF THOSE ANCIENT GLADIATORS WHO FOUGHT FOR IMPERIAL NERO
3486-166424-0054 UNDER THE DARKENING SKY IN THE GREEN OF THE HOLLOW THE ARMORED HOSTS FROZEN BEFORE IT AND THEN IT STRUCK OUT FLASHED TWO OF THE ARMS WITH A GLANCING MOTION WITH APPALLING FORCE
3486-166424-0055 THEY SLICED INTO THE CLOSE PACKED FORWARD RANKS OF THE ARMORED MEN CUT OUT OF THEM TWO GREAT GAPS SICKENED I SAW FRAGMENTS OF MAN AND HORSE FLY ANOTHER ARM JAVELINED FROM ITS PLACE LIKE A FLYING SNAKE CLICKED AT THE END OF ANOTHER
3486-166424-0057 ALL THAT HOST WHICH HAD DRIVEN US FROM THE RUINS THREW DOWN SWORD SPEAR AND PIKE FLED SHRIEKING THE HORSEMEN SPURRED THEIR MOUNTS RIDING HEEDLESS OVER THE FOOTMEN WHO FLED WITH THEM THE SMITING THING SEEMED TO WATCH THEM GO
3486-166424-0058 WITH AMUSEMENT BEFORE THEY COULD COVER A HUNDRED YARDS IT HAD DISINTEGRATED I HEARD THE LITTLE WAILING SOUNDS THEN BEHIND THE FLEEING MEN CLOSE BEHIND THEM ROSE THE ANGLED PILLAR INTO PLACE SPRANG THE FLEXING ARMS AND AGAIN IT TOOK ITS TOLL OF THEM
3486-166424-0060 IT MELTED ONCE MORE TOOK NEW FORM WHERE HAD BEEN PILLAR AND FLAILING ARMS WAS NOW A TRIPOD THIRTY FEET HIGH ITS LEGS ALTERNATE GLOBE AND CUBE AND UPON ITS APEX A WIDE AND SPINNING RING OF SPARKLING SPHERES
3486-166424-0061 OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THIS RING STRETCHED A TENTACLE WRITHING UNDULATING LIKE A SERPENT OF STEEL FOUR SCORE YARDS AT LEAST IN LENGTH
3486-166424-0063 IT WAS I THINK THAT LAST TOUCH OF SHEER HORROR THE PLAYFULNESS OF THE SMITING THING THAT SENT MY DRY TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF MY TERROR PARCHED MOUTH AND HELD OPEN WITH MONSTROUS FASCINATION EYES THAT STRUGGLED TO CLOSE
3486-166424-0064 EVER THE ARMORED MEN FLED FROM IT AND EVER WAS IT SWIFTER THAN THEY TEETERING AT THEIR HEELS ON ITS TRIPOD LEGS FROM HALF ITS LENGTH THE DARTING SNAKE STREAMED RED RAIN I HEARD A SIGH FROM RUTH
3486-166424-0066 VIEWING IT IT CAME TO ME WITH EYES IMPERSONAL COLD INDIFFERENT AS THE UNTROUBLED STARS WHICH LOOK DOWN UPON HURRICANE AND EARTHQUAKE IN THIS WORLD OF OURS THERE WAS A RUSHING OF MANY FEET AT OUR LEFT A WAIL FROM CHIU MING
3486-166424-0067 WERE THEY MADDENED BY FEAR DRIVEN BY DESPAIR DETERMINED TO SLAY BEFORE THEY THEMSELVES WERE SLAIN I DO NOT KNOW BUT THOSE WHO STILL LIVED OF THE MEN FROM THE TUNNEL MOUTH WERE CHARGING US THEY CLUSTERED CLOSE THEIR SHIELDS HELD BEFORE THEM
3486-166424-0069 I HEARD CHIU MING SCREAM SAW HIM THROW UP HIS HANDS COVER HIS EYES RUN STRAIGHT UPON THE PIKES CHIU MING I SHOUTED CHIU MING THIS WAY I RAN TOWARD HIM
3486-166424-0070 I SAW A SPEAR THROWN IT STRUCK THE CHINAMAN SQUARELY IN THE BREAST HE TOTTERED FELL UPON HIS KNEES EVEN AS HE DROPPED THE GIANT FLAIL SWEPT DOWN UPON THE SOLDIERS IT SWEPT THROUGH THEM LIKE A SCYTHE THROUGH RIPE GRAIN
3486-166424-0072 I THOUGHT THAT SHIN JE WAS ABOUT TO SLAY US HE WHISPERED FEAR BLINDED ME HIS HEAD DROPPED HIS BODY QUIVERED LAY STILL WE AROSE LOOKED ABOUT US DAZEDLY
3486-166424-0073 AT THE SIDE OF THE CREVICE STOOD THE WOMAN HER GAZE RESTING UPON DRAKE HIS ARMS ABOUT RUTH HER HEAD HIDDEN ON HIS BREAST THE VALLEY WAS EMPTY SAVE FOR THE HUDDLED HEAPS THAT DOTTED IT
3486-166424-0075 HIGH UP IN THE DARKENING HEAVENS THE LAMMERGEIERS THE WINGED SCAVENGERS OF THE HIMALAYAS WERE GATHERING THE WOMAN LIFTED HER HAND BECKONED US ONCE MORE SLOWLY WE WALKED TOWARD HER STOOD BEFORE HER
3486-166446-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN THE DRUMS OF DESTINY SLOWLY WE DESCENDED THAT MOUNT OF DESOLATION LINGERINGLY AS THOUGH THE BROODING EYES OF NORHALA WERE NOT YET SATED WITH DESTRUCTION
3486-166446-0002 PALACE TEMPLE AND HOME NORHALA HAD STAMPED FLAT SHE HAD CRUSHED THEM WITHIN THE ROCK EVEN AS SHE HAD PROMISED THE TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY HAD ABSORBED MY EVERY FACULTY
3486-166446-0003 NOW IN THE PAINFUL SURGES OF AWAKENING REALIZATION OF FULL HUMAN UNDERSTANDING OF THAT INHUMAN ANNIHILATION I TURNED TO THEM FOR STRENGTH FAINTLY I WONDERED AGAIN AT RUTH'S SCANTINESS OF GARB HER MORE THAN HALF NUDITY
3486-166446-0005 BUT IN THE EYES OF RUTH WAS NONE OF THIS STERNLY COLDLY TRIUMPHANT INDIFFERENT TO ITS PITEOUSNESS AS NORHALA HERSELF SHE SCANNED THE WASTE THAT LESS THAN AN HOUR SINCE HAD BEEN A PLACE OF LIVING BEAUTY I FELT A SHOCK OF REPULSION AFTER ALL
3486-166446-0006 YET MOTHER AND BLOSSOMING MAID YOUTH AND OLDSTER ALL THE PAGEANT OF HUMANITY WITHIN THE GREAT WALLS WERE NOW BUT LINES WITHIN THE STONE ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT LIGHTS IT CAME TO ME THERE HAD BEEN
3486-166446-0008 THERE WAS DRIED BLOOD ON THE EDGES A DOUBLE RING OF SWOLLEN WHITE FLESH RIMMING THE CINCTURE IT WAS THE MARK OF TORTURE MARTIN I CRIED THAT RING WHAT DID THEY DO TO YOU THEY WAKED ME WITH THAT HE ANSWERED QUIETLY
3486-166446-0009 I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BE GRATEFUL ALTHOUGH THEIR INTENTIONS WERE NOT EXACTLY THERAPEUTIC THEY TORTURED HIM RUTH'S VOICE WAS TENSE BITTER SHE SPOKE IN PERSIAN FOR NORHALA'S BENEFIT I THOUGHT THEN NOT GUESSING A DEEPER REASON
3486-166446-0011 ME THEY STRIPPED LIKE A SLAVE THEY LED ME THROUGH THE CITY AND THE PEOPLE MOCKED ME
3486-166446-0012 BEFORE MY EYES THEY TORTURED MY BROTHER NORHALA THEY WERE EVIL ALL EVIL NORHALA YOU DID WELL TO SLAY THEM SHE CAUGHT THE WOMAN'S HANDS PRESSED CLOSE TO HER
3486-166446-0014 AND IT WAS WELL DONE SISTER NOW YOU AND I SHALL DWELL TOGETHER IN PEACE SISTER OR IF THERE BE THOSE IN THE WORLD FROM WHICH YOU CAME THAT YOU WOULD HAVE SLAIN
3486-166446-0015 THEN YOU AND I SHALL GO FORTH WITH OUR COMPANIES AND STAMP THEM OUT EVEN AS I DID THESE MY HEART STOPPED BEATING FOR FROM THE DEPTHS OF RUTH'S EYES SHINING SHADOWS WERE RISING WRAITHS ANSWERING NORHALA'S CALLING
3486-166446-0017 AND AT LAST IT WAS TWIN SISTER OF NORHALA WHO LOOKED UPON HER FROM THE FACE OF RUTH THE WHITE ARMS OF THE WOMAN ENCIRCLED HER THE GLORIOUS HEAD BENT OVER HER FLAMING TRESSES MINGLED WITH TENDER BROWN CURLS
3486-166446-0018 SISTER SHE WHISPERED LITTLE SISTER THESE MEN YOU SHALL HAVE AS LONG AS IT PLEASES YOU TO DO WITH AS YOU WILL OR IF IT IS YOUR WISH THEY SHALL GO BACK TO THEIR WORLD AND I WILL GUARD THEM TO ITS GATES
3486-166446-0020 LOVER BROTHER OLD FRIEND RUTH CREPT CLOSER TO HER RESTED HER HEAD UPON THE VIRGINAL ROYAL BREASTS IT SHALL BE SO SHE MURMURED SISTER IT SHALL BE SO NORHALA I AM TIRED NORHALA I HAVE SEEN ENOUGH OF MEN
3486-166446-0021 AN ECSTASY OF TENDERNESS A FLAME OF UNEARTHLY RAPTURE TREMBLED OVER THE WOMAN'S WONDROUS FACE HUNGRILY DEFIANTLY SHE PRESSED THE GIRL TO HER THE STARS IN THE LUCID HEAVENS OF HER EYES WERE SOFT AND GENTLE AND CARESSING
3486-166446-0023 THERE WAS A CURIOUS UNDERSTANDING IN HIS VOICE A CURIOUS SYMPATHY TOO IN THE PATIENT UNTROUBLED GAZE THAT DWELT UPON HIS SISTER AND THIS WEIRDLY EXQUISITE WOMAN WHO HELD HER WAIT EXCLAIMED DRAKE WAIT HELL THE DAMNED WITCH IS STEALING HER AWAY FROM US
3486-166446-0024 AGAIN HE THREW HIMSELF FORWARD RECOILED AS THOUGH SWEPT BACK BY AN INVISIBLE ARM FELL AGAINST US AND WAS CLASPED AND HELD BY VENTNOR AND AS HE STRUGGLED THE THING WE RODE HALTED
3486-166446-0026 IT WAS AS THOUGH NORHALA HAD DECREED IT AS A SYMBOL OF THIS HER SECOND VICTORY OR HAD SET IT BETWEEN US AS A BARRIER WIDER GREW THE RIFT
3486-166446-0027 SAVE FOR THE BRIDGE OF OUR VOICES IT SEPARATED US FROM RUTH AS THOUGH SHE STOOD UPON ANOTHER WORLD HIGHER WE ROSE THE THREE OF US NOW UPON THE FLAT TOP OF A TOWER UPON WHOSE COUNTERPART FIFTY FEET AWAY
3486-166446-0029 SILENTLY WE STREAMED THROUGH THE CHASM THROUGH THE CANYON AND THE TUNNEL SPEAKING NO WORD DRAKE'S EYES FIXED WITH BITTER HATRED UPON NORHALA VENTNOR BROODING UPON HER ALWAYS WITH THAT ENIGMATIC SYMPATHY WE PASSED BETWEEN THE WALLS OF THE FURTHER CLEFT
3486-166446-0030 STOOD FOR AN INSTANT AT THE BRINK OF THE GREEN FOREST THERE CAME TO US AS THOUGH FROM IMMEASURABLE DISTANCES A FAINT SUSTAINED THRUMMING LIKE THE BEATING OF COUNTLESS MUFFLED DRUMS THE THING THAT CARRIED US TREMBLED THE SOUND DIED AWAY
3486-166446-0032 PURGED NOT ONLY BY SUFFERING BUT BY IT CAME TO ME SOME STRANGE KNOWLEDGE NO USE DRAKE HE SAID DREAMILY
3486-166446-0033 BUT THIS I DO KNOW ONLY ONE WAY OR ANOTHER CAN THE BALANCE FALL AND IF IT BE ONE WAY THEN YOU AND WE SHALL HAVE RUTH BACK AND IF IT FALLS THE OTHER WAY THEN THERE WILL BE LITTLE NEED FOR US TO CARE FOR MAN WILL BE DONE MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN
3486-166446-0035 IS IT TAPS FOR THEM THE DRUMMING DIED AS I LISTENED FEARFULLY ABOUT US WAS ONLY THE SWISHING THE SIGHING OF THE FALLING TREES BENEATH THE TREAD OF THE THING MOTIONLESS STOOD NORHALA
3486-166446-0036 AND AS MOTIONLESS RUTH MARTIN I CRIED ONCE MORE A DREADFUL DOUBT UPON ME MARTIN WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHENCE DID THEY COME HIS VOICE WAS CLEAR AND CALM THE EYES BENEATH
3486-166446-0038 AS THOUGH THEY HEARD AND UNDERSTOOD I DO NOT FORGET HE SAID AT LEAST NOT ALL DO I FORGET OF WHAT I SAW DURING THAT TIME WHEN I SEEMED AN ATOM OUTSIDE SPACE
3486-166446-0039 AS I TOLD YOU OR THINK I TOLD YOU SPEAKING WITH UNTHINKABLE EFFORT THROUGH LIPS THAT SEEMED ETERNITIES AWAY FROM ME THE ATOM WHO STROVE TO OPEN THEM
3486-166446-0041 IN IT SOMETHING OMINOUS SOMETHING SINISTER IT SWELLED TO A CRESCENDO ABRUPTLY CEASED AND NOW I SAW NORHALA RAISE HER HEAD LISTEN I SAW A WORLD A VAST WORLD GOODWIN MARCHING STATELY THROUGH SPACE
3486-166446-0042 IT WAS NO GLOBE IT WAS A WORLD OF MANY FACETS OF SMOOTH AND POLISHED PLANES
3526-175658-0000 PERMISSION TO ACCEPT SUCH ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT SHOULD IT OFFER HAVING FORMED AN ARTICLE OF THE TERMS ON WHICH HE HAD ENGAGED ME IT WAS THEREFORE ARRANGED IN THE COURSE OF NEXT DAY
3526-175658-0001 WHEN EVENING CAME I PREPARED TO STEP OVER IN ORDER TO SEEK A CONFERENCE WITH MADEMOISELLE HERSELF ON THE SUBJECT I HAD NOT HAD TIME TO PAY THE VISIT BEFORE HAVING BEEN ALL DAY CLOSELY OCCUPIED IN CLASS
3526-175658-0003 SHE IS SOME STIFF OLD MAID FOR THOUGH THE DAUGHTER OF MADAME REUTER SHE MAY WELL NUMBER UPWARDS OF FORTY WINTERS BESIDES IF IT WERE OTHERWISE IF SHE BE BOTH YOUNG AND PRETTY I AM NOT HANDSOME
3526-175658-0004 AND NO DRESSING CAN MAKE ME SO THEREFORE I'LL GO AS I AM AND OFF I STARTED CURSORILY GLANCING SIDEWAYS AS I PASSED THE TOILET TABLE SURMOUNTED BY A LOOKING GLASS A THIN IRREGULAR FACE I SAW
3526-175658-0006 IN A MOMENT I HAD PULLED THE BELL IN ANOTHER MOMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND WITHIN APPEARED A PASSAGE PAVED ALTERNATELY WITH BLACK AND WHITE MARBLE THE WALLS WERE PAINTED IN IMITATION OF MARBLE ALSO AND AT THE FAR END OPENED A GLASS DOOR
3526-175658-0007 THROUGH WHICH I SAW SHRUBS AND A GRASS PLAT LOOKING PLEASANT IN THE SUNSHINE OF THE MILD SPRING EVENING FOR IT WAS NOW THE MIDDLE OF APRIL THIS THEN WAS MY FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN BUT I HAD NOT TIME TO LOOK LONG
3526-175658-0009 WITH A VERY WELL PAINTED HIGHLY VARNISHED FLOOR CHAIRS AND SOFAS COVERED WITH WHITE DRAPERIES A GREEN PORCELAIN STOVE WALLS HUNG WITH PICTURES IN GILT FRAMES A GILT PENDULE AND OTHER ORNAMENTS ON THE MANTELPIECE
3526-175658-0010 A LARGE LUSTRE PENDENT FROM THE CENTRE OF THE CEILING MIRRORS CONSOLES MUSLIN CURTAINS AND A HANDSOME CENTRE TABLE COMPLETED THE INVENTORY OF FURNITURE ALL LOOKED EXTREMELY CLEAN AND GLITTERING
3526-175658-0012 THIS ROOM WAS CARPETED AND THEREIN WAS A PIANO A COUCH A CHIFFONNIERE
3526-175658-0013 WHICH BEING UNDRAWN AFFORDED ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF THE GARDEN THROUGH THE LARGE CLEAR PANES ROUND WHICH SOME LEAVES OF IVY SOME TENDRILS OF VINE WERE TRAINED
3526-175658-0015 YES SHE SAID SHE OFTEN THOUGHT SO AND ADDED
3526-175658-0016 BUT YOU SEE I COULD NOT TAKE MY GARDEN WITH ME AND I SHOULD SCARCELY FIND ONE SO LARGE AND PLEASANT ANYWHERE ELSE IN TOWN I APPROVED HER JUDGMENT BUT YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET SAID SHE RISING
3526-175658-0018 NOT VERY BROAD STRIP OF CULTURED GROUND WITH AN ALLEY BORDERED BY ENORMOUS OLD FRUIT TREES DOWN THE MIDDLE THERE WAS A SORT OF LAWN A PARTERRE OF ROSE TREES SOME FLOWER BORDERS AND ON THE FAR SIDE
3526-175658-0019 IT LOOKED PLEASANT TO ME VERY PLEASANT SO LONG A TIME HAD ELAPSED SINCE I HAD SEEN A GARDEN OF ANY SORT
3526-175658-0021 WHO MIGHT INDEED BE OLDER THAN I BUT WAS STILL YOUNG SHE COULD NOT I THOUGHT BE MORE THAN SIX OR SEVEN AND TWENTY SHE WAS AS FAIR AS A FAIR ENGLISHWOMAN SHE HAD NO CAP HER HAIR WAS NUT BROWN AND SHE WORE IT IN CURLS
3526-175658-0022 PRETTY HER FEATURES WERE NOT NOR VERY SOFT NOR VERY REGULAR BUT NEITHER WERE THEY IN ANY DEGREE PLAIN AND I ALREADY SAW CAUSE TO DEEM THEM EXPRESSIVE WHAT WAS THEIR PREDOMINANT CAST
3526-175658-0024 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE WISDOM OF THE STEP SHE WAS ABOUT TO TAKE BECAUSE I WAS SO YOUNG AND PARENTS MIGHT POSSIBLY OBJECT TO A PROFESSOR LIKE ME FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IT IS OFTEN WELL TO ACT ON ONE'S OWN JUDGMENT SAID SHE
3526-175658-0025 AND TO LEAD PARENTS RATHER THAN BE LED BY THEM THE FITNESS OF A PROFESSOR IS NOT A MATTER OF AGE AND FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD AND FROM WHAT I OBSERVE MYSELF
3526-175658-0027 THE SURVEILLANCE WILL BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO AND THEN SHE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS THE SUBJECT OF TERMS SHE WAS VERY CAUTIOUS QUITE ON HER GUARD SHE DID NOT ABSOLUTELY BARGAIN BUT SHE WARILY SOUNDED ME TO FIND OUT WHAT MY EXPECTATIONS MIGHT BE
3526-175658-0028 AND WHEN SHE COULD NOT GET ME TO NAME A SUM SHE REASONED AND REASONED WITH A FLUENT YET QUIET CIRCUMLOCUTION OF SPEECH AND AT LAST NAILED ME DOWN TO FIVE HUNDRED FRANCS PER ANNUM NOT TOO MUCH BUT I AGREED
3526-175658-0030 THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE EVINCED MORE COARSENESS AND URGENCY AND THEN SHE HAD SO MANY REASONS SO MANY EXPLANATIONS AND AFTER ALL SHE SUCCEEDED IN PROVING HERSELF QUITE DISINTERESTED AND EVEN LIBERAL AT LAST SHE CONCLUDED SHE COULD SAY NO MORE
3526-175658-0031 BECAUSE AS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL THINGS THERE WAS NO FURTHER GROUND FOR THE EXERCISE OF HER PARTS OF SPEECH I WAS OBLIGED TO RISE I WOULD RATHER HAVE SAT A LITTLE LONGER WHAT HAD I TO RETURN TO BUT MY SMALL EMPTY ROOM
3526-175658-0033 WHEN I ROSE TO GO I HELD OUT MY HAND ON PURPOSE THOUGH I KNEW IT WAS CONTRARY TO THE ETIQUETTE OF FOREIGN HABITS SHE SMILED AND SAID AH
3526-175658-0034 AND WITH THE SORT OF TRANQUILLITY OBVIOUS IN ALL SHE DID A TRANQUILLITY WHICH SOOTHED AND SUITED ME SINGULARLY AT LEAST I THOUGHT SO THAT EVENING BRUSSELS SEEMED A VERY PLEASANT PLACE TO ME WHEN I GOT OUT AGAIN INTO THE STREET
3526-176651-0000 AND HER DEEP EYES FIXED ON THE SMOKE IN THE VALLEY BELOW HER BREATH WAS STILL COMING FAST BETWEEN HER PARTED LIPS THERE WERE TINY DROPS ALONG THE ROOTS OF HER SHINING HAIR FOR THE CLIMB HAD BEEN STEEP
3526-176651-0001 AS ON THE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE STEEPS BELOW HER BEYOND THEM WAS A GAP IN THE NEXT MOUNTAIN CHAIN AND DOWN IN THE LITTLE VALLEY JUST VISIBLE THROUGH IT WERE TRAILING BLUE MISTS AS WELL AND SHE KNEW
3526-176651-0003 AND TOSSED BACK ROLLING BLACK PLUMES ALL STREAKED WITH FIRE FOR MANY DAYS NOW SHE HAD HEARD STORIES OF THE FURRINERS WHO HAD COME INTO THOSE HILLS AND WERE DOING STRANGE THINGS DOWN THERE AND SO AT LAST
3526-176651-0004 SHE HAD CLIMBED UP THROUGH THE DEWY MORNING FROM THE COVE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO SEE THE WONDERS FOR HERSELF SHE HAD NEVER BEEN UP THERE BEFORE SHE HAD NO BUSINESS THERE NOW AND IF SHE WERE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT BACK
3526-176651-0006 IT WAS A BIG WORLD THOUGH THAT WAS SPREAD BEFORE HER AND A VAGUE AWE OF IT SEIZED HER STRAIGHTWAY AND HELD HER MOTIONLESS AND DREAMING BEYOND THOSE WHITE MISTS TRAILING UP THE HILLS
3526-176651-0007 BEYOND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTING IN THE VALLEY THOSE LIMITLESS BLUE WAVES MUST RUN UNDER THE SUN ON AND ON TO THE END OF THE WORLD HER DEAD SISTER HAD GONE INTO THAT FAR SILENCE
3526-176651-0009 MOVED SLOWLY TO THE CLIFF THAT DROPPED SHEER TEN FEET ASIDE FROM THE TRAIL AND STOOD THERE LIKE A GREAT SCARLET FLOWER IN STILL AIR THERE WAS THE WAY AT HER FEET
3526-176651-0010 THAT PATH THAT COILED UNDER THE CLIFF AND RAN DOWN LOOP BY LOOP THROUGH MAJESTIC OAK AND POPLAR AND MASSES OF RHODODENDRON SHE DREW A LONG BREATH AND STIRRED UNEASILY
3526-176651-0012 WRITHING THIS WAY AND THAT TO A SPUR THAT HAD BEEN SWEPT BARE BY FOREST FIRES ALONG THIS SPUR IT TRAVELLED STRAIGHT FOR A WHILE AND AS HER EYES EAGERLY FOLLOWED IT TO WHERE IT SANK SHARPLY INTO A COVERT OF MAPLES
3526-176651-0013 THE LITTLE CREATURE DROPPED OF A SUDDEN TO THE GROUND AND LIKE SOMETHING WILD LAY FLAT A HUMAN FIGURE HAD FILLED THE LEAFY MOUTH THAT SWALLOWED UP THE TRAIL AND IT WAS COMING TOWARDS HER
3526-176651-0015 LIKE A CROUCHED PANTHER CUB LOOKING DOWN FOR A MOMENT ALL THAT WAS HUMAN SEEMED GONE FROM HER EYES BUT AS SHE WATCHED ALL THAT WAS LOST CAME BACK TO THEM
3526-176651-0016 AND SOMETHING MORE SHE HAD SEEN THAT IT WAS A MAN BUT SHE HAD DROPPED SO QUICKLY THAT SHE DID NOT SEE THE BIG BLACK HORSE
3526-176651-0018 SHE HAD NEVER SEEN A MAN LIKE THAT BEFORE HIS FACE WAS SMOOTH AND LOOKED DIFFERENT AS DID HIS THROAT AND HIS HANDS HIS BREECHES WERE TIGHT
3526-176651-0019 WHICH WAS DEEP IN SEAT HIGH BOTH IN FRONT AND BEHIND AND HAD STRANGE LONG HOODED STIRRUPS STARTING TO MOUNT THE MAN STOPPED WITH ONE FOOT IN THE STIRRUP AND RAISED HIS EYES TOWARDS HER SO SUDDENLY THAT SHE SHRANK BACK AGAIN
3526-176651-0021 SHE SAW HANGING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SADDLE SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A GUN HE WAS A RAIDER THAT MAN SO CAUTIOUSLY AND SWIFTLY THEN SHE PUSHED HERSELF BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE CLIFF
3526-176651-0022 SPRANG TO HER FEET DASHED PAST THE BIG TREE AND WINGED WITH FEAR SPED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN LEAVING IN A SPOT OF SUNLIGHT AT THE BASE OF THE PINE
3526-176653-0001 BUT THERE WAS NO SOUND IN THE AIR BUT THE FOOTFALLS OF HIS HORSE AND THE EASY CREAKING OF LEATHER UNDER HIM THE DRIP OF DEW OVERHEAD AND THE RUNNING OF WATER BELOW NOW AND THEN HE COULD SEE THE SAME SLENDER FOOT PRINTS IN THE RICH LOAM
3526-176653-0002 AND HE SAW THEM IN THE SAND WHERE THE FIRST TINY BROOK TINKLED ACROSS THE PATH FROM A GLOOMY RAVINE THERE THE LITTLE CREATURE HAD TAKEN A FLYING LEAP ACROSS IT AND BEYOND HE COULD SEE THE PRINTS NO MORE HE LITTLE GUESSED THAT WHILE HE HALTED TO LET HIS HORSE DRINK
3526-176653-0004 PUSHING THE NET IN FRONT OF HIM HE WAS A RAIDER SURE SHE THOUGHT NOW AND HE WAS LOOKING FOR A MOONSHINE STILL AND THE WILD LITTLE THING IN THE BUSHES SMILED CUNNINGLY THERE WAS NO STILL UP THAT CREEK
3526-176653-0005 AND AS HE HAD LEFT HIS HORSE BELOW AND HIS GUN SHE WAITED FOR HIM TO COME BACK WHICH HE DID BY AND BY DRIPPING AND SOAKED TO HIS KNEES THEN SHE SAW HIM UNTIE THE QUEER GUN ON HIS SADDLE PULL IT OUT OF A CASE AND
3526-176653-0007 HOW COULD HE GET A FISH OUT WITH THAT LITTLE SWITCH SHE THOUGHT CONTEMPTUOUSLY BY AND BY SOMETHING HUMMED QUEERLY THE MAN GAVE A SLIGHT JERK AND A SHINING FISH FLOPPED TWO FEET INTO THE AIR IT WAS SURELY VERY QUEER
3526-176653-0008 BUT STOOD STILL WINDING SOMETHING WITH ONE HAND AND AGAIN THE FISH WOULD FLASH INTO THE AIR AND THEN THAT HUMMING WOULD START AGAIN WHILE THE FISHERMAN WOULD STAND QUIET AND WAITING FOR A WHILE AND THEN HE WOULD BEGIN TO WIND AGAIN IN HER WONDER
3526-176653-0010 HE LOOKED UP AND SMILED AND SHE HAD SEEN NO SMILE LIKE THAT BEFORE HOWDYE LITTLE GIRL ONE BARE TOE WENT BURROWING SUDDENLY INTO THE SAND ONE FINGER WENT TO HER RED MOUTH AND THAT WAS ALL
3526-176653-0011 AND HE SMILED AGAIN CAT GOT YOUR TONGUE HER EYES FELL AT THE ANCIENT BANTER BUT SHE LIFTED THEM STRAIGHTWAY AND STARED AGAIN YOU LIVE AROUND HERE SHE STARED ON
3526-176653-0013 THE STEADY EYES LEAPED ANGRILY BUT THERE WAS STILL NO ANSWER AND HE BENT TO TAKE THE FISH OFF HIS HOOK PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW TURNED HIS BACK AND TOSSED IT INTO THE POOL HIT HAIN'T HE LOOKED UP AGAIN
3526-176653-0014 HIS LINE RANG SUDDENLY JACK SHE CRIED YOU GOT A BITE HE PULLED MISSED THE STRIKE AND WOUND IN THE MINNOW WAS ALL RIGHT SO HE TOSSED IT BACK AGAIN THAT ISN'T YOUR NAME HE SAID
3526-176653-0016 AND THE FISHERMAN WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD ARIGHT JUNE THE LITTLE GIRL GAVE A SHRILL ANSWERING CRY BUT SHE DID NOT MOVE THAR NOW SHE SAID WHO'S THAT YOUR MAMMY NO TAIN'T
3526-176653-0017 HIT'S MY STEP MAMMY I'M A GOIN TO KETCH HELL NOW HER INNOCENT EYES TURNED SULLEN AND HER BABY MOUTH TIGHTENED GOOD LORD SAID THE FISHERMAN STARTLED AND THEN HE STOPPED THE WORDS WERE AS INNOCENT ON HER LIPS AS A BENEDICTION
3526-176653-0019 DRAWLED A VOICE FROM THE BUSHES AND IT HAD A TONE THAT MADE THE FISHERMAN WHIRL SUDDENLY A GIANT MOUNTAINEER STOOD ON THE BANK ABOVE HIM WITH A WINCHESTER IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS ARM HOW ARE YOU
3526-176653-0020 THE GIANT'S HEAVY EYES LIFTED QUICKLY BUT HE SPOKE TO THE GIRL YOU GO ON HOME
3526-176653-0022 THE LITTLE CREATURE VANISHED AND THE MOUNTAINEER TURNED TO THE FISHERMAN WHO HAD JUST PUT ON A FRESH MINNOW AND TOSSED IT INTO THE RIVER PURTY WELL THANK YOU HE SAID SHORTLY HOW ARE YOU FINE WAS THE NONCHALANT ANSWER
3526-176653-0023 FOR A MOMENT THERE WAS SILENCE AND A PUZZLED FROWN GATHERED ON THE MOUNTAINEER'S FACE THAT'S A BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL OF YOURS
3526-176653-0025 THE MOUNTAINEER'S BUSHY BROWS CAME TOGETHER ACROSS THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE AND HIS VOICE RUMBLED LIKE DISTANT THUNDER WHAT'S YO NAME STRANGER AN WHAT'S YO BUSINESS OVER HYEH DEAR ME THERE YOU GO YOU CAN SEE I'M FISHING
3526-176653-0026 BUT WHY DOES EVERYBODY IN THESE MOUNTAINS WANT TO KNOW MY NAME YOU HEERD ME YES THE FISHERMAN TURNED AGAIN AND SAW THE GIANT'S RUGGED FACE STERN AND PALE WITH OPEN ANGER NOW
3526-176653-0028 I MIGHT HAVE A GUN MYSELF SOMETIMES DID YOU THINK YOU COULD SCARE ME THE MOUNTAINEER STARED IN GENUINE SURPRISE TWUSN'T NO JOKE HE SAID SHORTLY

3526-176653-0031 AND THE OLD MAN WENT ON WITH A SHAKE OF HIS HEAD HE'LL COME HE SAID TO HIMSELF OH HE'LL COME THAT VERY POINT HALE WAS DEBATING WITH HIMSELF AS HE UNAVAILINGLY CAST HIS MINNOW INTO THE SWIFT WATER AND SLOWLY WOUND IT IN AGAIN
3526-176653-0032 HOW DID THAT OLD MAN KNOW HIS NAME AND WOULD THE OLD SAVAGE REALLY HAVE HURT HIM HAD HE NOT FOUND OUT WHO HE WAS THE LITTLE GIRL WAS A WONDER EVIDENTLY SHE HAD MUFFLED HIS LAST NAME ON PURPOSE NOT KNOWING IT HERSELF
3526-176653-0034 HE LIKED THAT AND HER HAIR IT WAS EXACTLY LIKE THE GOLD BRONZE ON THE WING OF A WILD TURKEY THAT HE HAD SHOT THE DAY BEFORE WELL IT WAS NOON NOW THE FISH HAD STOPPED BITING AFTER THE WAYWARD FASHION OF BASS
3526-176653-0035 HE WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND HE WOULD GO UP AND SEE THE LITTLE GIRL AND THE GIANT AGAIN AND GET THAT PROMISED DRAM ONCE MORE HOWEVER HE LET HIS MINNOW FLOAT DOWN INTO THE SHADOW OF A BIG ROCK
3526-176653-0037 ONLY ONE ANSWERED HALE WITH EQUAL CHEER THE OLD WOMAN PUSHED BACK HER BONNET AS HE WADED THROUGH THE WATER TOWARDS THEM AND HE SAW THAT SHE WAS PUFFING A CLAY PIPE SHE LOOKED AT THE FISHERMAN AND HIS TACKLE WITH THE NAIVE WONDER OF A CHILD
3526-176653-0038 AND THEN SHE SAID IN A COMMANDING UNDERTONE GO ON BILLY
3526-176653-0040 SAID THE OLD MAN CHUCKLING BUT THAR'S A SIGHT OF EM DOWN THAR BELOW MY OLD MILL QUIETLY THE OLD WOMAN HIT THE HORSE WITH A STRIPPED BRANCH OF ELM AND THE OLD GRAY WITH A SWITCH OF HIS TAIL STARTED

3526-176653-0044 WHEN HE GOT TO THE BARE CREST OF A LITTLE RISE HE COULD SEE UP THE CREEK A SPIRAL OF BLUE RISING SWIFTLY FROM A STONE CHIMNEY GEESE AND DUCKS WERE HUNTING CRAWFISH IN THE LITTLE CREEK THAT RAN FROM A MILK HOUSE OF LOGS
3526-176653-0046 GEE HAW I TELL YE AN OX WAGON EVIDENTLY WAS COMING ON AND THE ROAD WAS SO NARROW THAT HE TURNED HIS HORSE INTO THE BUSHES TO LET IT PASS
3526-176653-0047 STILL THERE WAS NO SOUND OF OX OR WAGON AND THE VOICE SOUNDED LIKE A CHILD'S SO HE WENT ON AT A WALK IN THE THICK SAND AND WHEN HE TURNED THE BUSHES HE PULLED UP AGAIN WITH A LOW LAUGH
3526-176653-0049 THE BOY WAS USING THE SWITCH AS A GOAD AND DRIVING THE FROG AS AN OX AND HE WAS AS EARNEST AS THOUGH BOTH WERE REAL I GIVE YE A LITTLE REST NOW BUCK HE SAID SHAKING HIS HEAD EARNESTLY
3526-176653-0050 GEE GEE THE FROG HOPPED SEVERAL TIMES

3526-176653-0053 WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT DAGGER THE BOY'S BREAST HEAVED AND HIS DIRTY FINGERS CLENCHED TIGHT AROUND THE WHITTLED STICK DON'T YOU TALK TO ME THAT A WAY HE SAID WITH AN OMINOUS SHAKE OF HIS HEAD I'LL GUT YE THE FISHERMAN THREW BACK HIS HEAD
3607-29116-0000 LAURA WENT DOWN STAIRS KNOCKED AT THE STUDY DOOR AND ENTERED SCARCELY WAITING FOR THE RESPONSE SENATOR DILWORTHY WAS ALONE WITH AN OPEN BIBLE IN HIS HAND UPSIDE DOWN LAURA SMILED AND SAID FORGETTING HER ACQUIRED CORRECTNESS OF SPEECH IT IS ONLY ME
3607-29116-0001 AH COME IN SIT DOWN AND THE SENATOR CLOSED THE BOOK AND LAID IT DOWN I WANTED TO SEE YOU

3607-29116-0009 I HAVE NO CONCEALMENTS FROM YOU BUT I HAVE ONE PRINCIPLE IN MY PUBLIC LIFE WHICH I SHOULD LIKE YOU TO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GUIDE I NEVER PUSH A PRIVATE INTEREST IF IT IS NOT JUSTIFIED AND ENNOBLED BY SOME LARGER PUBLIC GOOD
3607-29116-0010 IF IT WAS NOT TO AID IN THE SALVATION OF HIS FELLOW MEN THE SENATOR SPOKE WITH FEELING AND THEN ADDED I HOPE YOU SHOWED HOPPERSON THAT OUR MOTIVES WERE PURE YES AND HE SEEMED TO HAVE A NEW LIGHT ON THE MEASURE I THINK WILL VOTE FOR IT
3607-29116-0012 THAT'S GOOD THAT'S GOOD SAID THE SENATOR SMILING AND RUBBING HIS HANDS IS THERE ANYTHING MORE YOU'LL FIND SOME CHANGES IN THAT I GUESS HANDING THE SENATOR A PRINTED LIST OF NAMES THOSE CHECKED OFF ARE ALL RIGHT AH M M

3607-29116-0016 OH I SAW SENATOR BALLOON HE WILL HELP US I SUPPOSE BALLOON IS A WHOLE HEARTED FELLOW I CAN'T HELP LOVING THAT MAN FOR ALL HIS DROLLERY AND WAGGISHNESS HE PUTS ON AN AIR OF LEVITY SOMETIMES BUT THERE AINT A MAN IN THE SENATE KNOWS THE SCRIPTURES AS HE DOES
3607-29116-0018 THE SENATOR LAUGHED BUT RATHER FEEBLY AND SAID BALLOON IS ALWAYS FULL OF HIS JOKES I EXPLAINED IT TO HIM HE SAID IT WAS ALL RIGHT HE ONLY WANTED A WORD WITH YOU CONTINUED LAURA HE IS A HANDSOME OLD GENTLEMAN AND HE IS GALLANT FOR AN OLD MAN
3607-29116-0019 MY DAUGHTER SAID THE SENATOR WITH A GRAVE LOOK I TRUST THERE WAS NOTHING FREE IN HIS MANNER FREE REPEATED LAURA WITH INDIGNATION IN HER FACE WITH ME THERE THERE CHILD I MEANT NOTHING BALLOON TALKS A LITTLE FREELY SOMETIMES WITH MEN
3607-29116-0021 I SUPPOSE HE WILL PAINT PUB DOCS ON THEM AND FRANK THEM HOME THAT'S GOOD ECONOMY ISN'T IT YES YES BUT CHILD ALL CONGRESSMEN DO THAT IT MAY NOT BE STRICTLY HONEST INDEED IT IS NOT UNLESS HE HAD SOME PUBLIC DOCUMENTS MIXED IN WITH THE CLOTHES
3607-29116-0022 IT'S A FUNNY WORLD GOOD BYE UNCLE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT CHAIRMAN AND HUMMING A CHEERY OPERA AIR SHE DEPARTED TO HER ROOM TO DRESS FOR GOING OUT BEFORE SHE DID THAT HOWEVER SHE TOOK OUT HER NOTE BOOK AND WAS SOON DEEP IN ITS CONTENTS MARKING DASHING
3607-29116-0024 WOULDN'T DILWORTHY OPEN HIS EYES IF HE KNEW SOME OF THE THINGS BALLOON DID SAY TO ME THERE HOPPERSON'S INFLUENCE OUGHT TO COUNT TWENTY THE SANCTIMONIOUS OLD CURMUDGEON SON IN LAW SINECURE IN THE NEGRO INSTITUTION THAT ABOUT GAUGES HIM THE THREE COMMITTEEMEN
3607-29116-0025 SONS IN LAW NOTHING LIKE A SON IN LAW HERE IN WASHINGTON OR A BROTHER IN LAW AND EVERYBODY HAS EM LET'S SEE SIXTY ONE WITH PLACES TWENTY FIVE PERSUADED IT IS GETTING ON WE'LL HAVE TWO THIRDS OF CONGRESS IN TIME DILWORTHY MUST SURELY KNOW I UNDERSTAND HIM
3607-29116-0027 SEEMED TO BE IN LOVE I WAS SURE OF IT HE PROMISED TO COME HERE AND HE HASN'T STRANGE VERY STRANGE I MUST CHANCE TO MEET HIM TO DAY LAURA DRESSED AND WENT OUT THINKING SHE WAS PERHAPS TOO EARLY FOR MISTER BUCKSTONE TO COME FROM THE HOUSE
3607-29116-0028 BUT AS HE LODGED NEAR THE BOOKSTORE SHE WOULD DROP IN THERE AND KEEP A LOOK OUT FOR HIM WHILE LAURA IS ON HER ERRAND TO FIND MISTER BUCKSTONE IT MAY NOT BE OUT OF THE WAY TO REMARK THAT SHE KNEW QUITE AS MUCH OF WASHINGTON LIFE AS SENATOR DILWORTHY GAVE HER CREDIT FOR
3607-29116-0030 THEY WERE ALWAYS TALKING IN THE ROW EVERLASTINGLY GOSSIPING BANTERING AND SARCASTICALLY PRAISING THINGS AND GOING ON IN A STYLE WHICH WAS A CURIOUS COMMINGLING OF EARNEST AND PERSIFLAGE COLONEL SELLERS LIKED THIS TALK AMAZINGLY THOUGH HE WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE AT SEA IN IT
3607-29116-0031 AND PERHAPS THAT DIDN'T LESSEN THE RELISH OF THE CONVERSATION TO THE CORRESPONDENTS IT SEEMS THAT THEY HAD GOT HOLD OF THE DRY GOODS BOX PACKING STORY ABOUT BALLOON ONE DAY AND WERE TALKING IT OVER WHEN THE COLONEL CAME IN THE COLONEL WANTED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT IT AND HICKS TOLD HIM
3607-29116-0033 YES I SUPPOSE IT'S SO WELL SENATOR BALLOON PUT FIFTEEN CENTS WORTH OF STAMPS ON EACH OF THOSE SEVEN HUGE BOXES OF OLD CLOTHES AND SHIPPED THAT TON OF SECOND HAND RUBBISH OLD BOOTS AND PANTALOONS AND WHAT NOT THROUGH THE MAILS AS REGISTERED MATTER
3607-29116-0034 IT WAS AN INGENIOUS THING AND IT HAD A GENUINE TOUCH OF HUMOR ABOUT IT TOO I THINK THERE IS MORE REAL TALENT AMONG OUR PUBLIC MEN OF TO DAY THAN THERE WAS AMONG THOSE OF OLD TIMES A FAR MORE FERTILE FANCY A MUCH HAPPIER INGENUITY
3607-29116-0036 I HAVE A MUCH GREATER ADMIRATION FOR SENATOR BALLOON YES BALLOON IS A MAN OF PARTS THERE IS NO DENYING IT I THINK SO HE IS SPOKEN OF FOR THE POST OF MINISTER TO CHINA OR AUSTRIA AND I HOPE WILL BE APPOINTED
3607-29116-0037 WHAT WE WANT ABROAD IS GOOD EXAMPLES OF THE NATIONAL CHARACTER JOHN JAY AND BENJAMIN FRANKLIN WERE WELL ENOUGH IN THEIR DAY BUT THE NATION HAS MADE PROGRESS SINCE THEN BALLOON IS A MAN WE KNOW AND CAN DEPEND ON TO BE TRUE TO HIMSELF
3607-29116-0039 WHOSE LAND HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THEM BY THE WHITE MAN IN THE INTERESTS OF CIVILIZATION BUT BALLOON KNEW THEIR NEEDS BETTER HE BUILT A GOVERNMENT SAW MILL ON THE RESERVATION WITH THE MONEY AND THE LUMBER SOLD FOR ENORMOUS PRICES A RELATIVE OF HIS DID ALL THE WORK FREE OF CHARGE
3607-29116-0040 THAT IS TO SAY HE CHARGED NOTHING MORE THAN THE LUMBER WOULD BRING BUT THE POOR INJUNS NOT THAT I CARE MUCH FOR INJUNS WHAT DID HE DO FOR THEM GAVE THEM THE OUTSIDE SLABS TO FENCE IN THE RESERVATION WITH GOVERNOR BALLOON WAS NOTHING LESS THAN A FATHER TO THE POOR INDIANS BUT BALLOON IS NOT ALONE
3607-29116-0042 OF SECURING THEIR SERVICES FEW LANDS ARE SO BLEST THAT IS TRUE COLONEL TO BE SURE YOU CAN BUY NOW AND THEN A SENATOR OR A REPRESENTATIVE BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW IT IS WRONG AND SO THEY ARE NOT ASHAMED OF IT THEY ARE GENTLE AND CONFIDING AND CHILDLIKE
3607-29116-0043 AND IN MY OPINION THESE ARE QUALITIES THAT ENNOBLE THEM FAR MORE THAN ANY AMOUNT OF
3607-29116-0045 HEAVEN PROTECT ME FROM SUCH A CHARGE THAT IS WHAT DILWORTHY SAID AND YET WHEN YOU COME TO LOOK AT IT YOU CANNOT DENY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF SOME OF OUR ABLEST MEN SIR IF THE COUNTRY WERE OPPOSED TO TO BRIBERY IT IS A HARSH TERM I DO NOT LIKE TO USE IT
3607-135982-0000 THE CARS CAME SCUDDING IN TOWARDS DUBLIN RUNNING EVENLY LIKE PELLETS IN THE GROOVE OF THE NAAS ROAD
3607-135982-0002 THE CARS OF THEIR FRIENDS THE FRENCH THE FRENCH MOREOVER WERE VIRTUAL VICTORS THEIR TEAM HAD FINISHED SOLIDLY THEY HAD BEEN PLACED SECOND AND THIRD AND THE DRIVER OF THE WINNING GERMAN CAR WAS REPORTED A BELGIAN
3607-135982-0003 EACH BLUE CAR THEREFORE RECEIVED A DOUBLE MEASURE OF WELCOME AS IT TOPPED THE CREST OF THE HILL AND EACH CHEER OF WELCOME WAS ACKNOWLEDGED WITH SMILES AND NODS BY THOSE IN THE CAR IN ONE OF THESE TRIMLY BUILT CARS WAS A PARTY OF FOUR YOUNG MEN WHOSE SPIRITS SEEMED TO BE AT PRESENT
3607-135982-0005 AND A NEATLY GROOMED YOUNG MAN NAMED DOYLE SEGOUIN WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD UNEXPECTEDLY RECEIVED SOME ORDERS IN ADVANCE HE WAS ABOUT TO START A MOTOR ESTABLISHMENT IN PARIS
3607-135982-0006 AND RIVIERE WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE WAS TO BE APPOINTED MANAGER OF THE ESTABLISHMENT THESE TWO YOUNG MEN WHO WERE COUSINS WERE ALSO IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE FRENCH CARS VILLONA WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR BECAUSE HE HAD HAD A VERY SATISFACTORY LUNCHEON
3607-135982-0008 HIS FATHER WHO HAD BEGUN LIFE AS AN ADVANCED NATIONALIST HAD MODIFIED HIS VIEWS EARLY HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY AS A BUTCHER IN KINGSTOWN AND BY OPENING SHOPS IN DUBLIN AND IN THE SUBURBS HE HAD MADE HIS MONEY MANY TIMES OVER
3607-135982-0009 HE HAD ALSO BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME OF THE POLICE CONTRACTS AND IN THE END HE HAD BECOME RICH ENOUGH TO BE ALLUDED TO IN THE DUBLIN NEWSPAPERS AS A MERCHANT PRINCE HE HAD SENT HIS SON TO ENGLAND TO BE EDUCATED IN A BIG CATHOLIC COLLEGE
3607-135982-0011 HIS FATHER REMONSTRATIVE BUT COVERTLY PROUD OF THE EXCESS HAD PAID HIS BILLS AND BROUGHT HIM HOME
3607-135982-0012 WHO HAD SEEN SO MUCH OF THE WORLD AND WAS REPUTED TO OWN SOME OF THE BIGGEST HOTELS IN FRANCE SUCH A PERSON AS HIS FATHER AGREED WAS WELL WORTH KNOWING EVEN IF HE HAD NOT BEEN THE CHARMING COMPANION HE WAS
3607-135982-0014 DECIDEDLY VILLONA WAS IN EXCELLENT SPIRITS HE KEPT UP A DEEP BASS HUM OF MELODY FOR MILES OF THE ROAD THE FRENCHMEN FLUNG THEIR LAUGHTER AND LIGHT WORDS OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AND OFTEN JIMMY HAD TO STRAIN FORWARD TO CATCH THE QUICK PHRASE
3607-135982-0015 THIS WAS NOT ALTOGETHER PLEASANT FOR HIM AS HE HAD NEARLY ALWAYS TO MAKE A DEFT GUESS AT THE MEANING AND SHOUT BACK A SUITABLE ANSWER IN THE FACE OF A HIGH WIND BESIDES VILLONA'S HUMMING WOULD CONFUSE ANYBODY THE NOISE OF THE CAR TOO
3607-135982-0017 AT THE CONTROL SEGOUIN HAD PRESENTED HIM TO ONE OF THE FRENCH COMPETITORS AND IN ANSWER TO HIS CONFUSED MURMUR OF COMPLIMENT THE SWARTHY FACE OF THE DRIVER HAD DISCLOSED A LINE OF SHINING WHITE TEETH
3607-135982-0018 IT WAS PLEASANT AFTER THAT HONOUR TO RETURN TO THE PROFANE WORLD OF SPECTATORS AMID NUDGES AND SIGNIFICANT LOOKS THEN AS TO MONEY HE REALLY HAD A GREAT SUM UNDER HIS CONTROL
3607-135982-0020 AND IF HE HAD BEEN SO CONSCIOUS OF THE LABOUR LATENT IN MONEY WHEN THERE HAD BEEN QUESTION MERELY OF SOME FREAK OF THE HIGHER INTELLIGENCE HOW MUCH MORE SO NOW WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO STAKE THE GREATER PART OF HIS SUBSTANCE IT WAS A SERIOUS THING FOR HIM
3607-135982-0021 JIMMY HAD A RESPECT FOR HIS FATHER'S SHREWDNESS IN BUSINESS MATTERS AND IN THIS CASE IT HAD BEEN HIS FATHER WHO HAD FIRST SUGGESTED THE INVESTMENT MONEY TO BE MADE IN THE MOTOR BUSINESS POTS OF MONEY MOREOVER SEGOUIN HAD THE UNMISTAKABLE AIR OF WEALTH
3607-135982-0023 AND GALLANTLY THE MACHINERY OF HUMAN NERVES STROVE TO ANSWER THE BOUNDING COURSES OF THE SWIFT BLUE ANIMAL THEY DROVE DOWN DAME STREET THE STREET WAS BUSY WITH UNUSUAL TRAFFIC LOUD WITH THE HORNS OF MOTORISTS AND THE GONGS OF IMPATIENT TRAM DRIVERS
3607-135982-0024 NEAR THE BANK SEGOUIN DREW UP AND JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND ALIGHTED A LITTLE KNOT OF PEOPLE COLLECTED ON THE FOOTPATH TO PAY HOMAGE TO THE SNORTING MOTOR THE PARTY WAS TO DINE TOGETHER THAT EVENING IN SEGOUIN'S HOTEL AND MEANWHILE JIMMY AND HIS FRIEND WHO WAS STAYING WITH HIM
3607-135982-0026 IN A HAZE OF SUMMER EVENING IN JIMMY'S HOUSE THIS DINNER HAD BEEN PRONOUNCED AN OCCASION A CERTAIN PRIDE MINGLED WITH HIS PARENTS TREPIDATION A CERTAIN EAGERNESS ALSO TO PLAY FAST AND LOOSE FOR THE NAMES OF GREAT FOREIGN CITIES HAVE AT LEAST THIS VIRTUE
3607-135982-0027 AND AS HE STOOD IN THE HALL GIVING A LAST EQUATION TO THE BOWS OF HIS DRESS TIE HIS FATHER MAY HAVE FELT EVEN COMMERCIALLY SATISFIED AT HAVING SECURED FOR HIS SON QUALITIES OFTEN UNPURCHASEABLE HIS FATHER THEREFORE WAS UNUSUALLY FRIENDLY WITH VILLONA
3607-135982-0029 SEGOUIN JIMMY DECIDED HAD A VERY REFINED TASTE THE PARTY WAS INCREASED BY A YOUNG ENGLISHMAN NAMED ROUTH WHOM JIMMY HAD SEEN WITH SEGOUIN AT CAMBRIDGE THE YOUNG MEN SUPPED IN A SNUG ROOM LIT BY ELECTRIC CANDLE LAMPS
3607-135982-0030 THEY TALKED VOLUBLY AND WITH LITTLE RESERVE JIMMY WHOSE IMAGINATION WAS KINDLING CONCEIVED THE LIVELY YOUTH OF THE FRENCHMEN TWINED ELEGANTLY UPON THE FIRM FRAMEWORK OF THE ENGLISHMAN'S MANNER A GRACEFUL IMAGE OF HIS HE THOUGHT AND A JUST ONE
3607-135982-0032 RIVIERE NOT WHOLLY INGENUOUSLY UNDERTOOK TO EXPLAIN TO JIMMY THE TRIUMPH OF THE FRENCH MECHANICIANS THE RESONANT VOICE OF THE HUNGARIAN WAS ABOUT TO PREVAIL IN RIDICULE OF THE SPURIOUS LUTES OF THE ROMANTIC PAINTERS
3607-135982-0033 WHEN SEGOUIN SHEPHERDED HIS PARTY INTO POLITICS HERE WAS CONGENIAL GROUND FOR ALL JIMMY UNDER GENEROUS INFLUENCES FELT THE BURIED ZEAL OF HIS FATHER WAKE TO LIFE WITHIN HIM HE AROUSED THE TORPID ROUTH AT LAST
3607-135982-0035 THAT NIGHT THE CITY WORE THE MASK OF A CAPITAL THE FIVE YOUNG MEN STROLLED ALONG STEPHEN'S GREEN IN A FAINT CLOUD OF AROMATIC SMOKE THEY TALKED LOUDLY AND GAILY AND THEIR CLOAKS DANGLED FROM THEIR SHOULDERS THE PEOPLE MADE WAY FOR THEM
3607-135982-0036 AT THE CORNER OF GRAFTON STREET A SHORT FAT MAN WAS PUTTING TWO HANDSOME LADIES ON A CAR IN CHARGE OF ANOTHER FAT MAN THE CAR DROVE OFF AND THE SHORT FAT MAN CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE PARTY ANDRE IT'S FARLEY
3607-135982-0038 TO A MUSIC OF MERRY BELLS
3607-135982-0039 THEY WERE WALKING OUT OF KINGSTOWN STATION THE TICKET COLLECTOR SALUTED JIMMY HE WAS AN OLD MAN FINE NIGHT SIR IT WAS A SERENE SUMMER NIGHT THE HARBOUR LAY LIKE A DARKENED MIRROR AT THEIR FEET
3607-135982-0041 VILLONA SAID WITH CONVICTION IT IS DELIGHTFUL THERE WAS A YACHT PIANO IN THE CABIN VILLONA PLAYED A WALTZ FOR FARLEY AND RIVIERE FARLEY ACTING AS CAVALIER AND RIVIERE AS LADY
3607-135982-0042 THEN AN IMPROMPTU SQUARE DANCE THE MEN DEVISING ORIGINAL FIGURES WHAT MERRIMENT JIMMY TOOK HIS PART WITH A WILL THIS WAS SEEING LIFE AT LEAST THEN FARLEY GOT OUT OF BREATH AND CRIED STOP
3607-135982-0044 VILLONA SAYING HEAR HEAR WHENEVER THERE WAS A PAUSE THERE WAS A GREAT CLAPPING OF HANDS WHEN HE SAT DOWN IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GOOD SPEECH FARLEY CLAPPED HIM ON THE BACK AND LAUGHED LOUDLY WHAT JOVIAL FELLOWS WHAT GOOD COMPANY THEY WERE CARDS CARDS
3607-135982-0045 THE TABLE WAS CLEARED VILLONA RETURNED QUIETLY TO HIS PIANO AND PLAYED VOLUNTARIES FOR THEM THE OTHER MEN PLAYED GAME AFTER GAME FLINGING THEMSELVES BOLDLY INTO THE ADVENTURE THEY DRANK THE HEALTH OF THE QUEEN OF HEARTS AND OF THE QUEEN OF DIAMONDS
3607-135982-0047 THEY WERE DEVILS OF FELLOWS BUT HE WISHED THEY WOULD STOP IT WAS GETTING LATE SOMEONE GAVE THE TOAST OF THE YACHT THE BELLE OF NEWPORT AND THEN SOMEONE PROPOSED ONE GREAT GAME FOR A FINISH THE PIANO HAD STOPPED VILLONA MUST HAVE GONE UP ON DECK
3607-135982-0048 IT WAS A TERRIBLE GAME THEY STOPPED JUST BEFORE THE END OF IT TO DRINK FOR LUCK JIMMY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE GAME LAY BETWEEN ROUTH AND SEGOUIN WHAT EXCITEMENT JIMMY WAS EXCITED TOO HE WOULD LOSE OF COURSE HOW MUCH HAD HE WRITTEN AWAY
3607-135982-0050 HE KNEW THAT HE WOULD REGRET IN THE MORNING BUT AT PRESENT HE WAS GLAD OF THE REST GLAD OF THE DARK STUPOR THAT WOULD COVER UP HIS FOLLY HE LEANED HIS ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND RESTED HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS HANDS COUNTING THE BEATS OF HIS TEMPLES
3607-135982-0051 THE CABIN DOOR OPENED AND HE SAW THE HUNGARIAN STANDING IN A SHAFT OF GREY LIGHT
3664-11714-0001 WERE USELESS AND UNAVAILING AND SO HE HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE MUST PART FROM THOSE GENTLE TONGUED WOMEN OF HIS THOSE SWEET VOICED POETS HIS PALACES AND THEIR RICH HANGINGS THEREFORE HE HAD SUMMONED TO GIVE HIM ABSOLUTION FOR HIS SINS
3664-11714-0002 IN A MAN OF LESS HIGH PLACE THEY MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN CALLED CRIMES THE DOMINICAN GIRALAMO FRANCESCO SAVONAROLA IT WAS NOT HOWEVER WITHOUT AN INWARD FEAR AGAINST WHICH THE PRAISES OF HIS FRIENDS AVAILED NOTHING
3664-11714-0004 COMING LIKE THE STATUE OF THE COMMANDANTE TO KNOCK AT THE DOOR OF A DON GIOVANNI AND IN THE MIDST OF FEAST AND ORGY TO ANNOUNCE THAT IT IS EVEN NOW THE MOMENT TO BEGIN TO THINK OF HEAVEN HE HAD BEEN BORN AT FERRARA
3664-11714-0005 HAD FLED FROM HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HAD TAKEN THE VOWS IN THE CLOISTER OF DOMINICAN MONKS AT FLORENCE THERE WHERE HE WAS APPOINTED BY HIS SUPERIORS TO GIVE LESSONS IN PHILOSOPHY THE YOUNG NOVICE HAD FROM THE FIRST TO BATTLE AGAINST THE DEFECTS OF A VOICE THAT WAS BOTH HARSH AND WEAK
3664-11714-0007 AS IF THE SLAB OF HIS TOMB HAD ALREADY FALLEN OVER HIM THERE KNEELING ON THE FLAGS PRAYING UNCEASINGLY BEFORE A WOODEN CRUCIFIX FEVERED BY VIGILS AND PENANCES HE SOON PASSED OUT OF CONTEMPLATION INTO ECSTASY AND BEGAN TO FEEL IN HIMSELF
3664-11714-0008 THAT INWARD PROPHETIC IMPULSE WHICH SUMMONED HIM TO PREACH THE REFORMATION OF THE CHURCH NEVERTHELESS THE REFORMATION OF SAVONAROLA MORE REVERENTIAL THAN LUTHER'S WHICH FOLLOWED ABOUT FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS LATER RESPECTED THE THING WHILE ATTACKING THE MAN
3664-11714-0010 BUT A PROPHET YET ALTHOUGH HITHERTO HE HAD BOWED HIS HEAD BEFORE THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH HE HAD ALREADY RAISED IT AGAINST THE TEMPORAL POWER TO HIM RELIGION AND LIBERTY APPEARED AS TWO VIRGINS EQUALLY SACRED
3664-11714-0011 THE RESULT OF THIS WAS THAT SO LONG AS LORENZO LIVED IN RICHES HAPPINESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SAVONAROLA HAD NEVER BEEN WILLING WHATEVER ENTREATIES WERE MADE TO SANCTION BY HIS PRESENCE A POWER WHICH HE CONSIDERED ILLEGITIMATE
3664-11714-0013 LORENZO AS WE HAVE SAID WAS AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF SAVONAROLA WITH AN IMPATIENCE MIXED WITH UNEASINESS SO THAT WHEN HE HEARD THE SOUND OF HIS STEPS HIS PALE FACE TOOK A YET MORE DEATHLIKE TINGE
3664-11714-0014 APPEARED ON THE THRESHOLD WHEN HE PERCEIVED HIM LORENZO DEI MEDICI READING IN HIS MARBLE BROW THE INFLEXIBILITY OF A STATUE FELL BACK ON HIS BED BREATHING A SIGH SO PROFOUND THAT ONE MIGHT HAVE SUPPOSED IT WAS HIS LAST
3664-11714-0016 YOU BELIEVE THEN THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE MY SINS CRIED THE DYING MAN RENEWING HIS HOPE AS HE HEARD FROM THE LIPS OF THE MONK SUCH UNEXPECTED WORDS YOUR SINS AND ALSO YOUR CRIMES GOD WILL FORGIVE THEM ALL REPLIED SAVONAROLA
3664-11714-0017 GOD WILL FORGIVE YOUR VANITIES YOUR ADULTEROUS PLEASURES YOUR OBSCENE FESTIVALS SO MUCH FOR YOUR SINS
3664-11714-0019 HE REPLIED WITH A GROAN WHICH PROVED THE MONK'S MEMORY TO BE ONLY TOO TRUE THEN AT LAST WHEN HE HAD FINISHED LORENZO ASKED IN A DOUBTFUL TONE THEN DO YOU BELIEVE MY FATHER THAT GOD WILL FORGIVE ME EVERYTHING BOTH MY SINS AND MY CRIMES
3664-11714-0020 EVERYTHING SAID SAVONAROLA BUT ON THREE CONDITIONS WHAT ARE THEY ASKED THE DYING MAN THE FIRST SAID SAVONAROLA IS THAT YOU FEEL A COMPLETE FAITH IN THE POWER AND THE MERCY OF GOD
3664-11714-0022 MY FATHER SHALL I HAVE TIME ASKED THE DYING MAN GOD WILL GIVE IT TO YOU REPLIED THE MONK
3664-11714-0023 EXCLAIMED LORENZO FALLING BACK ON HIS BED AND SHAKING HIS HEAD NEVER THE MONK WITHOUT REPLYING A SINGLE WORD MADE A STEP TO WITHDRAW MY FATHER MY FATHER SAID THE DYING MAN DO NOT LEAVE ME THUS HAVE PITY ON ME HAVE PITY ON FLORENCE SAID THE MONK
3664-11714-0025 WILL COME YOUR SON PIERO POOR IN MONEY BECAUSE FROM THE FUNDS OF THE REPUBLIC YOU HAVE KEPT UP THE MAGNIFICENCE OF YOUR FAMILY AND THE CREDIT OF YOUR BUSINESS HOUSES POOR IN COURAGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE ROBBED THE RIGHTFUL MAGISTRATES OF THE AUTHORITY WHICH WAS CONSTITUTIONALLY THEIRS
3664-11714-0026 AND DIVERTED THE CITIZENS FROM THE DOUBLE PATH OF MILITARY AND CIVIL LIFE WHEREIN BEFORE THEY WERE ENERVATED BY YOUR LUXURIES THEY HAD DISPLAYED THE VIRTUES OF THE ANCIENTS AND THEREFORE WHEN THE DAY SHALL DAWN WHICH IS NOT FAR DISTANT CONTINUED THE MONK
3664-11714-0028 LET THEM RUIN YOUR SOUL AS THEY HAVE RUINED YOUR BODY AND AT THESE WORDS THE AUSTERE DOMINICAN WITHOUT LISTENING TO THE CRIES OF THE DYING MAN LEFT THE ROOM AS HE HAD ENTERED IT WITH FACE AND STEP UNALTERED FAR ABOVE HUMAN THINGS HE SEEMED TO SOAR
3664-11714-0029 A SPIRIT ALREADY DETACHED FROM THE EARTH AT THE CRY WHICH BROKE FROM LORENZO DEI MEDICI WHEN HE SAW HIM DISAPPEAR
3664-11714-0031 HIS LIPS CLINGING TO THE FEET OF THE CHRIST HE BREATHED HIS LAST IN THE ARMS OF THESE THREE MEN OF WHOM THE MOST FORTUNATE THOUGH ALL THREE WERE YOUNG WAS NOT DESTINED TO SURVIVE HIM MORE THAN TWO YEARS
3664-178355-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN CHAMPION BUFFALO KILLER SHORTLY AFTER THE ADVENTURES MENTIONED IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER I HAD MY CELEBRATED BUFFALO HUNT WITH BILLY COMSTOCK A NOTED SCOUT GUIDE AND INTERPRETER
3664-178355-0002 IT WAS ACCORDINGLY ARRANGED THAT I SHOULD SHOOT HIM A BUFFALO KILLING MATCH AND THE PRELIMINARIES WERE EASILY AND SATISFACTORILY AGREED UPON WE WERE TO HUNT ONE DAY OF EIGHT HOURS BEGINNING AT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND CLOSING AT FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3664-178355-0003 THE WAGER WAS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A SIDE AND THE MAN WHO SHOULD KILL THE GREATER NUMBER OF BUFFALOES FROM ON HORSEBACK WAS TO BE DECLARED THE WINNER THE HUNT TOOK PLACE ABOUT TWENTY MILES EAST OF SHERIDAN AND AS IT HAD BEEN PRETTY WELL ADVERTISED AND NOISED ABROAD
3664-178355-0005 THE BUFFALOES WERE QUITE PLENTY AND IT WAS AGREED THAT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SAME HERD AT THE SAME TIME AND MAKE A RUN AS WE CALLED IT EACH ONE KILLING AS MANY AS POSSIBLE A REFEREE WAS TO FOLLOW EACH OF US ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ENTERED THE HERD AND COUNT THE BUFFALOES KILLED BY EACH MAN
3664-178355-0006 WHEN THEY WERE TO COME UP AS NEAR AS THEY PLEASED AND WITNESS THE CHASE WE WERE FORTUNATE IN THE FIRST RUN IN GETTING GOOD GROUND COMSTOCK WAS MOUNTED ON ONE OF HIS FAVORITE HORSES WHILE I RODE OLD BRIGHAM I FELT CONFIDENT THAT I HAD THE ADVANTAGE OF COMSTOCK IN TWO THINGS
3664-178355-0008 WHILE COMSTOCK WAS ARMED WITH A HENRY RIFLE AND ALTHOUGH HE COULD FIRE A FEW SHOTS QUICKER THAN I COULD YET I WAS PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT DID NOT CARRY POWDER AND LEAD ENOUGH TO DO EXECUTION EQUAL TO MY CALIBRE FIFTY AT LAST THE TIME CAME TO BEGIN THE MATCH
3664-178355-0009 COMSTOCK AND I DASHED INTO A HERD FOLLOWED BY THE REFEREES THE BUFFALOES SEPARATED COMSTOCK TOOK THE LEFT BUNCH AND I THE RIGHT MY GREAT FORTE IN KILLING BUFFALOES FROM HORSEBACK WAS TO GET THEM CIRCLING BY RIDING MY HORSE AT THE HEAD OF THE HERD SHOOTING THE LEADERS
3664-178355-0011 I HAD NURSED MY BUFFALOES AS A BILLIARD PLAYER DOES THE BALLS WHEN HE MAKES A BIG RUN AFTER THE RESULT OF THE FIRST RUN HAD BEEN DULY ANNOUNCED OUR SAINT LOUIS EXCURSION FRIENDS WHO HAD APPROACHED TO THE PLACE WHERE WE HAD STOPPED SET OUT A LOT OF CHAMPAGNE WHICH THEY HAD BROUGHT WITH THEM
3664-178355-0012 AND WHICH PROVED A GOOD DRINK ON A KANSAS PRAIRIE AND A BUFFALO HUNTER WAS A GOOD MAN TO GET AWAY WITH IT WHILE TAKING A SHORT REST WE SUDDENLY SPIED ANOTHER HERD OF BUFFALOES COMING TOWARD US IT WAS ONLY A SMALL DROVE AND WE AT ONCE PREPARED TO GIVE THE ANIMALS A LIVELY RECEPTION
3664-178355-0014 WE CAME UP CLOSE TO ANOTHER HERD AS I WAS SO FAR AHEAD OF MY COMPETITOR IN THE NUMBER KILLED I THOUGHT I COULD AFFORD TO GIVE AN EXTRA EXHIBITION OF MY SKILL I HAD TOLD THE LADIES THAT I WOULD ON THE NEXT RUN RIDE MY HORSE WITHOUT SADDLE OR BRIDLE
3664-178355-0015 AND I REMEMBER ONE FAIR LADY WHO ENDEAVORED TO PREVAIL UPON ME NOT TO ATTEMPT IT THAT'S NOTHING AT ALL SAID I I HAVE DONE IT MANY A TIME AND OLD BRIGHAM KNOWS AS WELL AS I WHAT I AM DOING AND SOMETIMES A GREAT DEAL BETTER SO LEAVING MY SADDLE AND BRIDLE WITH THE WAGONS
3664-178355-0017 IT FRIGHTENED SOME OF THE TENDER CREATURES TO SEE THE BUFFALO COMING AT FULL SPEED DIRECTLY TOWARD THEM BUT WHEN HE HAD GOT WITHIN FIFTY YARDS OF ONE OF THE WAGONS I SHOT HIM DEAD IN HIS TRACKS THIS MADE MY SIXTY NINTH BUFFALO AND FINISHED MY THIRD AND LAST RUN
3664-178355-0018 COMSTOCK HAVING KILLED FORTY SIX AS IT WAS NOW LATE IN THE AFTERNOON COMSTOCK AND HIS BACKERS GAVE UP THE IDEA THAT HE COULD BEAT ME AND THEREUPON THE REFEREES DECLARED ME THE WINNER OF THE MATCH
3664-178355-0020 HAD ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION OF THE INDIANS WHO OVERTOOK HIM AND HIS COMPANION WHEN THEY HAD GONE ABOUT HALF A MILE AFTER SURROUNDING THE TWO MEN THEY SUDDENLY ATTACKED THEM THEY KILLED SCALPED AND ROBBED COMSTOCK BUT GROVER ALTHOUGH SEVERELY WOUNDED MADE HIS ESCAPE
3664-178355-0021 OWING TO THE FLEETNESS OF THE EXCELLENT HORSE WHICH HE WAS RIDING THIS SAD EVENT OCCURRED AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ON OUR WAY BACK TO CAMP WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE CHOICE MEAT AND FINEST HEADS
3664-178355-0023 AND SENT THEM TO ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES AND RAILROAD CENTERS IN THE COUNTRY HAVING THEM PLACED IN PROMINENT POSITIONS AT THE LEADING HOTELS DEPOTS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS AS A SORT OF TRADE MARK OR ADVERTISEMENT OF THE KANSAS PACIFIC RAILROAD
3664-178355-0024 AND TO DAY THEY ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF THE TRAVELER ALMOST EVERYWHERE WHENEVER I AM TRAVELING OVER THE COUNTRY AND SEE ONE OF THESE TRADE MARKS I FEEL PRETTY CERTAIN THAT I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE DEATH OF THE OLD FELLOW WHOSE BODY IT ONCE ORNAMENTED
3664-178355-0026 AS SCOUTS AND GUIDES WERE IN GREAT DEMAND I CONCLUDED ONCE MORE TO TAKE UP MY OLD AVOCATION OF SCOUTING AND GUIDING FOR THE ARMY HAVING NO SUITABLE PLACE IN WHICH TO LEAVE MY OLD AND FAITHFUL BUFFALO HUNTER BRIGHAM AND NOT WISHING TO KILL HIM BY SCOUTING
3664-178355-0027 I DETERMINED TO DISPOSE OF HIM I WAS VERY RELUCTANT TO PART WITH HIM BUT I CONSOLED MYSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO RECEIVE HARDER USAGE IN OTHER HANDS THAN HE HAD IN MINE I HAD SEVERAL GOOD OFFERS TO SELL HIM
3664-178355-0029 A PURSE OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS MADE UP TO BE GIVEN TO THE HORSE THAT COULD FIRST REACH WYANDOTTE FOUR MILES DISTANT THE ARRANGEMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AND BRIGHAM WAS ENTERED AS ONE OF THE CONTESTANTS FOR THE PURSE
3664-178355-0030 EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT MISTER BONHAM WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT HE WAS TO RIDE THAT POKY LOOKING PLUG AGAINST THE FIVE THOROUGHBREDS WHICH WERE TO TAKE PART IN THE RACE WHEN ALL THE PRELIMINARIES HAD BEEN ARRANGED THE SIGNAL WAS GIVEN AND OFF WENT THE HORSES FOR WYANDOTTE
3664-178355-0032 AND ARRIVED AT THE HOTEL THE HOME STATION IN WYANDOTTE A LONG WAY AHEAD OF HIS FASTEST COMPETITOR EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AS WELL AS DISGUSTED THAT SUCH A HOMELY CRITTER SHOULD BE THE WINNER BRIGHAM OF COURSE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED A WIDE REPUTATION
3664-178355-0033 AND HIS NAME AND EXPLOITS HAD OFTEN APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS AND WHEN IT WAS LEARNED THAT THIS CRITTER WAS NONE OTHER THAN THE IDENTICAL BUFFALO HUNTING BRIGHAM NEARLY THE WHOLE CROWD ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD HEARD OF HIM BEFORE AND HAD THEY KNOWN HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE THEY CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE RULED HIM OUT
3664-178355-0035 ONLY A FEW MILES OUT OF TOWN THE NEXT DAY I RODE OUT WITH MISTER WILCOX AND TOOK A LOOK AT THE GALLANT OLD HORSE HE WAS COMFORTABLY CARED FOR IN MISTER WILCOX'S STABLE AND LOOKED THE SAME CLEVER PONY THAT HE ALWAYS WAS IT SEEMED AS IF HE ALMOST REMEMBERED ME
3664-178355-0036 AND WHENEVER I AGAIN VISIT MEMPHIS I SHALL SURELY GO AND SEE BRIGHAM IF HE IS STILL ALIVE BUT TO RETURN TO THE THREAD OF MY NARRATIVE FROM WHICH I HAVE WANDERED
3664-178366-0001 AND I ACCEPTED HIS INVITATION TO RIDE OVER TO THE POST WITH HIM IN AN AMBULANCE ON THE WAY THITHER HE ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY HE SAID THAT GENERAL SHERIDAN AND HIMSELF HAD HAD SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT THE MATTER
3664-178366-0002 AND IF I WANTED A COMMISSION ONE COULD EASILY BE PROCURED FOR ME I THANKED GENERAL ORD FOR HIS KINDNESS AND SAID THAT ALTHOUGH AN OFFICER'S COMMISSION IN THE REGULAR ARMY WAS A TEMPTING PRIZE YET I PREFERRED TO REMAIN IN THE POSITION I WAS THEN HOLDING
3664-178366-0004 ON ARRIVING IN CHICAGO IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY COLONEL M V SHERIDAN WHO SAID THAT HIS BROTHER THE GENERAL HAD NOT YET RETURNED
3664-178366-0005 BUT HAD SENT WORD THAT I WAS TO BE HIS AND THE COLONEL'S GUEST AT THEIR HOUSE WHILE I REMAINED IN CHICAGO I SPENT TWO OR THREE DAYS VERY PLEASANTLY IN THE GREAT CITY OF THE WEST MEETING SEVERAL OF THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SHERIDAN HUNT IN SEPTEMBER GENERAL STAGER
3664-178366-0007 THAT IT WAS MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO FACE THE THRONG OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES
3664-178366-0008 I WAS TO STOP AT NIAGARA FALLS BUFFALO AND ROCHESTER ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK AND HE PROVIDED ME WITH ALL THE NECESSARY RAILROAD PASSES JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO LEAVE CHICAGO I MET PROFESSOR HENRY A WARD OF ROCHESTER FOR WHOM DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR OR TWO
3664-178366-0010 AND I HAD THE HONOR OF RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO DINE WITH THE MAYOR ON ARRIVING AT NEW YORK I WAS MET AT THE DEPOT BY MISTER J G HECKSHER WHO HAD BEEN APPOINTED AS A COMMITTEE OF ONE TO ESCORT ME TO THE UNION CLUB
3664-178366-0011 WHERE JAMES GORDON BENNETT LEONARD W JEROME AND OTHERS WERE TO GIVE ME AN INFORMAL RECEPTION AND WHERE I WAS TO MAKE MY HEADQUARTERS DURING MY VISIT IN THE GREAT METROPOLIS I HAD AN ELEGANT DINNER AT THE CLUB ROOMS WITH THE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD BEEN OUT ON THE SEPTEMBER HUNT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CLUB
3664-178366-0013 I FINALLY COMPROMISED THE MATTER BY AGREEING TO DIVIDE MY TIME BETWEEN THE UNION CLUB THE BREVOORT HOUSE AND NED BUNTLINE'S QUARTERS THE NEXT FEW DAYS I SPENT IN VIEWING THE SIGHTS OF NEW YORK EVERYTHING BEING NEW AND STARTLING
3664-178366-0014 CONVINCING ME THAT AS YET I HAD SEEN BUT A SMALL PORTION OF THE WORLD I RECEIVED NUMEROUS DINNER INVITATIONS AS WELL AS INVITATIONS TO VISIT DIFFERENT PLACES OF AMUSEMENT AND INTEREST BUT AS THEY CAME IN SO THICK AND FAST I SOON BECAME BADLY DEMORALIZED AND CONFUSED
3664-178366-0016 BUT OWING TO MY CONFUSION ARISING FROM THE MANY OTHER INVITATIONS I HAD RECEIVED I FORGOT ALL ABOUT IT AND DINED ELSEWHERE THIS WAS A BAD BREAK BUT I DID NOT LEARN OF MY MISTAKE UNTIL NEXT DAY WHEN AT THE UNION CLUB HOUSE SEVERAL GENTLEMEN AMONG THEM LAWRENCE JEROME
3664-178366-0017 AND WHY I HAD NOT PUT IN AN APPEARANCE AT BENNETT'S DINNER THEY SAID THAT BENNETT HAD TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO GIVE ME A SPLENDID RECEPTION THAT THE PARTY HAD WAITED TILL NINE O'CLOCK FOR ME AND THAT MY NON ARRIVAL CAUSED CONSIDERABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
3664-178366-0019 NEVER MIND GENTLEMEN I'LL GIVE CODY A DINNER AT MY HOUSE THANK YOU SIR SAID I I SEE YOU ARE DETERMINED THAT I SHALL NOT RUN SHORT OF RATIONS WHILE I AM IN THE CITY I'LL BE THERE SURE
3664-178366-0020 BOTH MISTER JEROME AND MISTER HECKSHER TOLD ME THAT I MUST NOT DISAPPOINT MISTER BELMONT FOR HIS DINNERS WERE SPLENDID AFFAIRS I MADE A NOTE OF THE DATE AND AT THE APPOINTED TIME I WAS PROMPTLY AT MISTER BELMONT'S MANSION WHERE I SPENT A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING
3664-178366-0022 THE DANCERS KEPT ON THEIR MASKS UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND THE MERRY AND MOTLEY THRONG PRESENTED A BRILLIANT SCENE MOVING GRACEFULLY BENEATH THE BRIGHT GAS LIGHT TO THE INSPIRITING MUSIC TO ME IT WAS A NOVEL AND ENTERTAINING SIGHT
3664-178366-0023 AND EXHIBITED SOME OF MY BACKWOODS STEPS WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT AS GRACEFUL AS SOME WERE A GREAT DEAL MORE EMPHATIC BUT WHEN I UNDERTOOK TO DO ARTISTIC DANCING I FOUND I WAS DECIDEDLY OUT OF PLACE IN THAT CROWD AND I ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW FROM THE FLOOR
3664-178366-0025 NED BUNTLINE AND FRED MAEDER HAD DRAMATIZED ONE OF THE STORIES WHICH THE FORMER HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ME FOR THE NEW YORK WEEKLY THE DRAMA WAS CALLED BUFFALO BILL THE KING OF BORDER MEN WHILE I WAS IN NEW YORK IT WAS PRODUCED AT THE BOWERY THEATER
3664-178366-0026 AND OF COURSE I WAS PRESENT ON THE OPENING NIGHT A PRIVATE BOX HAVING BEEN RESERVED FOR ME THE THEATER WAS PACKED EVERY SEAT BEING OCCUPIED AS WELL AS THE STANDING ROOM THE DRAMA WAS PLAYED SMOOTHLY AND CREATED A GREAT DEAL OF ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0028 AND THAT I SHOULD BE INTRODUCED TO MISTER STUDLEY I FINALLY CONSENTED AND THE NEXT MOMENT I FOUND MYSELF STANDING BEHIND THE FOOTLIGHTS AND IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I LOOKED UP THEN DOWN THEN ON EACH SIDE AND EVERYWHERE I SAW A SEA OF HUMAN FACES
3664-178366-0029 BUT WHAT THEY WERE I COULD NOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME TELL NOR COULD ANY ONE ELSE IN THE HOUSE MY UTTERANCES WERE INAUDIBLE EVEN TO THE LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA MISTER DEAN WHO WAS SITTING ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF ME BOWING TO THE AUDIENCE I BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO ONE OF THE CANONS OF THE STAGE
3664-178366-0031 AND THAT HE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO MAKE AN ACTOR OUT OF A GOVERNMENT MULE I THANKED HIM FOR THE GENEROUS OFFER WHICH I HAD TO DECLINE OWING TO A LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MYSELF OR AS SOME PEOPLE MIGHT EXPRESS IT I DIDN'T HAVE THE REQUISITE CHEEK TO UNDERTAKE A THING OF THAT SORT
3664-178366-0032 THE PLAY OF BUFFALO BILL HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL RUN OF SIX OR EIGHT WEEKS AND WAS AFTERWARDS PRODUCED IN ALL THE PRINCIPAL CITIES OF THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE BEING RECEIVED WITH GENUINE ENTHUSIASM
3664-178366-0034 THIS HE WILLINGLY DID AND THEN INFORMED ME THAT MY SERVICES WOULD SOON BE REQUIRED AT FORT MC PHERSON AS THERE WAS TO BE AN EXPEDITION SENT OUT FROM THAT POINT AT WESTCHESTER PENNSYLVANIA I HAD SOME RELATIVES LIVING WHOM I HAD NEVER SEEN
3664-178366-0035 AND NOW BEING SO NEAR I DETERMINED TO MAKE THEM A VISIT UPON MENTIONING THE MATTER TO BUNTLINE HE SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD TOGETHER TAKE A TRIP TO PHILADELPHIA AND THENCE RUN OUT TO WESTCHESTER
3664-178366-0037 THEY WERE ALL VERY ANXIOUS TO HAVE US REMAIN SEVERAL DAYS BUT AS I HAD SOME BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO IN NEW YORK I WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN THAT DAY ASSURING THEM HOWEVER THAT I WOULD VISIT THEM AGAIN SOON I BADE THEM ADIEU AND WITH BUNTLINE TOOK THE TRAIN FOR NEW YORK

3699-19401-0023 THERE IS NOTHING FURTHER FOR THEE WHICH OCCURS TO ME AT PRESENT UNLESS THE BREAKING OUT OF A FRESH WAR SO WISHING EVERY THING DEAR TOBY FOR BEST I REST THY AFFECTIONATE BROTHER WALTER SHANDY
3699-19401-0024 WHILST MY FATHER WAS WRITING HIS LETTER OF INSTRUCTIONS MY UNCLE TOBY AND THE CORPORAL WERE BUSY IN PREPARING EVERY THING FOR THE ATTACK AS THE TURNING OF THE THIN SCARLET BREECHES WAS LAID ASIDE AT LEAST FOR THE PRESENT
3699-19401-0026 BUT THE ACCOUNT OF THIS IS WORTH MORE THAN TO BE WOVE INTO THE FAG END OF THE EIGHTH ALLUDING TO THE FIRST EDITION VOLUME OF SUCH A WORK AS THIS
3699-19402-0000 COULD HAVE VENTED SUCH AN INSINUATION HE WAS HOWEVER FRANK AND GENEROUS IN HIS NATURE AND AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO CONVICTION SO THAT HE HAD SCARCE GOT TO THE LAST WORD OF THIS UNGRACIOUS RETORT
3699-19402-0002 SHE RAISED HER FINGERS AND LET THEM FALL IT COULD SCARCE BE CALL'D A TAP OR IF IT WAS A TAP
3699-19402-0003 WHETHER TWAS A TAP OF REMONSTRANCE OR A TAP OF CONFESSION MY FATHER WHO WAS ALL SENSIBILITIES FROM HEAD TO FOOT
3699-19402-0005 A THIN BLUE CHILL PELLUCID CHRYSTAL WITH ALL ITS HUMOURS SO AT REST THE LEAST MOTE OR SPECK OF DESIRE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SEEN AT THE BOTTOM OF IT HAD IT EXISTED
3699-19402-0006 MY MOTHER MADAM WAS SO AT NO TIME EITHER BY NATURE BY INSTITUTION OR EXAMPLE A TEMPERATE CURRENT OF BLOOD RAN ORDERLY THROUGH HER VEINS IN ALL MONTHS OF THE YEAR
3699-19402-0008 THAT TWAS THE WHOLE BUSINESS OF HIS LIFE TO KEEP ALL FANCIES OF THAT KIND OUT OF HER HEAD NATURE HAD DONE HER PART TO HAVE SPARED HIM THIS TROUBLE AND WHAT WAS NOT A LITTLE INCONSISTENT MY FATHER KNEW IT
3699-19402-0009 AND HERE AM I SITTING THIS TWELFTH DAY OF AUGUST SEVENTEEN SIXTY SIX IN A PURPLE JERKIN AND YELLOW PAIR OF SLIPPERS WITHOUT EITHER WIG OR CAP ON A MOST TRAGICOMICAL COMPLETION OF HIS PREDICTION
3699-19402-0011 IT BECAME A VIOLATION OF NATURE AND WAS SO FAR YOU SEE CRIMINAL IT IS FOR THIS REASON AN PLEASE YOUR REVERENCES THAT KEY HOLES ARE THE OCCASIONS OF MORE SIN AND WICKEDNESS THAN ALL OTHER HOLES
3699-19402-0012 THOUGH THE CORPORAL HAD BEEN AS GOOD AS HIS WORD IN PUTTING MY UNCLE TOBY'S GREAT RAMALLIE WIG INTO PIPES YET THE TIME WAS TOO SHORT TO PRODUCE ANY GREAT EFFECTS FROM IT IT HAD LAIN MANY YEARS SQUEEZED UP IN THE CORNER OF HIS OLD CAMPAIGN TRUNK
3699-19402-0014 SUCH IT WAS OR RATHER SUCH WOULD IT HAVE SEEM'D UPON ANY OTHER BROW BUT THE SWEET LOOK OF GOODNESS WHICH SAT UPON MY UNCLE TOBY'S ASSIMILATED EVERY THING AROUND IT SO SOVEREIGNLY TO ITSELF
3699-19402-0015 AND NATURE HAD MOREOVER WROTE GENTLEMAN WITH SO FAIR A HAND IN EVERY LINE OF HIS COUNTENANCE THAT EVEN HIS TARNISH'D GOLD LACED HAT AND HUGE COCKADE OF FLIMSY TAFFETA BECAME HIM
3699-19402-0017 AND TO SHORTEN ALL DESCRIPTION THEY SHONE SO BRIGHT AGAINST THE SUN THAT MORNING AND HAD SO METALLICK AND DOUGHTY AN AIR WITH THEM THAT HAD MY UNCLE TOBY THOUGHT OF ATTACKING IN ARMOUR NOTHING COULD HAVE SO WELL IMPOSED UPON HIS IMAGINATION
3699-19402-0018 AND WITH HIS HAIR TUCK'D UP UNDER HIS MONTERO CAP WHICH HE HAD FURBISH'D UP FOR THE OCCASION
3699-19402-0020 LIKE A PIKE IT LOOKS WELL AT LEAST QUOTH MY FATHER TO HIMSELF
3699-19402-0021 MY UNCLE TOBY TURN'D HIS HEAD MORE THAN ONCE BEHIND HIM TO SEE HOW HE WAS SUPPORTED BY THE CORPORAL AND THE CORPORAL AS OFT AS HE DID IT GAVE A SLIGHT FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK
3699-19402-0023 INFINITE WAS HIS PITY NOR WOULD THE MOST COURTEOUS KNIGHT OF ROMANCE HAVE GONE FURTHER AT LEAST UPON ONE LEG TO HAVE WIPED AWAY A TEAR FROM A WOMAN'S EYE
3699-19402-0024 AND YET EXCEPTING ONCE THAT HE WAS BEGUILED INTO IT BY MISSUS WADMAN HE HAD NEVER LOOKED STEDFASTLY INTO ONE AND WOULD OFTEN TELL MY FATHER IN THE SIMPLICITY OF HIS HEART
3699-19402-0026 YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL KNOWS OF TOM'S MISFORTUNES BUT THIS AFFAIR HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM ANY FURTHER THAN THIS
3699-19402-0027 THAT IF TOM HAD NOT MARRIED THE WIDOW OR HAD IT PLEASED GOD AFTER THEIR MARRIAGE THAT THEY HAD BUT PUT PORK INTO THEIR SAUSAGES THE HONEST SOUL HAD NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT OF HIS WARM BED AND DRAGG'D TO THE INQUISITION
3699-19402-0029 SAID MY UNCLE TOBY MUSING WHILST A MAN IS FREE CRIED THE CORPORAL GIVING A FLOURISH WITH HIS STICK THUS
3699-19402-0030 A THOUSAND OF MY FATHER'S MOST SUBTLE SYLLOGISMS COULD NOT HAVE SAID MORE FOR CELIBACY MY UNCLE TOBY LOOK'D EARNESTLY TOWARDS HIS COTTAGE AND HIS BOWLING GREEN
3699-47246-0001 NICE DISTINCTIONS ARE TROUBLESOME IT IS SO MUCH EASIER TO SAY THAT A THING IS BLACK THAN TO DISCRIMINATE THE PARTICULAR SHADE OF BROWN BLUE OR GREEN TO WHICH IT REALLY BELONGS
3699-47246-0002 BESIDES THINK OF ALL THE VIRTUOUS DECLAMATION ALL THE PENETRATING OBSERVATION WHICH HAD BEEN BUILT UP ENTIRELY ON THE FUNDAMENTAL POSITION THAT THE COUNTESS WAS A VERY OBJECTIONABLE PERSON INDEED
3699-47246-0004 HAD NO COMPENSATING SUPERIORITY IN VIRTUE TO SET AGAINST THE OTHER LADY'S MANIFEST SUPERIORITY IN PERSONAL CHARMS MISS PHIPPS'S STUMPY FIGURE AND UNSUCCESSFUL ATTIRE
3699-47246-0005 INSTEAD OF LOOKING DOWN FROM A MOUNT OF VIRTUE WITH AN AUREOLE ROUND ITS HEAD WOULD THEN BE SEEN ON THE SAME LEVEL AND IN THE SAME LIGHT AS THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI'S DIANA LIKE FORM AND WELL CHOSEN DRAPERY
3699-47246-0007 THEN WHAT AMUSING INNUENDOES OF THE MILBY GENTLEMEN OVER THEIR WINE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED AND REDUCED TO NOUGHT IF YOU HAD TOLD THEM THAT THE COUNTESS HAD REALLY BEEN GUILTY OF NO MISDEMEANOURS WHICH DEMANDED HER EXCLUSION FROM STRICTLY RESPECTABLE SOCIETY
3699-47246-0008 HAD SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN DANCING LESSONS IN THE METROPOLIS THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN HER HALF BROTHER WHO BY UNIMPEACHED INTEGRITY AND INDUSTRY
3699-47246-0010 MISTER BRIDMAIN IN FACT QUADRAGENARIAN BACHELOR AS HE WAS FELT EXTREMELY WELL PLEASED TO RECEIVE HIS SISTER IN HER WIDOWHOOD AND TO SHINE IN THE REFLECTED LIGHT OF HER BEAUTY AND TITLE
3699-47246-0011 EVERY MAN WHO IS NOT A MONSTER A MATHEMATICIAN OR A MAD PHILOSOPHER IS THE SLAVE OF SOME WOMAN OR OTHER MISTER BRIDMAIN HAD PUT HIS NECK UNDER THE YOKE OF HIS HANDSOME SISTER AND THOUGH HIS SOUL WAS A VERY LITTLE ONE
3699-47246-0013 AND THERE WAS ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT MISTER BRIDMAIN'S FIRST NUPTIALS MIGHT OCCUR BEFORE THE COUNTESS WAS QUITE SURE OF HER SECOND AS IT WAS HOWEVER HE SUBMITTED TO ALL HIS SISTER'S CAPRICES
3699-47246-0014 AS PERSONAGES ON THE DEBATABLE GROUND BETWEEN ARISTOCRACY AND COMMONALTY INSTEAD OF SETTLING IN SOME SPOT WHERE HIS FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR MIGHT HAVE WON HIM THE DEFINITE DIGNITY OF A PAROCHIAL MAGNATE
3699-47246-0016 NOT INDEED ANY VERY RIPE AND COMPREHENSIVE WISDOM BUT MUCH EXTERNAL POLISH AND CERTAIN PRACTICAL CONCLUSIONS OF A VERY DECIDED KIND
3699-47246-0017 ONE OF THESE CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT THERE WERE THINGS MORE SOLID IN LIFE THAN FINE WHISKERS AND A TITLE AND THAT IN ACCEPTING A SECOND HUSBAND
3699-47246-0019 SO SHE HAD DETERMINED ON TRYING A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE WERE EXTREMELY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S AFFAIRS AND WHERE THE WOMEN WERE MOSTLY ILL DRESSED AND UGLY
3699-47246-0020 AND GIVE HIM AT LEAST A SORT OF COUSINSHIP TO THE QUARTER SESSIONS ALL THIS WHICH WAS THE SIMPLE TRUTH WOULD HAVE SEEMED EXTREMELY FLAT TO THE GOSSIPS OF MILBY WHO HAD MADE UP THEIR MINDS TO SOMETHING MUCH MORE EXCITING
3699-47246-0022 WHO CONSIDERS SUCH SLIGHT BLEMISHES SUCH MORAL PIMPLES AS THESE DISQUALIFICATIONS FOR ENTERING INTO THE MOST RESPECTABLE SOCIETY INDEED
3699-47246-0023 THE SEVEREST LADIES IN MILBY WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECTLY AWARE THAT THESE CHARACTERISTICS WOULD HAVE CREATED NO WIDE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE COUNTESS CZERLASKI AND THEMSELVES AND SINCE IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A WIDE DISTINCTION
3699-47246-0025 IN SPITE OF HER ASSIDUOUS CHURCH GOING AND THE DEEP DISGUST SHE WAS KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED AT THE EXTREME PAUCITY OF THE CONGREGATIONS ON ASH WEDNESDAYS
3699-47246-0026 SO SHE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT SHE HAD MISCALCULATED THE ADVANTAGES OF A NEIGHBOURHOOD WHERE PEOPLE ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH EACH OTHER'S PRIVATE AFFAIRS
3699-47246-0028 AND HAD AN UNEASY SENSE THAT SHE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER SAFE IN THAT QUARTER SHE HAD SERIOUS INTENTIONS OF BECOMING QUITE PIOUS WITHOUT ANY RESERVES WHEN SHE HAD ONCE GOT HER CARRIAGE AND SETTLEMENT
3699-47246-0029 THE COUNTESS DID NOT QUOTE SOPHOCLES BUT SHE SAID TO HERSELF ONLY THIS LITTLE BIT OF PRETENCE AND VANITY AND THEN I WILL BE QUITE GOOD AND MAKE MYSELF QUITE SAFE FOR ANOTHER WORLD
3699-47246-0031 THUS THERE WAS REALLY NOT MUCH AFFECTATION IN HER SWEET SPEECHES AND ATTENTIONS TO MISTER AND MISSUS BARTON
3699-47246-0032 STILL THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY NO MEANS ADEQUATELY REPRESENTED THE OBJECT SHE HAD IN VIEW WHEN SHE CAME TO MILBY AND IT HAD BEEN FOR SOME TIME CLEAR TO HER THAT SHE MUST SUGGEST A NEW CHANGE OF RESIDENCE TO HER BROTHER
3699-175950-0001 NOW MY GREAT GRANDFATHER'S NOSE WAS FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE UNTO THE NOSES OF ALL THE MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHOM PANTAGRUEL FOUND DWELLING UPON THE ISLAND OF ENNASIN
3699-175950-0002 BY THE WAY IF YOU WOULD KNOW THE STRANGE WAY OF GETTING A KIN AMONGST SO FLAT NOSED A PEOPLE YOU MUST READ THE BOOK FIND IT OUT YOURSELF YOU NEVER CAN
3699-175950-0004 SO THAT MY FATHER HAD THE JOINTURE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS HALF YEARLY ON MICHAELMAS AND LADY DAY DURING ALL THAT TIME NO MAN DISCHARGED PECUNIARY OBLIGATIONS WITH A BETTER GRACE THAN MY FATHER
3699-175950-0005 AS SOON AS EVER HE ENTER'D UPON THE ODD FIFTY HE GENERALLY GAVE A LOUD HEM
3699-175950-0007 AND FEEL PITY FOR THE FORCE OF EDUCATION AND THE PREVALENCE OF OPINIONS LONG DERIVED FROM ANCESTORS FOR THREE GENERATIONS AT LEAST THIS TENET IN FAVOUR OF LONG NOSES
3699-175950-0008 SO THAT THE WHIMSICALITY OF MY FATHER'S BRAIN WAS FAR FROM HAVING THE WHOLE HONOUR OF THIS AS IT HAD OF ALMOST ALL HIS OTHER STRANGE NOTIONS FOR IN A GREAT MEASURE HE MIGHT BE SAID TO HAVE SUCK'D THIS IN WITH HIS MOTHER'S MILK
3699-175950-0010 THAT IT MUST BE ONE OF THE GREATEST PROBLEMS IN CIVIL LIFE WHERE THE SAME NUMBER OF LONG AND JOLLY NOSES FOLLOWING ONE ANOTHER IN A DIRECT LINE
3699-175950-0011 I MEAN THE EXTERNAL ORGAN OF SMELLING OR THAT PART OF MAN WHICH STANDS PROMINENT IN HIS FACE AND WHICH PAINTERS SAY IN GOOD JOLLY NOSES AND WELL PROPORTIONED FACES SHOULD COMPREHEND A FULL THIRD THAT IS MEASURED DOWNWARDS FROM THE SETTING ON OF THE HAIR
3699-175950-0013 AS A MAN IN A STATE OF NATURE PICKS UP AN APPLE IT BECOMES HIS OWN AND IF HE IS A MAN OF SPIRIT HE WOULD LOSE HIS LIFE RATHER THAN GIVE IT UP
3699-175950-0014 THE APPLE IS AS MUCH FRANK'S APPLE AS JOHN'S PRAY MISTER SHANDY WHAT PATENT HAS HE TO SHEW FOR IT AND HOW DID IT BEGIN TO BE HIS WAS IT WHEN HE SET HIS HEART UPON IT OR WHEN HE GATHERED IT
3699-175950-0016 BROTHER DIDIUS TRIBONIUS WILL ANSWER NOW TRIBONIUS THE CIVILIAN AND CHURCH LAWYER'S BEARD BEING THREE INCHES AND A HALF AND THREE EIGHTHS LONGER THAN DIDIUS HIS BEARD
3699-175950-0017 THAT THE SWEAT OF A MAN'S BROWS AND THE EXSUDATIONS OF A MAN'S BRAINS ARE AS MUCH A MAN'S OWN PROPERTY AS THE BREECHES UPON HIS BACKSIDE
3699-175950-0019 WOULD FLY TO WHATEVER HE COULD LAY HIS HANDS ON AND IN A WORD WOULD INTRENCH AND FORTIFY THEM ROUND WITH AS MANY CIRCUMVALLATIONS AND BREAST WORKS AS MY UNCLE TOBY WOULD A CITADEL
3699-175950-0020 BY THE TROTTING OF MY LEAN HORSE THE THING IS INCREDIBLE AND I AM QUITE LOST IN MY UNDERSTANDING WHEN I AM CONSIDERING WHAT A TREASURE OF PRECIOUS TIME AND TALENTS TOGETHER HAS BEEN WASTED UPON WORSE SUBJECTS
3699-175950-0022 BUT THAT WAS NOT THY TRANSGRESSION MY DEAR UNCLE HERE BUT WHY HERE RATHER THAN IN ANY OTHER PART OF MY STORY I AM NOT ABLE TO TELL BUT HERE IT IS MY HEART STOPS ME
3699-175950-0023 WHILST I AM POURING FORTH THE WARMEST SENTIMENT OF LOVE FOR THEE AND VENERATION FOR THE EXCELLENCY OF THY CHARACTER THAT EVER VIRTUE AND NATURE KINDLED IN A NEPHEW'S BOSOM
3699-175950-0025 FOR EACH MAN'S NEED THOU HADST A SHILLING WHILST I AM WORTH ONE TO PAY A WEEDER THY PATH FROM THY DOOR TO THY BOWLING GREEN SHALL NEVER BE GROWN UP
3723-171115-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE DEATH OF JOSEPH HEROD'S BROTHER WHICH HAD BEEN SIGNIFIED TO HEROD IN DREAMS HOW HEROD WAS PRESERVED TWICE AFTER A WONDERFUL MANNER HE CUTS OFF THE HEAD OF PAPPUS
3723-171115-0002 ONE IN THE MEAN TIME HEROD'S AFFAIRS IN JUDEA WERE IN AN ILL STATE HE HAD LEFT HIS BROTHER JOSEPH WITH FULL POWER BUT HAD CHARGED HIM TO MAKE NO ATTEMPTS AGAINST ANTIGONUS TILL HIS RETURN
3723-171115-0003 FOR THAT MACHAERUS WOULD NOT BE SUCH AN ASSISTANT AS HE COULD DEPEND ON AS IT APPEARED BY WHAT HE HAD DONE ALREADY
3723-171115-0005 FOR THESE COHORTS WERE NEW RAISED MEN GATHERED OUT OF SYRIA AND HERE WAS NO MIXTURE OF THOSE CALLED VETERAN SOLDIERS AMONG THEM WHO MIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THOSE THAT WERE UNSKILLFUL IN WAR TWO
3723-171115-0006 AND THERE DROWNED THEM THERE WAS A GREAT CHANGE MADE ALSO IN IDUMEA WHERE MACHAERUS WAS BUILDING A WALL ABOUT ONE OF THE FORTRESSES WHICH WAS CALLED GITTHA BUT HEROD HAD NOT YET BEEN INFORMED OF THESE THINGS
3723-171115-0008 AND AS HE LEAPED OUT OF HIS BED IN A DISTURBED MANNER THERE CAME MESSENGERS THAT ACQUAINTED HIM WITH THAT CALAMITY SO WHEN HE HAD LAMENTED THIS MISFORTUNE FOR A WHILE HE PUT OFF THE MAIN PART OF HIS MOURNING AND MADE HASTE TO MARCH AGAINST HIS ENEMIES
3723-171115-0009 HE MADE AN IRRUPTION INTO GALILEE AND MET HIS ENEMIES AND DROVE THEM BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH THEY HAD LEFT
3723-171115-0011 HE HAD THE REPUTATION OF BEING VERY DEAR TO GOD FOR THAT EVENING THERE FEASTED WITH HIM MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL MEN AND AFTER THAT FEAST WAS OVER AND ALL THE GUESTS WERE GONE OUT THE HOUSE FELL DOWN IMMEDIATELY
3723-171115-0012 AND BEGAN TO FIGHT WITH THOSE IN HIS FOREFRONT YET DURST THEY NOT BE SO VERY BOLD AS TO ENGAGE THE ROMANS HAND TO HAND BUT THREW STONES AND DARTS AT THEM AT A DISTANCE BY WHICH MEANS THEY WOUNDED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER
3723-171115-0014 BUT HEROD OVERRAN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY AND DEMOLISHED FIVE LITTLE CITIES AND DESTROYED TWO THOUSAND MEN THAT WERE IN THEM AND BURNED THEIR HOUSES AND THEN RETURNED TO HIS CAMP BUT HIS HEAD QUARTERS WERE AT THE VILLAGE CALLED CANA SIX
3723-171115-0015 NOW A GREAT MULTITUDE OF JEWS RESORTED TO HIM EVERY DAY BOTH OUT OF JERICHO AND THE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SOME WERE MOVED SO TO DO OUT OF THEIR HATRED TO ANTIGONUS AND SOME OUT OF REGARD TO THE GLORIOUS ACTIONS HEROD HAD DONE
3723-171115-0017 AND IT CAME TO A CLOSE FIGHT NOW OTHER PARTS OF THEIR ARMY MADE RESISTANCE FOR A WHILE BUT HEROD RUNNING THE UTMOST HAZARD OUT OF THE RAGE HE WAS IN AT THE MURDER OF HIS BROTHER THAT HE MIGHT BE AVENGED ON THOSE THAT HAD BEEN THE AUTHORS OF IT
3723-171115-0018 SOON BEAT THOSE THAT OPPOSED HIM AND AFTER HE HAD BEATEN THEM HE ALWAYS TURNED HIS FORCE AGAINST THOSE THAT STOOD TO IT STILL AND PURSUED THEM ALL SO THAT A GREAT SLAUGHTER WAS MADE WHILE SOME WERE FORCED BACK INTO THAT VILLAGE WHENCE THEY CAME OUT
3723-171115-0020 AND WHEN HE HAD BEATEN THOSE THAT WERE ON THE OUTSIDE HE PULLED THE HOUSES TO PIECES AND PLUCKED OUT THOSE THAT WERE WITHIN UPON MANY HE HAD THE ROOFS SHAKEN DOWN WHEREBY THEY PERISHED BY HEAPS AND AS FOR THOSE THAT FLED OUT OF THE RUINS
3723-171115-0021 THAT THE CONQUERORS COULD NOT PASS ALONG THE ROADS NOW THE ENEMY COULD NOT BEAR THIS BLOW SO THAT WHEN THE MULTITUDE OF THEM WHICH WAS GATHERED TOGETHER SAW THAT THOSE IN THE VILLAGE WERE SLAIN THEY DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND FLED AWAY
3723-171115-0023 NOW WHEN AT THE EVENING HEROD HAD ALREADY DISMISSED HIS FRIENDS TO REFRESH THEMSELVES AFTER THEIR FATIGUE AND WHEN HE WAS GONE HIMSELF WHILE HE WAS STILL HOT IN HIS ARMOR LIKE A COMMON SOLDIER TO BATHE HIMSELF
3723-171115-0024 ONE OF THE ENEMIES MET HIM IN THE FACE WITH A SWORD IN HIS HAND AND THEN A SECOND AND THEN A THIRD AND AFTER THAT MORE OF THEM THESE WERE MEN WHO HAD RUN AWAY OUT OF THE BATTLE INTO THE BATH IN THEIR ARMOR
3723-171115-0026 NOW THERE WAS BY CHANCE NOBODY ELSE AT HAND THAT MIGHT SEIZE UPON THESE MEN AND FOR HEROD HE WAS CONTENTED TO HAVE COME TO NO HARM HIMSELF SO THAT THEY ALL GOT AWAY IN SAFETY EIGHT
3723-171115-0027 BUT ON THE NEXT DAY HEROD HAD PAPPUS'S HEAD CUT OFF WHO WAS THE GENERAL FOR ANTIGONUS AND WAS SLAIN IN THE BATTLE AND SENT IT TO HIS BROTHER PHERORAS BY WAY OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SLAIN BROTHER FOR HE WAS THE MAN THAT SLEW JOSEPH
3723-171115-0029 ACQUAINTANCE AT THE WORKS BUT HE WENT HIMSELF TO SAMARIA TO TAKE THE DAUGHTER OF ALEXANDER THE SON OF ARISTOBULUS TO WIFE WHO HAD BEEN BETROTHED TO HIM BEFORE AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID
3723-171115-0030 AND THUS HE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY THE BY DURING THE SIEGE OF THE CITY FOR HE HAD HIS ENEMIES IN GREAT CONTEMPT ALREADY NINE WHEN HE HAD THUS MARRIED MARIAMNE HE
3723-171115-0032 WHICH WERE ELEVEN REGIMENTS OF FOOTMEN AND SIX THOUSAND HORSEMEN BESIDES THE SYRIAN AUXILIARIES WHICH WERE NO SMALL PART OF THE ARMY THEY PITCHED THEIR CAMP NEAR TO THE NORTH WALL HEROD'S DEPENDENCE WAS UPON THE DECREE OF THE SENATE
3723-171115-0033 BY WHICH HE WAS MADE KING AND SOSIUS RELIED UPON ANTONY WHO SENT THE ARMY THAT WAS UNDER HIM TO HEROD'S ASSISTANCE CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW HEROD AND SOSIUS TOOK JERUSALEM BY FORCE
3723-171115-0035 AND THESE PARTICULARLY PLUNDERED THE PLACES THAT WERE ABOUT THE CITY AND THIS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FOOD LEFT EITHER FOR THE HORSES OR THE MEN YET SOME OF THE WARLIKE MEN WHO WERE USED TO FIGHT REGULARLY WERE APPOINTED TO DEFEND THE CITY DURING THE SIEGE
3723-171115-0036 NOW AS FOR THE ROBBERIES WHICH WERE COMMITTED THE KING CONTRIVED THAT AMBUSHES SHOULD BE SO LAID THAT THEY MIGHT RESTRAIN THEIR EXCURSIONS AND AS FOR THE WANT OF PROVISIONS HE PROVIDED THAT THEY SHOULD BE BROUGHT TO THEM FROM GREAT DISTANCES
3723-171115-0038 BUT THROUGH THEIR MINES UNDER GROUND THEY WOULD APPEAR IN THE MIDST OF THEM ON THE SUDDEN AND BEFORE THEY COULD BATTER DOWN ONE WALL THEY BUILT THEM ANOTHER IN ITS STEAD AND TO SUM UP ALL AT ONCE
3723-171115-0039 THEY BORE A SIEGE OF FIVE MONTHS TILL SOME OF HEROD'S CHOSEN MEN VENTURED TO GET UPON THE WALL AND FELL INTO THE CITY AS DID SOSIUS'S CENTURIONS AFTER THEM
3723-171115-0041 AND BY REASON THAT THE JEWS WHO WERE ABOUT HEROD EARNESTLY ENDEAVORED THAT NONE OF THEIR ADVERSARIES MIGHT REMAIN SO THEY WERE CUT TO PIECES BY GREAT MULTITUDES AS THEY WERE CROWDED TOGETHER IN NARROW STREETS AND IN HOUSES OR WERE RUNNING AWAY TO THE TEMPLE
3723-171115-0042 NOBODY COULD BE PERSUADED TO WITHHOLD THEIR RIGHT HAND FROM SLAUGHTER BUT THEY SLEW PEOPLE OF ALL AGES LIKE MADMEN THEN IT WAS THAT ANTIGONUS WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO HIS FORMER OR TO HIS PRESENT FORTUNE CAME DOWN FROM THE CITADEL
3723-171115-0044 WAS TO RESTRAIN THE ZEAL OF HIS FOREIGN AUXILIARIES FOR THE MULTITUDE OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE WERE VERY EAGER TO SEE THE TEMPLE AND WHAT WAS SACRED IN THE HOLY HOUSE ITSELF BUT THE KING ENDEAVORED TO RESTRAIN THEM PARTLY BY HIS EXHORTATIONS
3723-171115-0045 PARTLY BY HIS THREATENINGS NAY PARTLY BY FORCE AS THINKING THE VICTORY WORSE THAN A DEFEAT TO HIM IF ANY THING THAT OUGHT NOT TO BE SEEN WERE SEEN BY THEM
3723-171115-0047 AND TOLD HIM THAT HE JUDGED THE DOMINION OF THE HABITABLE EARTH TOO SMALL A COMPENSATION FOR THE SLAUGHTER OF SO MANY CITIZENS
3723-171115-0048 HEROD MADE ANSWER THAT HE WOULD GIVE EVERY ONE OF THE SOLDIERS A REWARD OUT OF HIS OWN MONEY SO HE PURCHASED THE DELIVERANCE OF HIS COUNTRY AND PERFORMED HIS PROMISES TO THEM AND MADE PRESENTS AFTER A MAGNIFICENT MANNER TO EACH SOLDIER
3723-171115-0050 LEADING ANTIGONUS AWAY IN BONDS TO ANTONY THEN DID THE AXE BRING HIM TO HIS END
3723-171115-0051 WHO STILL HAD A FOND DESIRE OF LIFE AND SOME FRIGID HOPES OF IT TO THE LAST BUT BY HIS COWARDLY BEHAVIOR WELL DESERVED TO DIE BY IT FOUR
3723-171115-0053 NOW CLEOPATRA HAD PUT TO DEATH ALL HER KINDRED TILL NO ONE NEAR HER IN BLOOD REMAINED ALIVE AND AFTER THAT SHE FELL A SLAYING THOSE NO WAY RELATED TO HER SO SHE CALUMNIATED THE PRINCIPAL MEN AMONG THE SYRIANS TO ANTONY
3723-171115-0054 AND PERSUADED HIM TO HAVE THEM SLAIN THAT SO SHE MIGHT EASILY GAIN TO BE MISTRESS OF WHAT THEY HAD NAY SHE EXTENDED HER AVARICIOUS HUMOR TO THE JEWS AND ARABIANS
3723-171115-0056 AND HAD CONDUCTED ANTONY IN HIS EXPEDITION AGAINST THE PARTHIANS AS FAR AS EUPHRATES SHE CAME BY APAMIA AND DAMASCUS INTO JUDEA AND THERE DID HEROD PACIFY HER INDIGNATION AT HIM BY LARGE PRESENTS
3723-171115-0057 NOW IT WAS NOT LONG AFTER THIS THAT ANTONY WAS COME BACK FROM PARTHIA
3723-171631-0001 WHENCE CAN WE TAKE A BETTER ARGUMENT A CLEARER DEMONSTRATION THAT ALL THE GREATNESS OF THIS WORLD IS BUILT UPON OPINION OF OTHERS AND HATH IN ITSELF NO REAL BEING NOR POWER OF SUBSISTENCE
3723-171631-0002 THAN FROM THE HEART OF MAN IT IS ALWAYS IN ACTION AND MOTION STILL BUSY STILL PRETENDING TO DO ALL TO FURNISH ALL THE POWERS AND FACULTIES WITH ALL THAT THEY HAVE
3723-171631-0004 BUT AN UNNATURAL HEAT A REBELLIOUS HEAT WILL BLOW UP THE HEART LIKE A MINE IN A MINUTE BUT HOWSOEVER SINCE THE HEART HATH THE BIRTHRIGHT AND PRIMOGENITURE AND THAT IT IS NATURE'S ELDEST SON IN US
3723-171631-0005 THE PART WHICH IS FIRST BORN TO LIFE IN MAN AND THAT THE OTHER PARTS AS YOUNGER BRETHREN AND SERVANTS IN HIS FAMILY HAVE A DEPENDANCE UPON IT IT IS REASON THAT THE PRINCIPAL CARE BE HAD OF IT
3723-171631-0007 MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THAT AS CHILDREN TO THEIR PARENTS AS ALL PERSONS TO ALL KINDS OF SUPERIORS THOUGH OFTENTIMES THOSE PARENTS OR THOSE SUPERIORS
3723-171631-0008 THAT SERVE AND OBEY THEM THAT ARE WEAKER NEITHER DOTH THIS OBLIGATION FALL UPON US BY SECOND DICTATES OF NATURE BY CONSEQUENCES AND CONCLUSIONS ARISING OUT OF NATURE OR DERIVED FROM NATURE BY DISCOURSE
3723-171631-0010 NO MEUM ET TUUM BUT AN UNIVERSAL COMMUNITY OVERALL
3723-171631-0011 WHICH IS IN THE FIRST PLACE TO HAVE CARE OF OUR OWN PRESERVATION TO LOOK FIRST TO OURSELVES FOR THEREFORE DOTH THE PHYSICIAN INTERMIT THE PRESENT CARE OF BRAIN OR LIVER
3723-171631-0013 AND THIS IS THE REWARD OF THE PAINS OF KINGS SOMETIMES THEY NEED THE POWER OF LAW TO BE OBEYED AND WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE OBEYED VOLUNTARILY THEY WHO DO IT DO IT FOR THEIR OWN SAKES
3723-171631-0014 O HOW LITTLE A THING IS ALL THE GREATNESS OF MAN AND THROUGH HOW FALSE GLASSES DOTH HE MAKE SHIFT TO MULTIPLY IT AND MAGNIFY IT TO HIMSELF AND YET THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MISERY OF THIS KING OF MAN
3723-171631-0016 AND THE MALIGNITY OF ILL MEN IS ALSO DIRECTED UPON THE GREATEST AND THE BEST AND NOT ONLY GREATNESS BUT GOODNESS LOSES THE VIGOUR OF BEING AN ANTIDOTE OR CORDIAL AGAINST IT
3723-171631-0017 AND AS THE NOBLEST AND MOST GENEROUS CORDIALS THAT NATURE OR ART AFFORD OR CAN PREPARE IF THEY BE OFTEN TAKEN AND MADE FAMILIAR BECOME NO CORDIALS NOR HAVE ANY EXTRAORDINARY OPERATION
3723-171631-0019 IT WAS BUT A LITTLE HELP THAT HE HAD TO MAKE OTHER THINGS OF THIS EARTH NOTHING CAN BE NEARER NOTHING THAN THIS EARTH AND YET HOW LITTLE OF THIS EARTH IS THE GREATEST MAN HE THINKS HE TREADS UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0020 THAT ALL IS UNDER HIS FEET AND THE BRAIN THAT THINKS SO IS BUT EARTH HIS HIGHEST REGION THE FLESH THAT COVERS THAT IS BUT EARTH AND EVEN THE TOP OF THAT
3723-171631-0022 IF BEFORE HE HAD A BEING HE COULD HAVE SENSE OF THIS MISERY WOULD BUY A BEING HERE UPON THESE CONDITIONS ELEVEN EXPOSTULATION MY GOD MY GOD
3723-171631-0023 ALL THAT THOU ASKEST OF ME IS MY HEART MY SON GIVE ME THY HEART
3723-171631-0025 HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY SERVANT JOB THAT THERE IS NONE LIKE HIM UPON THE EARTH
3723-171631-0026 SHALL MY FEAR SHALL MY ZEAL SHALL MY JEALOUSY HAVE LEAVE TO SAY TO THEE HAST THOU CONSIDERED MY HEART THAT THERE IS NOT SO PERVERSE A HEART UPON EARTH
3723-171631-0028 FOR GIVING THAT THE HEART IS DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND DESPERATELY WICKED WHO CAN KNOW IT
3723-171631-0029 THOU HAST SEARCHED SINCE AND FOUND ALL THESE GRADATIONS IN THE ILL OF OUR HEARTS THAT EVERY IMAGINATION OF THE THOUGHTS OF OUR HEARTS IS ONLY EVIL CONTINUALLY
3723-171631-0031 WITHOUT THEE O SOVEREIGN GOODNESS I COULD NOT KNOW HOW ILL MY HEART WERE THOU HAST DECLARED UNTO ME IN THY WORD THAT FOR ALL THIS DELUGE OF EVIL THAT HATH SURROUNDED ALL HEARTS
3723-171631-0032 YET THOU SOUGHTEST AND FOUNDEST A MAN AFTER THINE OWN HEART
3723-171631-0034 WISE HEARTS IN ONE PLACE AND IN ANOTHER IN A GREAT DEGREE WISE PERFECT HEARTS STRAIGHT HEARTS NO PERVERSENESS WITHOUT AND CLEAN HEARTS NO FOULNESS WITHIN
3723-171631-0035 A HEAVINESS AND DEJECTION OF SPIRIT UPON HIM I HAVE FOUND THESE HEARTS AND A WORSE THAN THESE
3723-171631-0037 AND I HAVE NOT THAT TO THOSE OF THE OTHER KIND THOU GIVEST FAINTNESS OF HEART
3723-171631-0038 IF YOU RETURN TO THE LORD WITH ALL YOUR HEARTS PREPARE YOUR HEARTS UNTO THE LORD

3807-4923-0000 MISSUS VICKERS PALE AND SICK WITH TERROR YET SUSTAINED BY THAT STRANGE COURAGE OF WHICH WE HAVE BEFORE SPOKEN PASSED RAPIDLY UNDER THE OPEN SKYLIGHT AND PREPARED TO ASCEND SYLVIA HER ROMANCE CRUSHED BY TOO DREADFUL REALITY
3807-4923-0001 CLUNG TO HER MOTHER WITH ONE HAND AND WITH THE OTHER PRESSED CLOSE TO HER LITTLE BOSOM THE ENGLISH HISTORY IN HER ALL ABSORBING FEAR SHE HAD FORGOTTEN TO LAY IT DOWN
3807-4923-0003 AND WITH THESE BRAVE FELLOWS I'LL TAKE HER ROUND THE WORLD THE TOUCH OF BOMBAST WAS NOT OUT OF PLACE IT JUMPED SO FAR WITH THE HUMOUR OF THE CONVICTS THAT THEY SET UP A FEEBLE CHEER AT WHICH SYLVIA FROWNED
3807-4923-0004 FRIGHTENED AS SHE WAS THE PRISON BRED CHILD WAS AS MUCH ASTONISHED AT HEARING CONVICTS CHEER AS A FASHIONABLE LADY WOULD BE TO HEAR HER FOOTMAN QUOTE POETRY BATES HOWEVER PRACTICAL AND CALM TOOK QUITE ANOTHER VIEW OF THE CASE
3807-4923-0006 HIS NAUTICAL FANCY PICTURED THE OSPREY HELPLESSLY ROLLING ON THE SWELL OF THE SOUTHERN OCEAN OR HOPELESSLY LOCKED IN THE ICE OF THE ANTARCTIC SEAS AND HE DIMLY GUESSED AT THE FATE OF THE DELUDED TEN
3807-4923-0007 EVEN IF THEY GOT SAFE TO PORT THE CHANCES OF FINAL ESCAPE WERE ALL AGAINST THEM FOR WHAT ACCOUNT COULD THEY GIVE OF THEMSELVES OVERPOWERED BY THESE REFLECTIONS THE HONEST FELLOW MADE ONE LAST EFFORT TO CHARM HIS CAPTORS BACK TO THEIR PRISTINE BONDAGE
3807-4923-0009 LESLY AND ANOTHER BURST INTO A LAUGH AT THIS WILD PROPOSITION BUT REX WHO HAD WEIGHED HIS CHANCES WELL BEFOREHAND FELT THE FORCE OF THE PILOT'S SPEECH AND ANSWERED SERIOUSLY IT'S NO USE TALKING HE SAID SHAKING HIS STILL HANDSOME HEAD
3807-4923-0010 WE HAVE GOT THE BRIG AND WE MEAN TO KEEP HER I CAN NAVIGATE HER THOUGH I AM NO SEAMAN SO YOU NEEDN'T TALK FURTHER ABOUT IT MISTER BATES IT'S LIBERTY WE REQUIRE WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH US ASKED BATES LEAVE YOU BEHIND BATES'S FACE BLANCHED

3807-4923-0013 BUT I HAVE NO WISH TO LEAVE YOU WITHOUT CLOTHES BATES LISTENED IN A SORT OF DISMAL ADMIRATION AT THIS COURTLY CONVICT HE COULD NOT HAVE SPOKEN LIKE THAT HAD LIFE DEPENDED ON IT NOW MY LITTLE LADY CONTINUED REX
3807-4923-0015 FRIGHTENED LET ME PASS PRISONER THE WHOLE DECK BURST INTO A GREAT LAUGH AT THIS AND POOR MISSUS VICKERS PAUSED TREMBLING FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CHILD'S TEMERITY TO THUS TAUNT THE DESPERATE CONVICT WHO HELD THEIR LIVES IN HIS HANDS SEEMED SHEER MADNESS
3807-4923-0016 IN THE BOLDNESS OF THE SPEECH HOWEVER LAY ITS SAFEGUARD REX WHOSE POLITENESS WAS MERE BRAVADO WAS STUNG TO THE QUICK BY THE REFLECTION UPON HIS COURAGE AND THE BITTER ACCENT WITH WHICH THE CHILD HAD PRONOUNCED THE WORD PRISONER
3807-4923-0018 AND REX DARED NOT VENT HIS PASSION ON SO HELPLESS AN OBJECT AS MEN DO IN SUCH CASES HE VEILED HIS ANGER BENEATH AN AFFECTATION OF AMUSEMENT IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT HE WAS NOT MOVED BY THE TAUNT HE SMILED UPON THE TAUNTER MORE GRACIOUSLY THAN EVER
3807-4923-0019 YOUR DAUGHTER HAS HER FATHER'S SPIRIT MADAM SAID HE TO MISSUS VICKERS WITH A BOW BATES OPENED HIS MOUTH TO LISTEN HIS EARS WERE NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO TAKE IN THE WORDS OF THIS COMPLIMENTARY CONVICT HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS THE VICTIM OF A NIGHTMARE HE ABSOLUTELY FELT
3807-4923-0021 SHOUTING TO THEM TO LAY TO BUT FRERE BOILING WITH RAGE AT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TABLES HAD BEEN TURNED ON HIM HAD DETERMINED NOT TO RESIGN HIS LOST AUTHORITY WITHOUT A STRUGGLE DISREGARDING THE SUMMONS HE CAME STRAIGHT ON WITH HIS EYES FIXED ON THE VESSEL
3807-4923-0022 IT WAS NOW NEARLY DARK AND THE FIGURES ON THE DECK WERE INDISTINGUISHABLE THE INDIGNANT LIEUTENANT COULD BUT GUESS AT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE DARKNESS A VOICE HAILED HIM HOLD WATER BACK WATER
3807-4923-0024 AND POISE IT ON THE RAIL THEIR INTENTION WAS BUT TOO EVIDENT AND HONEST BATES LIKE A FAITHFUL WATCH DOG BARKED TO WARN HIS MASTER BLOODTHIRSTY CHESHIRE CAUGHT HIM BY THE THROAT AND FRERE UNHEEDING
3807-4923-0025 RAN THE BOAT ALONGSIDE UNDER THE VERY NOSE OF THE REVENGEFUL REX THE MASS OF IRON FELL HALF IN BOARD UPON THE NOW STAYED BOAT AND GAVE HER STERNWAY WITH A SPLINTERED PLANK VILLAINS CRIED FRERE WOULD YOU SWAMP US
3807-4923-0027 LOOKING UP HE SAW CHESHIRE'S SAVAGE FACE AND HEARD THE CLICK OF THE LOCK AS HE COCKED HIS PIECE THE TWO SOLDIERS EXHAUSTED BY THEIR LONG PULL MADE NO EFFORT TO STAY THE PROGRESS OF THE BOAT
3807-4923-0028 THE DECK OF THE OSPREY HAD BECOME INVISIBLE IN THE DARKNESS FRERE STRUCK HIS FIST UPON THE THWART IN SHEER IMPOTENCE OF RAGE THE SCOUNDRELS HE SAID BETWEEN HIS TEETH THEY'VE MASTERED US WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO DO NEXT
3807-4923-0030 AND THE GLIMMERING WATER WAS VISIBLE A WHITE SPECK WHICH GRADUALLY NEARED THEM COME ALONGSIDE WITH YE HAILED A VOICE OR IT WILL BE THE WORSE FOR YE THEY WANT TO MURDER US SAYS FRERE GIVE WAY MEN
3807-4923-0031 IT'S NO USE MISTER FRERE SAID THE MAN NEAREST HIM WE CAN DO NO GOOD NOW AND THEY WON'T HURT US I DARE SAY YOU DOGS YOU ARE IN LEAGUE WITH THEM BURSTS OUT FRERE PURPLE WITH INDIGNATION DO YOU MUTINY
3807-4923-0033 BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WOULD HAVE RISKED HIS LIFE TO OBEY ORDERS OF HIS OFFICER DID MORE THAN AN HOUR'S REASONING TO CONVINCE MAURICE FRERE OF THE HOPELESSNESS OF RESISTANCE HIS AUTHORITY
3807-4923-0034 HE WAS NOW NO MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE INDEED HE WAS LESS THAN MANY FOR THOSE WHO HELD THE FIREARMS WERE THE RULING POWERS WITH A GROAN HE RESIGNED HIMSELF TO HIS FATE AND LOOKING AT THE SLEEVE OF THE UNDRESS UNIFORM HE WORE
3807-4923-0036 RUSSEN AND FAIR PULLING LYON RILEY CHESHIRE AND LESLY WITH MUSKETS AND JOHN REX IN THE STERN SHEETS
3807-4923-0037 AND A LOADED MUSKET ACROSS HIS KNEES THE WHITE OBJECT WHICH HAD BEEN SEEN BY THE MEN IN THE WHALE BOAT WAS A LARGE WHITE SHAWL WHICH WRAPPED MISSUS VICKERS AND SYLVIA
3807-4923-0039 FRERE ATTEMPTED TO RESIST THIS INDIGNITY BUT CHESHIRE CLAPPING HIS MUSKET TO HIS EAR SWORE HE WOULD BLOW OUT HIS BRAINS IF HE UTTERED ANOTHER SYLLABLE FRERE CATCHING THE MALIGNANT EYE OF JOHN REX
3807-4923-0040 REMEMBERED HOW EASILY A TWITCH OF THE FINGER WOULD PAY OFF OLD SCORES AND WAS SILENT STEP IN HERE SIR IF YOU PLEASE SAID REX WITH POLITE IRONY I AM SORRY TO BE COMPELLED TO TIE YOU BUT I MUST CONSULT MY OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS YOUR CONVENIENCE
3807-4923-0042 POOR MISSUS VICKERS WITH A WOMAN'S QUICK INSTINCT SAW THIS AND EVEN AMID HER OWN TROUBLE FOUND LEISURE TO CONSOLE HIM THE WRETCHES SHE SAID UNDER HER BREATH AS FRERE WAS FLUNG DOWN BESIDE HER TO SUBJECT YOU TO SUCH INDIGNITY
3807-4923-0043 SYLVIA SAID NOTHING AND SEEMED TO SHRINK FROM THE LIEUTENANT PERHAPS IN HER CHILDISH FANCY SHE HAD PICTURED HIM AS COMING TO HER RESCUE
3807-4923-0045 MISTER FRERE PURPLE CLUMSY AND BOUND WAS NOT AT ALL HEROIC NOW MY LADS SAYS REX WHO SEEMED TO HAVE ENDURED THE CAST OFF AUTHORITY OF FRERE WE GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE STAY AT HELL'S GATES OR COME WITH US
3807-4923-0046 THE SOLDIERS PAUSED IRRESOLUTE TO JOIN THE MUTINEERS MEANT A CERTAINTY OF HARD WORK WITH A CHANCE OF ULTIMATE HANGING YET TO STAY WITH THE PRISONERS WAS AS FAR AS THEY COULD SEE TO INCUR THE INEVITABLE FATE OF STARVATION ON A BARREN COAST
3807-4923-0048 GO WITH HIM YE BEGGARS SAID HE AND LEAVE US HONEST MEN OH YE'LL GET A TYING UP FOR THIS THE PHRASE TYING UP BROUGHT WITH IT RECOLLECTION OF THE WORST PORTION OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE THE CAT
3807-4923-0049 AND REVIVED IN THE MINDS OF THE PAIR ALREADY DISPOSED TO BREAK THE YOKE THAT SAT SO HEAVILY UPON THEM A TRAIN OF DISMAL MEMORIES THE LIFE OF A SOLDIER ON A CONVICT STATION WAS AT THAT TIME A HARD ONE HE WAS OFTEN STINTED IN RATIONS
3807-4923-0051 WHICH IS IT TO BE WE'LL GO WITH YOU SAYS THE MAN WHO HAD PULLED THE STROKE IN THE WHALE BOAT SPITTING INTO THE WATER WITH AVERTED FACE UPON WHICH UTTERANCE THE CONVICTS BURST INTO JOYOUS OATHS AND THE PAIR WERE RECEIVED WITH MUCH HAND SHAKING
3807-4923-0052 THEN REX WITH LYON AND RILEY AS A GUARD GOT INTO THE WHALE BOAT AND HAVING LOOSED THE TWO PRISONERS FROM THEIR BONDS ORDERED THEM TO TAKE THE PLACE OF RUSSEN AND FAIR THE WHALE BOAT WAS MANNED BY THE SEVEN MUTINEERS
3807-4923-0054 KEEP YOUR DISTANCE SHOUTED CHESHIRE AS FRERE AND BATES IN OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS BEGAN TO PULL THE JOLLY BOAT TOWARDS THE SHORE AND IN THIS FASHION WAS THE DISMAL LITTLE PARTY CONVEYED TO THE MAINLAND IT WAS NIGHT WHEN THEY REACHED IT
3807-4923-0055 BUT THE CLEAR SKY BEGAN TO THRILL WITH A LATE MOON AS YET UNRISEN AND THE WAVES BREAKING GENTLY UPON THE BEACH GLIMMERED WITH A RADIANCE BORN OF THEIR OWN MOTION FRERE AND BATES JUMPING ASHORE HELPED OUT MISSUS VICKERS SYLVIA AND THE WOUNDED GRIMES
3807-4923-0057 THREE CHEERS FOR OLD ENGLAND AND LIBERTY UPON WHICH A GREAT SHOUT WENT UP ECHOED BY THE GRIM HILLS WHICH HAD WITNESSED SO MANY MISERIES TO THE WRETCHED FIVE THIS EXULTANT MIRTH SOUNDED LIKE A KNELL OF DEATH
3807-4923-0058 GREAT GOD CRIED BATES RUNNING UP TO HIS KNEES IN WATER AFTER THE DEPARTING BOATS WOULD YOU LEAVE US HERE TO STARVE
3807-4955-0001 THAT NOTHING BUT THE DESPERATE NATURE OF THE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED SO DESPERATE A MEASURE THE PERPENDICULAR CLIFFS SEEMED TO RENDER SUCH AN ATTEMPT CERTAIN DESTRUCTION BUT VETCH WHO HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PIER AT THE NECK
3807-4955-0002 KNEW THAT ON THE SOUTHERN POINT OF THE PROMONTORY WAS A STRIP OF BEACH UPON WHICH THE COMPANY MIGHT BY GOOD FORTUNE LAND IN SAFETY WITH SOMETHING OF THE DECISION OF HIS LEADER REX THE CROW DETERMINED AT ONCE THAT IN THEIR DESPERATE PLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY MEASURE
3807-4955-0004 AND BURGESS FOR SOME MINUTES PULLED ALMOST AT RANDOM IN PURSUIT THE SAME TREMENDOUS FLASH OF LIGHTNING WHICH HAD SAVED THE LIFE OF MC NAB BY CAUSING REX TO MISS HIS AIM SHOWED TO THE COMMANDANT THE WHALE BOAT BALANCED ON THE SUMMIT OF AN ENORMOUS WAVE
3807-4955-0005 AND APPARENTLY ABOUT TO BE FLUNG AGAINST THE WALL OF ROCK WHICH MAGNIFIED IN THE FLASH SEEMED FRIGHTFULLY NEAR TO THEM THE NEXT INSTANT BURGESS HIMSELF HIS BOAT LIFTED BY THE SWIFTLY ADVANCING BILLOW
3807-4955-0007 FLOATING IN A POOL OF INK THE GREAT CLIFF WHOSE EVERY SCAR AND CRAG WAS AS DISTINCT AS THOUGH ITS HUGE BULK WAS BUT A YARD DISTANT SEEMED TO SHOOT OUT FROM ITS BASE TOWARDS THE STRUGGLING INSECT A BROAD FLAT STRAW THAT WAS A STRIP OF DRY LAND
3807-4955-0008 THE NEXT INSTANT THE RUSHING WATER CARRYING THE SIX LEGGED ATOM WITH IT CREAMED UP OVER THIS STRIP OF BEACH
3807-4955-0010 SHOUTED TO PUT THE BOAT ABOUT BUT HE MIGHT WITH AS MUCH REASON HAVE SHOUTED AT AN AVALANCHE THE WIND BLEW HIS VOICE AWAY AND EMPTIED IT VIOLENTLY INTO THE AIR A SNARLING BILLOW JERKED THE OAR FROM HIS HAND
3807-4955-0011 DESPITE THE DESPERATE EFFORTS OF THE SOLDIERS THE BOAT WAS WHIRLED UP THE MOUNTAIN OF WATER LIKE A LEAF ON A WATER SPOUT AND A SECOND FLASH OF LIGHTNING SHOWED THEM WHAT SEEMED A GROUP OF DOLLS STRUGGLING IN THE SURF AND A WALNUT SHELL BOTTOM UPWARDS WAS DRIVEN
3807-4955-0013 AS THE MEN SET THE BOAT'S HEAD TO THE WELCOME LINE OF LIGHTS THAT MARKED THE NECK A BLACK SPOT BALANCED UPON A BLACK LINE WAS SWEPT UNDER THEIR STERN AND CARRIED OUT TO SEA AS IT PASSED THEM THIS BLACK SPOT EMITTED A CRY
3807-4955-0014 AND THEY KNEW THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE SHATTERED BOAT'S CREW CLINGING TO AN OAR HE WAS THE ONLY ONE OF EM ALIVE SAID BURGESS BANDAGING HIS SPRAINED WRIST TWO HOURS AFTERWARDS AT THE NECK AND HE'S FOOD FOR THE FISHES BY THIS TIME HE WAS MISTAKEN HOWEVER
3807-4955-0016 REACHED THE UPPER PORTION OF THE SHORE IN SAFETY OF ALL THIS NUMBER ONLY COX WAS LOST HE WAS PULLING STROKE OAR AND BEING SOMETHING OF A LAGGARD STOOD IN THE WAY OF THE CROW WHO SEEING THE IMPORTANCE OF HASTE IN PRESERVING HIS OWN SKIN PLUCKED THE MAN BACKWARDS BY THE COLLAR
3807-4955-0017 AND PASSED OVER HIS SPRAWLING BODY TO THE SHORE COX GRASPING AT ANYTHING TO SAVE HIMSELF CLUTCHED AN OAR AND THE NEXT MOMENT FOUND HIMSELF BORNE OUT WITH THE OVERTURNED WHALE BOAT BY THE UNDER TOW HE WAS DRIFTED PAST HIS ONLY HOPE OF RESCUE THE GUARD BOAT
3807-4955-0019 BEING A STRONG AND VIGOROUS VILLAIN HOWEVER HE CLUNG TENACIOUSLY TO HIS OAR AND EVEN UNBUCKLING HIS LEATHER BELT PASSED IT ROUND THE SLIP OF WOOD THAT WAS HIS SALVATION GIRDING HIMSELF TO IT AS FIRMLY AS HE WAS ABLE
3807-4955-0020 IN THIS CONDITION PLUS A SWOON FROM EXHAUSTION HE WAS DESCRIED BY THE HELMSMAN OF THE PRETTY MARY A FEW MILES FROM CAPE SURVILLE AT DAYLIGHT NEXT MORNING
3807-4955-0022 DURING THAT TIME HE STATED THAT HIS NAME WAS COX THAT HE HAD ESCAPED FROM PORT ARTHUR WITH EIGHT OTHERS THAT JOHN REX WAS THE LEADER OF THE EXPEDITION THAT THE OTHERS WERE ALL DROWNED AND THAT HE BELIEVED JOHN REX HAD BEEN RETAKEN HAVING PLACED BLUNT IN POSSESSION OF THESE PARTICULARS
3807-4955-0023 HE FURTHER SAID THAT IT PRICKED HIM TO BREATHE CURSED JEMMY VETCH THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SEA AND SO IMPENITENTLY DIED BLUNT SMOKED THREE PIPES AND THEN ALTERED THE COURSE OF THE PRETTY MARY TWO POINTS TO THE EASTWARD AND RAN FOR THE COAST
3807-4955-0025 THE PRETTY MARY HUGGING THE COAST AS CLOSELY AS SHE DARED CRAWLED IN THE THIN BREEZE ALL DAY AND SAW NOTHING IT WOULD BE MADNESS TO LAND AT CAPE SURVILLE FOR THE WHOLE STATION WOULD BE ON THE ALERT SO BLUNT AS NIGHT WAS FALLING
3807-4955-0026 STOOD OFF A LITTLE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF PIRATES BAY HE WAS WALKING THE DECK GROANING AT THE FOLLY OF THE EXPEDITION WHEN A STRANGE APPEARANCE ON THE SOUTHERN HORN OF THE BAY MADE HIM COME TO A SUDDEN HALT THERE WAS A FURNACE BLAZING IN THE BOWELS OF THE MOUNTAIN
3807-4955-0028 BLUNT STUMPED INTO THE CABIN AND GOT OUT HIS CHARTS NO LIGHTHOUSE WAS LAID DOWN THERE ONLY A MARK LIKE AN ANCHOR AND A NOTE REMARKABLE HOLE AT THIS POINT A REMARKABLE HOLE INDEED
3807-4955-0029 A REMARKABLE LIME KILN WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE PURPOSE BLUNT CALLED UP HIS MATE WILLIAM STAPLES A FELLOW WHOM SARAH PURFOY'S GOLD HAD BOUGHT BODY AND SOUL WILLIAM STAPLES LOOKED AT THE WAXING AND WANING GLOW FOR A WHILE
3807-4955-0031 GOIN A HOYSTERIN SIR SAID ONE OF THE CREW WITH A GRIN AS BLUNT THREW A BUNDLE INTO THE STERN SHEETS STAPLES THRUST HIS TONGUE INTO HIS CHEEK THE OBJECT OF THE VOYAGE WAS NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD AMONG THE CAREFULLY PICKED CREW
3807-4955-0032 BLUNT HAD NOT CHOSEN MEN WHO WERE LIKELY TO BETRAY HIM THOUGH FOR THAT MATTER REX HAD SUGGESTED A PRECAUTION WHICH RENDERED BETRAYAL ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
3807-4955-0034 THE MADAM'S I'LL BE BOUND AY SHE'S A KNOWING ONE AND THE SINISTER LAUGHTER OF THE PAIR FLOATED ACROSS THE VIOLET WATER GO EASY MAN SAID BLUNT AS THEY NEARED THE SHORE THEY'RE ALL AWAKE AT EAGLEHAWK AND IF THOSE CURSED DOGS GIVE TONGUE
3807-4955-0035 THERE'LL BE A BOAT OUT IN A TWINKLING IT'S LUCKY THE WIND'S OFF SHORE STAPLES LAY ON HIS OAR AND LISTENED THE NIGHT WAS MOONLESS AND THE SHIP HAD ALREADY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW THEY WERE APPROACHING THE PROMONTORY FROM THE SOUTH EAST
3807-4955-0037 THE LIGHT WAS LAMBENT AND UNCERTAIN NOW SINKING ALMOST INTO INSIGNIFICANCE AND NOW LEAPING UP WITH A FIERCENESS THAT CAUSED A DEEP GLOW TO THROB IN THE VERY HEART OF THE MOUNTAIN SOMETIMES A BLACK FIGURE WOULD PASS ACROSS THIS GIGANTIC FURNACE MOUTH
3807-4955-0038 STOOPING AND RISING AS THOUGH FEEDING THE FIRE ONE MIGHT HAVE IMAGINED THAT A DOOR IN VULCAN'S SMITHY
3830-12529-0000 A BEAUTIFUL PEBBLY BEACH EXTENDED ALMOST TO THE WATER'S EDGE EVEN AT LOW TIDE THERE WAS A GRASSY LEVEL SPIT A BACKGROUND OF EVERGREEN GIANT FIR TIMBER
3830-12529-0001 AND SUCH FUEL FOR THE CAMP FIRE BROKEN LIMBS WITH JUST ENOUGH PITCH TO MAKE A CHEERFUL BLAZE AND YET BODY ENOUGH TO LAST WELL
3830-12529-0003 AN ENCAMPMENT OF INDIANS BEING NEAR A PARTY OF THEM SOON VISITED OUR CAMP AND BEGAN MAKING SIGNS FOR TRADE
3830-12529-0004 SAID ONE OF THE MATRONS OF THE PARTY WHAT DOES SHE SAY OLIVER I'M BLESSED IF I KNOW BUT IT LOOKS AS IF SHE WANTED TO SELL SOME CLAMS AFTER CONSIDERABLE DICKERING WITH SIGNS AND GESTURES AND WORDS MANY TIMES REPEATED
3830-12530-0000 SOON WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A FLEET OF SEVEN VESSELS LYING AT ANCHOR IN A LARGE BAY SEVERAL MILES IN EXTENT THE SIGHT OF THOSE SEVEN VESSELS LYING IN THE OFFING MADE A PROFOUND IMPRESSION UPON OUR MINDS
3830-12530-0001 WE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SO MANY SHIPS AT ONE PLACE CURIOUSLY ENOUGH AMONG THEM WAS THE GOOD BARK MARY MELVILLE WITH HER GRUFF MATE AND BIG HEARTED MASTER CAPTAIN BARSTON
3830-12530-0003 AND WE DECIDED ON A HALT TO MAKE OURSELVES ACQUAINTED WITH THE SURROUNDINGS A MILE AND A HALF FROM THE SHORE WE FOUND ALSO FORT STEILACOOM IT WAS SIMPLY THE CAMP OF A COMPANY OF UNITED STATES SOLDIERS QUARTERED IN WOODEN SHELLS OF HOUSES
3830-12530-0004 AND LOG CABINS INTENSE RIVALRY RAN BETWEEN THE TWO TOWNS UPPER AND LOWER STEILACOOM AT THIS TIME AS A RESULT THINGS WERE BOOMING
3830-12530-0006 THEY SEEMED TO BE A LISTLESS LOT WITH NO THOUGHT FOR THE FUTURE OR EVEN FOR THE IMMEDIATE PRESENT THE INDIANS IN THOSE DAYS SEEMED TO WORK OR PLAY BY SPURTS AND SPELLS HERE AND THERE WE SAW A FAMILY
3830-12530-0007 BUT AS A CLASS THEY SEEMED TO ME THE LAZIEST SET OF PEOPLE ON EARTH THAT OPINION WAS MATERIALLY MODIFIED LATER AS I BECAME BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR HABITS I HAVE FOUND JUST AS INDUSTRIOUS PEOPLE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
3830-12530-0009 AFTER A SOBER SECOND THOUGHT WE REALIZED THAT WE HAD NOTHING TO TRADE BUT LABOR AND WE HAD NOT COME AS FAR AS THIS TO BE LABORERS FOR HIRE WE HAD COME TO FIND A PLACE TO MAKE A FARM
3830-12530-0010 AND A FARM WE WERE GOING TO HAVE AGAIN WE SET ABOUT SEARCHING FOR CLAIMS AND THE MORE WE SEARCHED THE LESS WE LIKED THE LOOK OF THINGS FINALLY ON THE FOURTH DAY AFTER A LONG WEARISOME TRAMP WE CAST OFF AT HIGH TIDE
3830-12530-0012 WHY SHOULDN'T I DOZE A LITTLE TOO EVEN IF WE DID MISS SOME OF THE SIGHTSEEING I WAS AROUSED FROM MY NAP BY OLIVER'S EXCLAIMING WHAT IS THAT THEN HALF TO HIMSELF AS I LIVE IT'S A DEER SWIMMING OUT HERE IN THE BAY
3830-12530-0013 IT SURELY CAN'T BE I RESPONDED THREE QUARTERS ASLEEP THAT'S WHAT IT IS HE ASSERTED WE WERE WIDE AWAKE NOW AND GAVE CHASE VERY SOON WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE ANIMAL AND SUCCEEDED IN THROWING A ROPE OVER ITS HORNS
3830-12530-0015 A PERPENDICULAR BLUFF ROSE FROM THE HIGHWATER MARK LEAVING NO PLACE FOR CAMP FIRE OR BED
3830-12530-0016 AND WITH CONTENDING FORCES OF CURRENTS AND COUNTER CURRENTS YET ALL MOVING IN A GENERAL DIRECTION IT WAS OUR FIRST INTRODUCTION TO A GENUINE TIDE RIP THE WATERS BOILED AS IF IN A VERITABLE CALDRON SWELLING UP HERE AND THERE
3830-12530-0018 THE FOLLOWING DAY WE COULD SEE MT RAINIER WITH ITS REFLECTION IN THE PLACID WATERS OF THE BAY THEODORE WINTHROP THE OBSERVANT TRAVELER WHO CAME INTO THESE SAME WATERS A FEW MONTHS LATER AND WROTE OF IT AS MT TACOMA
3830-12530-0019 DESCRIBED IT AS A GIANT MOUNTAIN DOME OF SNOW SEEMING TO FILL THE AERIAL SPACES AS THE IMAGE DISPLACED THE BLUE DEEPS OF TRANQUIL WATER A WONDROUS SIGHT IT WAS AND IS WHATEVER THE NAME NEXT DAY WE ENTERED THE MOUTH OF THE PUYALLUP
3830-12530-0021 AND DRAG OUR CANOE AROUND THE DRIFTS IT WAS A STORY OF CONSTANT TOIL WITH CONSEQUENT DISCOURAGEMENT NOT ENDING UNTIL WE CAMPED
3830-12530-0022 AN INDIAN TRAIL LED UP THE RIVER FROM
3830-12530-0024 OLIVER DID NOT SING AS USUAL WHILE PREPARING FOR CAMP NEITHER DID I HAVE MUCH TO SAY BUT I FELL TO WORK MECHANICALLY PREPARING THE MUCH NEEDED MEAL WE ATE IN SILENCE AND THEN WENT TO SLEEP
3830-12530-0025 OVER HUNDREDS OF MILES OF UNOCCUPIED PRAIRIE LAND AS RICH AS ANYTHING THAT EVER LAY OUT OF DOORS ON OUR WAY FROM INDIANA TO OREGON IN SEARCH OF LAND ON WHICH TO MAKE A HOME HERE AT WHAT WE MIGHT CALL THE END OF OUR ROPE
3830-12530-0027 WHEN WE FELL ASLEEP THAT NIGHT IT WAS WITHOUT VISIONS OF NEW FOUND WEALTH AND YET LATER I DID TACKLE A QUARTER SECTION OF THAT HEAVIEST TIMBER LAND AND NEVER LET UP UNTIL THE LAST TREE LOG STUMP AND ROOT HAD DISAPPEARED
3830-12530-0028 THOUGH OF COURSE NOT ALL CLEARED OFF BY MY OWN HANDS IF WE COULD HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS COMING FOUR MONTHS LATER WE WOULD HAVE REMAINED IN SPITE OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT
3830-12530-0030 LEST SOME SMART FELLOW SHOULD UP AND SAY I WAS DRAWING ON MY IMAGINATION I AM NOT WHEN WE HAD BROKEN CAMP AND WERE SAILING ALONG WE HEARD A DULL SOUND LIKE THAT OFTEN HEARD
3830-12530-0031 IT EXTENDED AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE IN THE DIRECTION WE WERE GOING THE SOUND INCREASED AND BECAME LIKE THE ROAR OF A HEAVY FALL OF RAIN OR HAIL ON WATER AND WE BECAME AWARE THAT IT WAS A VAST SCHOOL OF FISH MOVING SOUTH
3830-12530-0033 ONE WOULD DROP INTO THE BOAT WE SOON DISCOVERED SOME INDIANS FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL
3830-12530-0034 WITH AN IMPROVISED NET WE TOO SOON OBTAINED ALL WE WANTED WHEN WE BEGAN TO GO ON WE WERE EMBARRASSED BY THE MASS OF FISH MOVING IN THE WATER AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE THERE WAS NO END TO THE SCHOOL AHEAD OF US BUT WE FINALLY GOT CLEAR OF THE MOVING MASS
3830-12530-0036 AND THE SWEEP OF THE WIND TO THE NORTH WE HAD A VIEW OF THIRTY MILES OR MORE TO WHERE HORIZON AND WATER BLENDED LEAVING IT DOUBTFUL WHETHER LAND WAS IN SIGHT OR NOT AS WE AFTERWARDS ASCERTAINED WE COULD SEE THE FAMOUS SAN JUAN ISLAND
3830-12530-0037 LATER THE BONE OF CONTENTION BETWEEN OUR GOVERNMENT AND GREAT BRITAIN WHEN THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE UNITED STATES WAS SETTLED PORT TOWNSEND LAY
3830-12530-0039 A MERE SPECK AND GROWING TO A FULL FLEDGED DEEP SEA VESSEL WITH ALL SAILS SET SCUDDING BEFORE THE WIND THE OTHER TWO WERE GRACEFULLY BEATING THEIR WAY OUT
3830-12530-0040 WITH THE BEAUTIFUL OPEN AND COMPARATIVELY LEVEL PLATEAU IN THE BACKGROUND AND TWO OR THREE VESSELS AT ANCHOR IN THE FOREGROUND MADE A PICTURE OF A PERFECT CITY SITE
3830-12530-0042 IN A DEBAUCH THAT WOULD LAST AS LONG AS THEIR MONEY HELD OUT THIS SEEMED TO BE A MORE STALWART RACE OF INDIANS THAN THOSE TO THE SOUTH DOUBTLESS FROM THE BUFFETING RECEIVED IN THE LARGER WATERS THEY WOULD OFTEN GO OUT EVEN TO THE OPEN SEA
3830-12530-0043 ON THEIR FISHING EXCURSIONS IN CANOES MANNED BY THIRTY MEN OR MORE AFTER SPENDING TWO OR THREE DAYS EXPLORING THE COUNTRY WE TURNED BACK TO THE BAY WHERE LAY THE SEVEN SHIPS WE HAD SEEN NEAR STEILACOOM WE REMEMBERED THE TIMBER CAMPS
3830-12530-0045 US BACK IN THE BAY WE SOUGHT BUT THE SHIPS WERE GONE NOT A SAILING CRAFT OF ANY KIND WAS IN SIGHT OF THE LITTLE TOWN
3830-12531-0000 CAN I GET HOME TONIGHT I ASKED MYSELF IT WAS AN AFTERNOON OF THE LAST WEEK OF JUNE IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE AND THE SUN WAS YET HIGH I WAS WELL UP THE LEFT BANK OF THE COWLITZ RIVER HOW FAR I COULD NOT TELL
3830-12531-0002 I WORE A HEAVY WOOLEN SHIRT A SLOUCH HAT AND WORN SHOES BOTH HAT AND SHOES GAVE AMPLE VENTILATION SOCKS I HAD NONE NEITHER HAD I SUSPENDERS AN IMPROVISED BELT
3830-12531-0003 TAKING THEIR PLACE I WAS DRESSED FOR THE RACE AND WAS EAGER FOR THE TRIAL AT OLYMPIA I HAD PARTED WITH MY BROTHER
3830-12531-0005 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF CATCHING COLD FROM LYING ON THE GROUND OR ON CEDAR BOUGHS OR FROM GETTING A GOOD DRENCHING AFTER ALL THE CABIN COULD NOT BE REACHED AS THE TRAIL COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED AT NIGHT
3830-12531-0006 SLACKENING PACE AT NIGHTFALL TO COOL MY SYSTEM GRADUALLY I FINALLY MADE MY CAMP AND SLEPT AS SOUNDLY AS IF ON A BED OF DOWN MY CONSOLATION WAS THAT THE NIGHT WAS SHORT AND I COULD SEE TO TRAVEL BY THREE O'CLOCK
3830-12531-0008 WE NEVER WATCHED FOR THE SUN TO GO DOWN
3830-12531-0009 OR FOR THE BOSS TO QUICKEN OUR STEPS THE DAYS WERE ALWAYS TOO SHORT AND INTEREST IN OUR WORK WAS ALWAYS UNABATED THE CABIN COULD NOT BE SEEN UNTIL THE TRAIL CAME QUITE NEAR IT WHEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF A CURL OF SMOKE I KNEW I WAS ALMOST THERE THEN I SAW THE CABIN
3830-12531-0011 MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY CENTERED ON THE QUESTION OF OUR MOVING TO A NEW HOME WHY AT OLYMPIA EGGS WERE A DOLLAR A DOZEN I SAW THEM SELLING AT THAT THE BUTTER YOU HAVE THERE WOULD BRING YOU A DOLLAR A POUND AS FAST AS YOU COULD WEIGH IT OUT
3830-12531-0012 I SAW STUFF THEY CALLED BUTTER SELL FOR THAT POTATOES ARE SELLING FOR THREE DOLLARS A BUSHEL AND ONIONS AT FOUR EVERYTHING THE FARMER RAISES SELLS HIGH WHO BUYS OH ALMOST EVERYBODY HAS TO BUY
3830-12531-0014 AND A MAN CAN SELL ALL THE SHINGLES HE CAN MAKE AT FOUR DOLLARS A THOUSAND I WAS OFFERED FIVE CENTS A FOOT FOR PILES IF WE HAD BUCK AND DANDY OVER THERE WE COULD MAKE TWENTY DOLLARS A DAY
3830-12531-0015 OFF THE GOVERNMENT LAND OF COURSE ALL HELP THEMSELVES TO WHAT THEY WANT THEN THERE ARE THE FISH AND THE CLAMS AND OYSTERS AND BUT WHAT ABOUT THE LAND FOR THE CLAIM THAT QUESTION WAS A STUMPER THE LITTLE WIFE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF THAT BARGAIN MADE BEFORE WE WERE MARRIED
3830-12531-0017 HOWEVER WE DECIDED TO MOVE AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR THE JOURNEY THE WIFE BABY BEDDING OX YOKE AND LOG CHAIN WERE SENT UP THE COWLITZ IN A CANOE BUCK AND DANDY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0018 ON THIS OCCASION I WAS ILL PREPARED FOR A COOL NIGHT CAMP HAVING NEITHER BLANKET NOR COAT I HAD EXPECTED TO REACH HARD BREAD'S HOTEL WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THE CANOE WOULD STOP OVERNIGHT BUT I COULD NOT MAKE IT SO AGAIN I LAY OUT ON THE TRAIL
3830-12531-0020 NOT SO WELL THE FLOOR OF THE CABIN THAT IS THE HOTEL WAS A GREAT DEAL HARDER THAN THE SAND SPIT WHERE I HAD PASSED THE NIGHT I HAD PLENTY OF PURE FRESH AIR WHILE SHE IN A CLOSED CABIN
3830-12531-0021 AND IN THE SAME ROOM WITH MANY OTHERS HAD NEITHER FRESH AIR NOR FREEDOM FROM CREEPING THINGS THAT MAKE LIFE MISERABLE WITH HER SHOES FOR A PILLOW A SHAWL FOR COVERING SMALL WONDER THAT SHE REPORTED I DID NOT SLEEP A WINK LAST NIGHT
3830-12531-0023 FIFTY MILES MORE OF TRAVEL LAY BEFORE US AND SUCH A ROAD HOWEVER WE HAD ONE CONSOLATION IT WOULD BE WORSE IN WINTER THAN AT THAT TIME
3830-12531-0024 OUR COWS WERE GONE GIVEN FOR PROVENDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF THE OXEN DURING THE DEEP DECEMBER SNOW SO WHEN WE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK WE HAD THE BABY BUCK AND DANDY A TENT AN OX YOKE AND CHAIN ENOUGH CLOTHING AND BEDDING TO KEEP US COMFORTABLE
3830-12531-0026 THIS LAST PROPOSITION WAS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE AND SO NEXT MORNING DRIVING MY OXEN BEFORE ME AND LEAVING WIFE AND BABY TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP
3830-12531-0027 STRANGER THOUGH I WAS TO SAY YES YOU CAN HAVE TWO IF YOU NEED THEM JACKSON HAD SETTLED THERE EIGHT YEARS BEFORE
3830-12531-0029 IT APPEARED THAT I HAD SCARCELY GOT OUT OF SIGHT ON MY TRIP BACK WITH THE OXEN BEFORE ONE OF THOSE ROYAL PIONEER MATRONS HAD COME TO THE CAMP SHE PLEADED AND INSISTED AND FINALLY ALMOST FRIGHTENED THE LITTLE WIFE INTO GOING WITH HER
3830-12531-0030 AND SHARING HER HOUSE WHICH WAS NEAR BY
3830-12535-0000 CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FINDING MY PEOPLE ON LEAVING MY NEWLY FOUND FRIENDS I FACED A DISCOURAGING PROSPECT THE START FOR THE HIGH ARID TABLE LANDS BORDERING THE YAKIMA VALLEY CUT ME LOOSE FROM ALL COMMUNICATION
3830-12535-0001 NO MORE IMMIGRANTS WERE MET UNTIL I REACHED THE MAIN TRAVELED ROUTE BEYOND THE COLUMBIA RIVER THE ROAD LAY THROUGH A FORBIDDING SAGE PLAIN OR RATHER AN UNDULATING COUNTRY COVERED BY SHIFTING SANDS
3830-12535-0003 TO CATCH A GLIMPSE OF THE EXPECTED TRAIN
3830-12535-0004 AND COMPELLED ME TO LEAVE THE ROAD AND DESCEND INTO THE VALLEY FOR WATER
3830-12535-0006 NEAR THE SPRING TO TAKE AN AFTERNOON NAP ROUSING BEFORE SUNDOWN REFRESHED BOBBY AND I TOOK THE TRAIL WITH NEW COURAGE WHEN NIGHT CAME I COULD NOT FIND IT IN MY HEART TO CAMP THE COOL OF THE EVENING INVIGORATED THE PONY AND WE PUSHED ON
3830-12535-0007 FINDING THAT THE ROAD COULD BE FOLLOWED THOUGH BUT DIMLY SEEN I KEPT ON THE TRAIL UNTIL A LATE HOUR WHEN I UNSADDLED AND HOBBLED THE PONY THE SADDLE BLANKET WAS BROUGHT INTO USE AND I WAS SOON OFF IN DREAMLAND FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE DUST THE TRAIL OR THE MORROW
3830-12535-0009 I FOLLOWED HIM AROUND ABOUT OVER THE PLAIN AND THROUGH THE SAGE BRUSH AT A RAPID GAIT FINALLY HE SLACKENED PACE AND I AGAIN BECAME MASTER
3830-12535-0010 ALL THIS ROAMING OVER THE PLAIN AT BOBBY'S HEELS BUT I HAPPENED TO TAKE THE RIGHT COURSE WHEN THE TRAIL WAS FOUND THERE WAS THE SADDLE TO LOOK FOR AND THIS WAS LOCATED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
3830-12535-0012 HALF A MILE DISTANT AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET LOWER TAKING A TRAIL DOWN THE BLUFF THAT SEEMED MORE PROMISING THAN THE WAGON TRACKS I BEGAN TO SEARCH FOR THE ROAD AT THE FOOT OF THE BLUFF
3830-12535-0013 ONLY TO FIND EVERY SEMBLANCE OF A ROAD GONE I LOST MORE THAN A HALF DAY'S PRECIOUS TIME AND AGAIN WAS THROWN INTO ANXIETY LEST I HAD MISSED THE LONG SOUGHT TRAIN THE NEXT INCIDENT THAT I REMEMBER VIVIDLY WAS MY ATTEMPT TO CROSS THE COLUMBIA
3830-12535-0015 THEY SEEMED SURLY AND UNFRIENDLY THEIR BEHAVIOR WAS SO IN CONTRAST TO THAT OF THE INDIANS ON THE SOUND THAT I COULD NOT HELP WONDERING WHAT IT MEANT NO ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE LOST HIS LIFE AT THE HANDS OF THE INDIANS THAT SEASON
3830-12535-0016 UNTIL I WAS HOARSE FROM THE VIOLENT EFFORT FINALLY WHILE SITTING THERE WONDERING WHAT TO DO I SPIED A BLUE SMOKE ARISING FROM A CABIN ON THE OTHER SIDE SOON AFTER I SAW A MAN HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO MY RENEWED EFFORTS TO ATTRACT ATTENTION
3830-12535-0018 AND HAD MET MY PEOPLE THEY WERE CAMPED SOME THIRTY MILES AWAY HE THOUGHT
3830-12535-0019 BUT I COULD NOT WAIT THERE FOR THEM
3830-12535-0021 DUSK CAME ON AND STILL NO SIGNS THEN I SPIED SOME CATTLE GRAZING ON THE UPLAND AND SOON CAME UPON THE CAMP IN A RAVINE THAT HAD SHUT IT FROM VIEW REJOICING AND OUTBURSTS OF GRIEF FOLLOWED I INQUIRED FOR MY MOTHER THE FIRST THING
3830-12535-0022 SHE WAS NOT THERE MONTHS BEFORE SHE HAD BEEN BURIED IN THE SANDS OF THE PLATTE VALLEY MY YOUNGER BROTHER ALSO LAY BURIED ON THE PLAINS NEAR INDEPENDENCE ROCK
3830-12535-0024 THEY HAD THOUGHT THEY WERE ABOUT THROUGH WITH THE JOURNEY YOU CAME TO STAY WITH US DIDN'T YOU I WANT TO BUT WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE AND THE TWO BABIES AT THE ISLAND FATHER SAID SOME ONE MUST GO AND LOOK AFTER THEM SO OLIVER WAS SENT AHEAD
3830-12535-0025 WHILE I WAS TO TAKE HIS PLACE AND HELP THE IMMIGRANTS THROUGH THE NATCHESS PASS IN OUR TRAIN WERE FIFTY OR MORE HEAD OF STOCK SEVEN WAGONS AND SEVENTEEN PEOPLE WE MADE THE TRIP ACROSS THE DIVIDE IN TWENTY TWO DAYS WITHOUT SERIOUS MISHAP OR LOSS
3830-12535-0027 ONE MAN TO EACH WAGON TO DRIVE FOUR TO ACT AS WHEELMEN FATHER AND THE WOMEN ON FOOT OR HORSEBACK TO DRIVE THE STOCK GOD BLESS THE WOMEN FOLKS OF THE PLAINS NOBLER BRAVER MORE UNCOMPLAINING SOULS WERE NEVER KNOWN
3830-12535-0028 I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT SOME ONE OUGHT TO WRITE A JUST TRIBUTE TO THEIR VALOR AND PATIENCE A BOOK OF THEIR HEROIC DEEDS ONE DAY WE ENCOUNTERED A NEWLY FALLEN TREE COCKED UP ON ITS OWN UPTURNED ROOTS FOUR FEET FROM THE GROUND GO AROUND IT WE COULD NOT
3830-12535-0030 DO YOU SAY THAT WE ENDURED GREAT HARDSHIPS THAT DEPENDS UPON THE POINT OF VIEW AS TO THIS RETURN TRIP I CAN TRULY SAY FOR MYSELF THAT IT WAS NOT ONE OF HARDSHIP I ENJOYED OVERCOMING THE DIFFICULTIES AND SO DID THE GREATER NUMBER OF THE COMPANY
3830-12535-0031 BUT BETTER FOOD WAS OBTAINABLE AND THE GOAL WAS NEAR AT HAND IT WAS A POSITIVE PLEASURE THEREFORE TO PASS OVER THE MILES ONE BY ONE
3830-12535-0033 SO MARKED WAS THE CONTRAST HUNDREDS OF CATTLE SHEEP AND HORSES WERE QUIETLY GRAZING SCATTERED OVER THE LANDSCAPE AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE
3857-180923-0000 THE PRECEDING PAGES HAVE OUTLINED THE CAREER OF THE SECOND CONNECTICUT HEAVY ARTILLERY AND HAVE NARRATED SOME OF THE MORE MEMORABLE EVENTS OF ITS HISTORY ENOUGH HAS BEEN TOLD OF WHAT IT DID TO FURNISH GROUNDS FOR DEDUCING WHAT IT WAS
3857-180923-0002 MADE UP THE ORGANIZATION WHOSE NOT UNEVENTFUL EXISTENCE HAS BEEN DESCRIBED THAT THEY WERE BETTER MEN OR WORSE BRAVER MEN OR MORE PATRIOTIC THAN THEIR DESCENDANTS AND SUCCESSORS WOULD PROVE UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS
3857-180923-0003 OR THAN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEIR CONTEMPORARIES WHO DEVOTED THEMSELVES TO THE SAME SERVICE IS NOT TO BE BELIEVED YET TO HAVE PASSED THROUGH SUCH EXPERIENCES AS HAVE BEEN RECOUNTED WHICH BECAME FOR THEM FOR A TIME THE COMMONPLACES OF EVERY DAY LIFE
3857-180923-0005 AS THE BURDEN OF THE BACCALAUREATE SERMONS SO FREQUENTLY TESTIFIES IS CONSIGNED TO A SPECIAL PLACE OF RESPONSIBILITY IN LIFE BECAUSE OF HIS TRAINING THESE MEN SURELY EARNED ONE OF SPECIAL HONOR BY REASON OF THEIRS WHICH WAS TOO
3857-180923-0006 NOT LIKE THE OTHER PREPARATION ALONE BUT ALSO FULFILMENT THE REALIZATION OF HOW TYPICAL IT ALL WAS OF THAT GENERATION AND THAT TIME BRINGS THE CLEAREST UNDERSTANDING OF THE REAL SCOPE OF THE CIVIL WAR
3857-180923-0008 AND WAS ENLISTED AS CAPTAIN OF A COMPANY WHICH HE HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN RECRUITING LIEUTENANT COLONEL NATHANIEL SMITH OF WOODBURY ENTERED THE YALE LAW SCHOOL IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE BUT DID NOT GRADUATE
3857-180923-0009 ILL HEALTH FORCED HIM TO RELINQUISH HIS COMMISSION EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AND UNTIL HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN HE WAS A LEADING CITIZEN OF THE COUNTY JUDGE AUGUSTUS H FENN MAJOR AND BREVET COLONEL
3857-180923-0011 AT THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN HE WAS A LECTURER IN THE YALE LAW SCHOOL AND MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT OF ERRORS
3857-180923-0012 CAPTAIN AND BREVET MAJOR WAS A GRADUATE OF WILLIAMS IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN HE WAS PASTOR OF THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH AT EAST CANAAN WHEN THE REGIMENT WAS ORGANIZED AND WAS ONE OF ITS RECRUITING OFFICERS ADJUTANT THEODORE F VAILL
3857-180923-0014 AND RECEIVED A DEGREE FROM TRINITY IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY FIVE SURGEON HENRY PLUMB AND ASSISTANT SURGEONS ROBERT G HAZZARD AND JOHN W LAWTON WERE ALL GRADUATES OF THE YALE MEDICAL SCHOOL IN THE CLASSES OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE
3857-180923-0015 AND AFTER THE WAR WAS FOR SOME YEARS RECTOR OF SAINT JOHN'S CHURCH IN SALISBURY HE WAS LATER CONNECTED WITH A CHURCH COLLEGE IN MISSOURI WHERE HE DIED IN EIGHTEEN NINETY EIGHT
3857-180923-0017 SERGEANT THEODORE C GLAZIER WAS A GRADUATE OF TRINITY IN THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY AND WAS A TUTOR THERE WHEN HE ENLISTED HE WAS LATER MADE COLONEL OF A COLORED REGIMENT AND SERVED WITH CREDIT IN THAT CAPACITY
3857-180923-0018 CORPORAL EDWARD C HOPSON A GRADUATE OF TRINITY IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR WAS KILLED AT CEDAR CREEK SERGEANT GARWOOD R MERWIN WHO HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE CLASS OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR AT YALE
3857-180923-0020 THERE ARE NOT A FEW OTHER NAMES UPON THE ROLLS OF THE REGIMENT WHICH UPON MORE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAN HAS BEEN POSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT CASE WOULD CERTAINLY BE ADDED TO THE LIST
3857-180923-0021 A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ORGANIZATION WOULD ALSO GIVE A LARGE PLACE TO THE ASSOCIATION OF ITS VETERANS FORMED SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR WHOSE FREQUENT GATHERINGS HAVE MORE THAN A SUPERFICIAL LIKENESS TO THE REUNIONS OF COLLEGE CLASSES
3857-180923-0023 AS A WHOLE THE REGIMENT WAS A BODY THOROUGHLY REPRESENTATIVE NOT ONLY OF THE ARMY OF WHICH IT WAS A FRACTION AN ARMY AS HAS BEEN OFTEN SAID UNLIKE ANY OTHER THE WORLD HAS KNOWN BUT ALSO OF THE POPULATION FROM WHICH IT WAS DRAWN
3857-180923-0024 IT WAS MADE UP OF MEN OF ALMOST ALL CONDITIONS OF LIFE AND OF WIDELY DIFFERENT AGES THOUGH NATURALLY WITH YOUNG MEN IN A LARGE MAJORITY OF MECHANICS FROM THE HOUSATONIC AND NAUGATUCK VALLEYS AND FARMERS BOYS FROM THE HILLS OF MEN OF EDUCATION AND MEN OF NONE
3857-180923-0026 THE RECORDS KEPT BY THE ASSOCIATION REFERRED TO FURNISH SUGGESTIVE REVELATIONS AS TO THE VARIOUS ELEMENTS THAT COMPOSED IT THE NAMES OF MEN OF EVERY SORT AND KIND ARE FOUND UPON THE ROLLS THERE WERE VETERANS OF THE MEXICAN WAR
3857-180923-0027 THERE WERE REFUGEES FROM THE REVOLUTIONARY UPRISINGS IN EUROPE OF EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT THERE WERE SOME WHO HAD SERVED UNDER COMPULSION IN THE ARMIES OF THE SOUTH THERE WERE MEN WHOSE OBVIOUSLY FICTITIOUS NAMES CONCEALED STORIES WHICH COULD BE GUESSED TO BE EXTRAORDINARY
3857-180923-0029 AND EVERY TOWN AMONG US HAS KNOWN SOME OF THEM EVER SINCE AMONG ITS LEADING FIGURES WHILE SOME IN QUARTERS FAR DISTANT HAVE ALSO ATTAINED TO HONORS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS THE RECORDS SHOW
3857-182315-0000 HOW I HATE THE MAN WHO TALKS ABOUT THE BRUTE CREATION WITH AN UGLY EMPHASIS ON BRUTE AS FOR ME I AM PROUD OF MY CLOSE KINSHIP WITH OTHER ANIMALS
3857-182315-0002 AND AMPHIOXUS FISH DINOSAURS AND APES WHO WOULD EXCHANGE THESE FOR THE PALLID COUPLE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN W N P BARBELLION
3857-182315-0003 LAST SUNDAY POTTER TOOK ME OUT DRIVING ALONG UPPER BROADWAY WHERE THOSE LONG ROWS OF TALL NEW APARTMENT HOUSES WERE BUILT A FEW YEARS AGO IT WAS A MILD AFTERNOON AND GREAT CROWDS OF PEOPLE WERE OUT
3857-182315-0005 I TURNED AND ASKED WHY WHAT ABOUT THEM I WASN'T SURE WHETHER HE HAD AN IDEA OR A HEADACHE OTHER CREATURES DON'T DO IT HE REPLIED WITH A DISCOURAGED EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0006 ARE ANY OTHER BEINGS EVER FOUND IN SUCH MASSES BUT VERMIN AIMLESS STARING VACANT MINDED LOOK AT THEM
3857-182315-0008 AND YET AT OTHER TIMES I TOO FEEL LIKE A SPECTATOR AN ALIEN BUT EVEN THEN I HAD NEVER FELT SO ALIEN OR DESPAIRING AS POTTER LET'S REMEMBER I SAID IT'S A SIMIAN CIVILIZATION
3857-182315-0009 POTTER WAS STARING DISGUSTEDLY AT SOME VAUDEVILLE SIGN BOARDS YES I SAID THOSE FOR EXAMPLE ARE DISTINCTIVELY SIMIAN WHY SHOULD YOU FEEL DISAPPOINTMENT AT SOMETHING INEVITABLE AND I WENT ON TO ARGUE THAT IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WE WERE DESCENDED FROM
3857-182315-0011 WHAT COULD YOU EXPECT TWO IF WE HAD BEEN MADE DIRECTLY FROM CLAY THE WAY IT SAYS IN THE BIBLE AND HAD THEREFORE INHERITED NO INTERMEDIATE CHARACTERISTICS
3857-182315-0012 IF A GOD OR SOME PRINCIPLE OF GROWTH HAD GONE THAT WAY TO WORK WITH US HE OR IT MIGHT HAVE MOLDED US IN MUCH MORE SPLENDID FORMS BUT CONSIDERING OUR SIMIAN DESCENT IT HAS DONE VERY WELL
3857-182315-0014 BY VIRTUE OF WHICH EVERY LIVING THING GROWS AND DEVELOPS AND IT TENDS TOWARD SPLENDOR SEEDS BECOME TREES AND WEAK LITTLE NATIONS GROW GREAT BUT THE PUSH OR THE FORCE THAT IS DOING THIS THE YEAST AS IT WERE
3857-182315-0015 HAS TO WORK IN AND ON CERTAIN DEFINITE KINDS OF MATERIAL BECAUSE THIS YEAST IS IN US THERE MAY BE GREAT AND UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES AWAITING MANKIND BUT BECAUSE OF OUR LINE OF DESCENT
3857-182315-0017 LITTLE REALIZING HOW WE HIS GREATGRANDSONS WOULD SMILE WRYLY AT HIM MUCH AS OUR OWN DESCENDANTS MAY SHUDDER AT US AGES HENCE THE VARIOUS ANIMALS WERE DESPERATELY COMPETING FOR POWER THEY COULDN'T OR DIDN'T LIVE AS EQUALS
3857-182315-0018 CERTAIN GROUPS SOUGHT THE HEADSHIP MANY STRANGE FORGOTTEN DYNASTIES ROSE MET DEFIANCE AND FELL IN THE END IT WAS OUR ANCESTORS WHO WON AND BECAME SIMIAN KINGS AND BEQUEATHED A WHOLE PLANET TO US
3857-182315-0020 FAMILIAR WITH THE WAYS OF EVOLUTION ELSEWHERE IN THE UNIVERSE WE NATURALLY SHOULD HAVE WONDERED WHAT COURSE IT WOULD TAKE ON THIS EARTH EVEN IN THIS OUT OF THE WAY CORNER OF THE COSMOS WE MIGHT HAVE REFLECTED AND ON THIS TINY STAR
3857-182315-0021 IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO CONSIDER THE TREND OF EVENTS WE SHOULD HAVE TRIED TO APPRAISE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AS THEY WANDERED AROUND EACH WITH ITS OWN SET OF GOOD AND BAD CHARACTERISTICS WHICH GROUP WE'D HAVE WONDERED WOULD EVER CONTRIVE TO RULE ALL THE REST
3857-182315-0023 WE MIGHT FIRST HAVE CONSIDERED THE LEMURS OR APES THEY HAD HANDS AESTHETICALLY VIEWED THE POOR SIMIANS WERE SIMPLY GROTESQUE BUT TRAVELERS WHO KNEW OTHER PLANETS MIGHT HAVE KNOWN WHAT BEAUTY MAY SPRING FROM AN UNCOUTH BEGINNING IN THIS MAGIC UNIVERSE
3857-182315-0024 STILL THOSE FROWSY UNLOVELY HORDES OF APES AND MONKEYS WERE SO COMPLETELY LACKING IN SIGNS OF KINGSHIP THEY WERE SO FLIGHTY TOO IN THEIR WAYS AND HAD SO LITTLE PURPOSE AND SO MUCH LOVE FOR ABSURD AND IDLE CHATTER
3857-182315-0026 THE BEES OR THE ANTS MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO US MORE PROMISING THEIR SMALLNESS OF SIZE WAS NOT NECESSARILY TOO MUCH OF A HANDICAP THEY COULD HAVE MADE POISON THEIR WEAPON FOR THE SUBJUGATION OF RIVALS
3857-182315-0027 AND IN THESE ORDERLY INSECTS THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY A CAPACITY FOR LABOR AND CO OPERATIVE LABOR AT THAT WHICH COULD CARRY THEM FAR WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A MARKED GENIUS GREAT GIFTS OF THEIR OWN
3857-182315-0029 NO DERISION OF EUGENICS NO THIEVES PERHAPS NO CRIME AT ALL ANTS ARE GOOD CITIZENS THEY PLACE GROUP INTERESTS FIRST BUT THEY CARRY IT SO FAR THEY HAVE FEW OR NO POLITICAL RIGHTS
3857-182315-0030 AN ANT DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTE APPARENTLY HE JUST HAS HIS DUTIES THIS QUALITY MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THEIR HAVING GROUPS WARS THE EGOTISM OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPIRITS IS ALLOWED SCANT EXPRESSION
3857-182315-0032 I WISH I COULD TRULY SAY INHUMAN BUT CONVERSELY ANTS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSELFISH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE SKILFUL INGENIOUS THEIR NESTS AND BUILDINGS ARE RELATIVELY LARGER THAN MAN'S
3857-182315-0033 THE SCIENTISTS SPEAK OF THEIR PAVED STREETS VAULTED HALLS THEIR HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT DOMESTICATED ANIMALS THEIR PLUCK AND INTELLIGENCE THEIR INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE THEIR CHASTE AND INDUSTRIOUS LIVES
3857-182315-0035 A THOUGHTFUL OBSERVER WOULD HAVE WEIGHED ALL THESE EXCELLENT QUALITIES WHEN WE THINK OF THESE CREATURES AS LITTLE MEN WHICH IS ALL WRONG OF COURSE WE SEE THEY HAVE THEIR FAULTS TO OUR EYES THEY SEEM TOO ORDERLY FOR INSTANCE
3857-182315-0036 REPRESSIVELY SO THEIR WAYS ARE MORE FIXED THAN THOSE OF THE OLD EGYPTIANS AND THEIR INDUSTRY IS PAINFUL TO THINK OF IT'S HYPER CHINESE BUT WE MUST REMEMBER THIS IS A SIMIAN COMMENT
3857-182315-0038 AND INSTEAD OF MERELY STRUGGLING WITH NATURE FOR IT THEY ALSO FIGHT OTHER ANTS THE CUSTOM OF PLUNDER SEEMS TO BE A PART OF MOST OF THEIR WARS THIS HAS GONE ON FOR AGES AMONG THEM AND CONTINUES TODAY
3857-182315-0039 RAIDS FEROCIOUS COMBATS AND LOOT ARE PART OF AN ANT'S REGULAR LIFE ANT REFORMERS IF THERE WERE ANY MIGHT LAY THIS TO THEIR PROPERTY SENSE AND TALK OF ABOLISHING PROPERTY AS A CURE FOR THE EVIL
3857-182315-0041 THEY CAN'T BEAR TO STOP THEY KEEP RIGHT ON WORKING THIS MEANS THAT ANTS DO NOT CONTEMPLATE THEY HEED NOTHING OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN LITTLE ROUNDS IT IS ALMOST AS THOUGH THEIR FONDNESS FOR LABOR HAD CLOSED FAST THEIR MINDS
3857-182315-0042 CONCEIVABLY THEY MIGHT HAVE DEVELOPED INQUIRING MINDS BUT THIS WOULD HAVE RUN AGAINST THEIR STRONGEST INSTINCTS THE ANT IS KNOWING AND WISE BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH TO TAKE A VACATION
3857-182315-0044 IT IS THE SERVANT OF INSTINCT IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE TOLD THE ANTS THAT INCESSANT TOIL WAS USEFUL AND GOOD TOIL HAS BROUGHT YOU UP FROM THE RUCK OF THINGS REASON WOULD HAVE PLAUSIBLY SAID
3857-182315-0045 IT'S BY VIRTUE OF FEVERISH TOIL THAT YOU HAVE BECOME WHAT YOU ARE BEING ENDLESSLY INDUSTRIOUS IS THE BEST ROAD FOR YOU TO THE HEIGHTS
3857-182317-0001 BUT THEY HAVE LOST THEIR CHANCE OF KINGSHIP THROUGH WORSHIPPING US THE DOG'S FINER QUALITIES CAN'T BE PRAISED TOO WARMLY THERE IS A PURITY ABOUT HIS DEVOTION WHICH MAKES MERE MEN FEEL SPEECHLESS BUT WITH ALL LOVE FOR DOGS
3857-182317-0002 ONE MUST GRANT THEY ARE VASSALS NOT RULERS THEY ARE TOO PARASITIC THE ONE WILLING SERVANT CLASS OF THE WORLD AND WE HAVE BETRAYED THEM BY MAKING UNDER SIMIANS OF THEM
3857-182317-0004 DOGS HAVE MORE LOVE THAN INTEGRITY THEY'VE BEEN TRUE TO US YES BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN TRUE TO THEMSELVES PIGS THE PIG IS REMARKABLY INTELLIGENT AND BRAVE BUT HE'S GROSS
3857-182317-0005 AND GROSSNESS DELAYS ONE'S ACHIEVEMENT IT TAKES SO MUCH TIME THE SNAKE TOO THOUGH WISE HAS A WAY OF EATING HIMSELF INTO STUPORS IF SUPER SNAKE MEN HAD HAD BANQUETS THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO VAST TO DESCRIBE
3857-182317-0007 HE WAS PLASTIC TOO HE HAD LEARNED TO EAT MANY FOODS AND ENDURE MANY CLIMATES ONCE SOME SAY THIS RACE EXPLORED THE GLOBE THEIR BONES ARE FOUND EVERYWHERE IN SOUTH AMERICA EVEN
3857-182317-0008 SO THE ELEPHANTS COLUMBUS MAY HAVE FOUND SOME ROAD HERE BEFORE OURS THEY ARE COSMOPOLITANS THESE SUAVE AND WELL BRED BEINGS THEY HAVE RICH EMOTIONAL NATURES LONG MEMORIES LOYALTY THEY ARE STEADY AND SURE
3857-182317-0010 AND THAT THE MONKEY MEN WERE GETTING AHEAD WERE THEY TOO GREAT MINDED AND DECENT TO EXTERMINATE THEIR PUNY RIVALS IT MAY HAVE BEEN THEIR TOLERANCE AND PATIENCE THAT BETRAYED THEM THEY WAIT TOO LONG BEFORE THEY RESENT AN IMPOSITION OR INSULT
3857-182317-0011 JUST AS ANTS ARE TOO ENERGETIC AND CATS TOO SHREWD FOR THEIR OWN HIGHEST GOOD SO THE ELEPHANTS SUFFER FROM TOO MUCH PATIENCE THEIR EXHIBITIONS OF IT MAY SEEM SUPERB SUCH POWER AND SUCH RESTRAINT COMBINED ARE NOBLE
3857-182317-0013 ALL SPECIES MUST SURRENDER UNCONDITIONALLY THOSE ARE OUR TERMS AND COME AND LIVE IN BARNS ALONGSIDE US OR ON US AS PARASITES THE CREATURES THAT WANT TO LIVE A LIFE OF THEIR OWN WE CALL WILD IF WILD
3857-182317-0014 THEN NO MATTER HOW HARMLESS WE TREAT THEM AS OUTLAWS AND THOSE OF US WHO ARE SPECIALLY WELL BROUGHT UP SHOOT THEM FOR FUN SOME MIGHT BE OUR FRIENDS WE DON'T WISH IT WE KEEP THEM ALL TERRORIZED
3857-182317-0016 SOON ALL WILL BE GONE WE GIVE NEITHER FREEDOM NOR LIFE ROOM TO THOSE WE DEFEAT IF WE HAD BEEN AS STRONG AS THE ELEPHANTS WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KINDER WHEN GREAT POWER COMES NATURALLY TO PEOPLE
3857-182317-0017 IT IS USED MORE URBANELY WE USE IT AS PARVENUS DO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE THE ELEPHANT BEING BORN TO IT IS EASY GOING CONFIDENT TOLERANT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A MORE HUMANE KING
3857-182317-0019 THAT CAN OBVIOUSLY BE USED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR THIS OR THAT PURPOSE MANY CREATURES USE OBJECTS AS MATERIALS AS BIRDS USE TWIGS FOR NESTS BUT THE STEP THAT NO ANIMAL TAKES IS LEARNING FREELY TO USE THINGS AS INSTRUMENTS
3857-182317-0020 WHEN AN ELEPHANT PLUCKS OFF A BRANCH AND SWISHES HIS FLANKS AND THUS KEEPS AWAY INSECTS HE IS USING A TOOL BUT HE DOES IT ONLY BY A VAGUE AND HAPHAZARD ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS IF HE ONCE BECAME A CONSCIOUS USER OF TOOLS
3857-182317-0022 AND ALL THAT WHILE THE CONTEST FOR LEADERSHIP BLINDLY WENT ON WITHOUT ANY SPECIES MAKING USE OF THIS OBVIOUS AID THE LESSON TO BE LEARNED WAS SIMPLE THE REWARD WAS THE RULE OF A PLANET YET ONLY ONE SPECIES OUR OWN
3857-182317-0023 HAS EVER HAD THAT MUCH BRAINS IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT OTHER OBVIOUS LESSONS MAY STILL BE UNLEARNED IT IS NOT NECESSARILY STUPID HOWEVER TO FAIL TO USE TOOLS TO USE TOOLS INVOLVES USING REASON
3857-182317-0025 BUT WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHICH HAS THE MORE VALUE A SUDDEN VISION COMES TO ME OF ONE OF THE FIRST FAR AWAY APE MEN WHO TRIED TO USE REASON INSTEAD OF INSTINCT AS A GUIDE FOR HIS CONDUCT I IMAGINE HIM PERCHED IN HIS TREE
3857-182317-0026 TORN BETWEEN THOSE TWO VOICES WAILING LOUDLY AT NIGHT BY A RIVER IN HIS PUZZLED DISTRESS MY POOR FAR OFF BROTHER
3857-182317-0028 SOME QUENCHLESS DESIRE TO URGE THEM ON AND ON AND ALSO ADAPTABILITY OF A THOUSAND KINDS TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THE RHINOCEROS CARES LITTLE FOR ADAPTABILITY HE SLOGS THROUGH THE WORLD BUT WE
3857-182317-0029 WE ARE EXPERTS ADAPTABILITY IS WHAT WE DEPEND ON WE TALK OF OUR MASTERY OF NATURE WHICH SOUNDS VERY GRAND BUT THE FACT IS WE RESPECTFULLY ADAPT OURSELVES FIRST TO HER WAYS
3857-182317-0031 BACK OF IT THERE MUST BE SOME SPUR TO MAKE US USE OUR ADROITNESS WHY DON'T WE ALL DIE OR GIVE UP WHEN WE'RE SICK OF THE WORLD BECAUSE THE LOVE OF LIFE IS REENFORCED IN MOST ENERGIZED BEINGS
3857-182317-0032 BY SOME LONGING THAT PUSHES THEM FORWARD IN DEFEAT AND IN DARKNESS ALL CREATURES WISH TO LIVE AND TO PERPETUATE THEIR SPECIES OF COURSE BUT THOSE TWO WISHES ALONE EVIDENTLY DO NOT CARRY ANY RACE FAR
3879-173592-0000 SAGACIOUS BOLD AND RESTLESS HE PUSHED HIS WAY FROM TOWN TO TOWN AND PRETENDED TO HAVE REACHED THE MYSTERIOUS MOUNTAINS OF APPALACHE HE SENT TO THE FORT MANTLES WOVEN WITH FEATHERS QUIVERS COVERED WITH CHOICE FURS
3879-173592-0001 ARROWS TIPPED WITH GOLD WEDGES OF A GREEN STONE LIKE BERYL OR EMERALD AND OTHER TROPHIES OF HIS WANDERINGS A GENTLEMAN NAMED GROTAUT TOOK UP THE QUEST AND PENETRATED TO THE DOMINIONS OF HOSTAQUA
3879-173592-0003 A HUMBLER ADVENTURER WAS PIERRE GAMBIE A ROBUST AND DARING YOUTH
3879-173592-0004 AND WAS NOW A SOLDIER UNDER LAUDONNIERE THE LATTER GAVE HIM LEAVE TO TRADE WITH THE INDIANS A PRIVILEGE WHICH HE USED SO WELL THAT HE GREW RICH WITH HIS TRAFFIC BECAME PRIME FAVORITE WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLAND OF EDELANO
3879-173592-0006 INDIANS FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF CAPE CANAVERAL BROUGHT TO THE FORT TWO SPANIARDS WRECKED FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE ON THE SOUTHWESTERN EXTREMITY OF THE PENINSULA
3879-173592-0007 THEY TOLD OF THE KING OF CABS ON WHOSE DOMAINS THEY HAD BEEN WRECKED A CHIEF MIGHTY IN STATURE AND IN POWER IN ONE OF HIS VILLAGES WAS A PIT SIX FEET DEEP AND AS WIDE AS A HOGSHEAD
3879-173592-0009 TO HOLD CONVERSE IN SECRET WITH SUPERNAL OR INFERNAL POWERS AND EACH YEAR HE SACRIFICED TO HIS GODS ONE OF THE SPANIARDS WHOM THE FORTUNE OF THE SEA HAD CAST UPON HIS SHORES
3879-173592-0010 THE NAME OF THE TRIBE IS PRESERVED IN THAT OF THE RIVER CABOOSA IN CLOSE LEAGUE WITH HIM WAS THE MIGHTY OATHCAQUA DWELLING NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL WHO GAVE HIS DAUGHTER A MAIDEN OF WONDROUS BEAUTY
3879-173592-0012 IN THE MIDST OF A LAKE WHO PUT THE WARRIORS TO FLIGHT BORE THE MAIDENS CAPTIVE TO THEIR WATERY FASTNESS ESPOUSED THEM ALL AND WE ARE ASSURED
3879-173592-0013 BEGGED FOR TEN ARQUEBUSIERS TO AID HIM ON A NEW RAID
3879-173592-0015 WITH THRICE THE FORCE DEMANDED THREE HUNDRED THIRNAGOAS AND THIRTY FRENCHMEN TOOK UP THEIR MARCH THROUGH THE PINE BARRENS OUTINA'S CONJURER WAS OF THE NUMBER AND HAD WELLNIGH RUINED THE ENTERPRISE
3879-173592-0016 WITH HIDEOUS GRIMACES HOWLINGS AND CONTORTIONS HE WROUGHT HIMSELF INTO A PROPHETIC FRENZY AND PROCLAIMED TO THE ASTOUNDED WARRIORS
3879-173592-0018 AND NOW IN AMPLE MEASURE THE FRENCH BEGAN TO REAP THE HARVEST OF THEIR FOLLY CONQUEST GOLD AND MILITARY OCCUPATION HAD ALONE BEEN THEIR AIMS
3879-173592-0019 NOT A ROD OF GROUND HAD BEEN STIRRED WITH THE SPADE THEIR STORES WERE CONSUMED AND THE EXPECTED SUPPLIES HAD NOT COME THE INDIANS TOO WERE HOSTILE SATOURIONA HATED THEM AS ALLIES OF HIS ENEMIES
3879-173592-0021 THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY WHEN RIBAUT AND HIS COMPANIONS FULL OF DELIGHTED ANTICIPATION HAD FIRST EXPLORED
3879-173592-0022 FOR WITHIN THE PRECINCT OF FORT CAROLINE A HOMESICK SQUALID BAND DEJECTED AND WORN DRAGGED THEIR SHRUNKEN LIMBS ABOUT THE SUN SCORCHED AREA OR LAY STRETCHED IN LISTLESS WRETCHEDNESS UNDER THE SHADE OF THE BARRACKS
3879-173592-0024 THEY WERE LAMENTABLY UNFIT FOR THE WORK THEY HAD TAKEN IN HAND OUR MISERIE SAYS LAUDONNIERE WAS SO GREAT THAT ONE WAS FOUND THAT GATHERED UP ALL THE FISH BONES THAT HE COULD FINDE WHICH HE DRIED
3879-173592-0025 AND BEATE INTO POWDER TO MAKE BREAD THEREOF THE EFFECTS OF THIS HIDEOUS FAMINE APPEARED INCONTINENTLY AMONG US FOR OUR BONES EFTSOONES BEGANNE TO CLEAVE SO NEERE UNTO THE SKINNE
3879-173592-0027 TO DESCRY THE ANXIOUSLY EXPECTED SAIL HAD COLIGNY LEFT THEM TO PERISH OR HAD SOME NEW TEMPEST OF CALAMITY LET LOOSE UPON FRANCE DROWNED THE MEMORY OF THEIR EXILE
3879-173592-0028 IN VAIN THE WATCHMAN ON THE HILL SURVEYED THE SOLITUDE OF WATERS A DEEP DEJECTION FELL UPON THEM
3879-173592-0030 LEST THEY SHOULD PAY THE PENALTY OF THEIR EXTORTION THEY WOULD NOT ENTER THE FORT
3879-173592-0031 BEYOND GUNSHOT WAITING FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COME OUT TO THEM OFTENTIMES SAYS LAUDONNIERE OUR POOR SOLDIERS WERE CONSTRAINED TO GIVE AWAY THE VERY SHIRTS FROM THEIR BACKS TO GET ONE FISH IF AT ANY TIME THEY SHEWED UNTO THE SAVAGES
3879-173592-0033 THE SPRING WORE AWAY AND NO RELIEF APPEARED ONE THOUGHT NOW ENGROSSED THE COLONISTS THAT OF RETURN TO FRANCE VASSEUR'S SHIP THE BRETON STILL REMAINED IN THE RIVER
3879-173592-0034 AND THEY HAD ALSO THE SPANISH BRIGANTINE BROUGHT BY THE MUTINEERS BUT THESE VESSELS WERE INSUFFICIENT AND THEY PREPARED TO BUILD A NEW ONE THE ENERGY OF REVIVING HOPE LENT NEW LIFE TO THEIR EXHAUSTED FRAMES
3879-173592-0036 THE MAIZE BEGAN TO RIPEN AND THIS BROUGHT SOME RELIEF BUT THE INDIANS EXASPERATED AND GREEDY SOLD IT WITH RELUCTANCE AND MURDERED TWO HALF FAMISHED FRENCHMEN WHO GATHERED A HANDFUL IN THE FIELDS
3879-173592-0037 ONE ASTINA THE PLUNDER OF WHOSE VILLAGES WOULD YIELD AN AMPLE SUPPLY THE OFFER WAS ACCEPTED OTTIGNY AND VASSEUR SET OUT BUT WERE GROSSLY DECEIVED LED AGAINST A DIFFERENT ENEMY
3879-173592-0039 AND JOINED BY ALL THEIR COMRADES FIERCELY DEMANDED TO BE LED AGAINST OUTINA TO SEIZE HIM PUNISH HIS INSOLENCE AND EXTORT FROM HIS FEARS THE SUPPLIES WHICH COULD NOT BE LOOKED FOR FROM HIS GRATITUDE THE COMMANDANT WAS FORCED TO COMPLY
3879-173592-0040 THOSE WHO COULD BEAR THE WEIGHT OF THEIR ARMOR PUT IT ON EMBARKED TO THE NUMBER OF FIFTY IN TWO BARGES AND SAILED UP THE RIVER UNDER LAUDONNIERE HIMSELF HAVING REACHED OUTINA'S LANDING THEY MARCHED INLAND ENTERED HIS VILLAGE
3879-173592-0042 UTTERED MOANS AND OUTCRIES FROM THE STRAND YET NO RANSOM WAS OFFERED SINCE REASONING FROM THEIR OWN INSTINCTS THEY NEVER DOUBTED THAT AFTER THE PRICE WAS PAID THE CAPTIVE WOULD BE PUT TO DEATH LAUDONNIERE
3879-173592-0043 WAITED TWO DAYS AND THEN DESCENDED THE RIVER WITH HIS PRISONER
3879-174923-0001 IT WOULD COST BUT LITTLE AND THAT LITTLE SHOULD HE BE SUCCESSFUL WOULD FALL ON THE SHOULDERS OF MISTER BROWBOROUGH SHOULD HE KNOCK OFF EIGHT VOTES AND LOSE NONE HIMSELF HE WOULD BE MEMBER FOR TANKERVILLE
3879-174923-0002 HE KNEW THAT MANY VOTES HAD BEEN GIVEN FOR BROWBOROUGH WHICH IF THE TRUTH WERE KNOWN OF THEM WOULD BE KNOCKED OFF AND HE DID NOT KNOW THAT THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ANY ONE OF THOSE BY WHICH HE HAD BEEN SUPPORTED
3879-174923-0004 AS FOR GOING BACK TO DUBLIN THAT WAS NOW OUT OF THE QUESTION HE HAD ENTERED UPON A FEVERISH STATE OF EXISTENCE IN WHICH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE IN IRELAND
3879-174923-0005 HE MUST VANISH OUT OF THE WORLD
3879-174923-0007 SO YOU'RE AT THE OLD GAME MISTER FINN SAID HIS LANDLORD YES AT THE OLD GAME I SUPPOSE IT'S THE SAME WITH YOU NOW MISTER BUNCE HAD BEEN A VERY VIOLENT POLITICIAN
3879-174923-0008 PRETTY MUCH THE SAME MISTER FINN I DON'T SEE THAT THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER THAN THEY USED TO BE THEY TELL ME AT THE PEOPLE'S BANNER OFFICE THAT THE LORDS HAVE HAD AS MUCH TO DO WITH THIS ELECTION AS WITH ANY THAT EVER WENT BEFORE IT
3879-174923-0010 NOT BUT WHAT HE'S DISGRACED HIMSELF BY WHAT HE'S BEEN AND DONE NOW MISTER SLIDE IN FORMER DAYS HAD BEEN THE EDITOR OF THE PEOPLE'S BANNER
3879-174923-0011 BUT WHAT A MAN KEEPS IN THE WAY OF RELIGION FOR HIS OWN USE IS NEVER NOTHING TO ME AS WHAT I KEEPS IS NOTHING TO HIM I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T KEEP MUCH MISTER BUNCE AND THAT'S NOTHING TO YOU NEITHER IS IT SIR NO INDEED
3879-174923-0013 THE MONEY WOULD COME TO US TO DO AS WE PLEASED WITH IT WE PROVED ALL THAT WHEN WE PARED THEM DOWN A BIT WHAT'S AN ECCLESIASTICAL COMMISSION ONLY ANOTHER NAME FOR A BOX TO PUT THE MONEY INTO TILL YOU WANT TO TAKE IT OUT AGAIN
3879-174923-0014 JUST AS THE THEATRES ARE MISTER FINN OR THE GIN SHOPS THEN I KNOW THERE'S A DEAL MORE TO BE DONE BEFORE HONEST MEN CAN COME BY THEIR OWN YOU'RE RIGHT ENOUGH MISTER FINN YOU ARE AS FAR AS CHURCHES GO AND YOU WAS RIGHT TOO WHEN YOU CUT AND RUN OFF THE TREASURY BENCH
3879-174923-0016 BUT AFTER ALL THERE'S BEEN BETWIXT YOU AND US IT WOULDN'T BE NATURAL TO PASS IT BY WITHOUT ONE WORD WOULD IT MISTER FINN WELL YES HE'S JUST THE SAME MAN AS EVER
3879-174923-0017 JUST AS HE USED TO DO AND NEVER GOT SO MUCH OUT OF IT
3879-174923-0019 IF HE'D DRINK IT WHICH HE NEVER DOES I THINK I'D BEAR IT BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO THAT NASTY UNION AND YOUNG JACK WRITES AS WELL AS HIS FATHER PRETTY NIGH MISTER FINN WHICH IS A COMFORT MISTER BUNCE WAS A JOURNEYMAN SCRIVENER AT A LAW STATIONER'S
3879-174923-0020 AND KEEPS HIS SELF BUT HE DON'T BRING HOME HIS MONEY NOR YET IT CAN'T BE EXPECTED MISTER FINN I KNOW WHAT THE YOUNG UNS WILL DO AND WHAT THEY WON'T AND MARY JANE IS QUITE HANDY ABOUT THE HOUSE NOW ONLY SHE DO BREAK THINGS
3879-174923-0022 NOW LORD CHILTERN WAS AGAIN HIS VERY INTIMATE FRIEND AND THERE HAD USED TO SIT A NEEDY MONEY LENDER WHOM
3879-174923-0023 ALAS ALAS HOW SOON MIGHT HE NOW REQUIRE THAT MONEY LENDER'S SERVICES AND THEN HE RECOLLECTED HOW HE HAD LEFT THESE ROOMS TO GO INTO OTHERS GRANDER AND MORE APPROPRIATE TO HIS LIFE WHEN HE HAD FILLED HIGH OFFICE UNDER THE STATE
3879-174923-0025 WHEN THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN WOULD HE BE ABLE TO INSERT THE POINT AGAIN BETWEEN THOSE TWO DIFFICULT SHELLS WOULD THE COUNTESSES ONCE MORE BE KIND TO HIM WOULD DRAWING ROOMS BE OPENED TO HIM AND SOMETIMES OPENED TO HIM AND TO NO OTHER
3879-174923-0026 THEN HE THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS IN WHICH WONDERFUL THINGS HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM SINCE THAT HE HAD BEEN A MARRIED MAN AND THOSE SPECIAL DRAWING ROOMS AND THOSE WONDERFUL WORDS HAD IN NO DEGREE ACTUATED HIM IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE
3879-174923-0028 WHILE HIS YOUNG WIFE WAS LIVING HE HAD KEPT HIS SIGHS DOWN SO THAT SHE SHOULD NOT HEAR THEM BUT HE HAD BEEN FORCED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HIS NEW LIFE HAD BEEN VAPID AND FLAVOURLESS NOW HE HAD BEEN TEMPTED BACK AGAIN TO THE OLD HAUNTS
3879-174923-0029 WOULD THE COUNTESSES CARDS BE SHOWERED UPON HIM AGAIN ONE CARD OR RATHER NOTE HAD REACHED HIM WHILE HE WAS YET AT TANKERVILLE REMINDING HIM OF OLD DAYS IT WAS FROM MISSUS LOW THE WIFE OF THE BARRISTER
3879-174923-0031 INTIMATING ALSO THAT MISTER LOW WOULD THEN HAVE FINISHED HIS AT NORTH BROUGHTON NOW MISTER LOW HAD SAT FOR NORTH BROUGHTON BEFORE PHINEAS LEFT LONDON AND HIS WIFE SPOKE OF THE SEAT AS A CERTAINTY
3879-174923-0032 PHINEAS COULD NOT KEEP HIMSELF FROM FEELING THAT MISSUS LOW INTENDED TO TRIUMPH OVER HIM BUT NEVERTHELESS HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION THEY WERE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM EXPLAINING THAT
3879-174923-0034 BUT THE GROUND FOR THAT WAS GONE AND MISSUS LOW WAS NO LONGER PAINFULLY SEVERE A FEW WORDS WERE SAID AS TO HIS GREAT LOSS MISSUS LOW ONCE RAISED HER EYEBROWS IN PRETENDED SURPRISE
3879-174923-0035 WHEN PHINEAS EXPLAINED THAT HE HAD THROWN UP HIS PLACE AND THEN THEY SETTLED DOWN ON THE QUESTION OF THE DAY AND SO SAID MISSUS LOW YOU'VE BEGUN TO ATTACK THE CHURCH IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT AT THIS MOMENT MISTER DAUBENY
3879-174923-0037 WOULD BE VERY MUCH DISTURBED INDEED SHOULD HE EVER BE TOLD THAT HE WAS REQUIRED AS AN EXPECTANT MEMBER OF MISTER DAUBENY'S PARTY TO VOTE FOR THE DISESTABLISHMENT
3879-174923-0038 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT I AM GUILTY OF THROWING THE FIRST STONE SAID PHINEAS THEY HAVE BEEN THROWING STONES AT THE TEMPLE SINCE FIRST IT WAS BUILT SAID MISSUS LOW WITH ENERGY BUT THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF ITS POLISHED SHAFTS IN DUST AND FRAGMENTS
3879-174923-0040 YOU HAVEN'T THROWN THE FIRST STONE SAID MISTER LOW BUT YOU HAVE TAKEN UP THE THROWING AT THE FIRST MOMENT IN WHICH STONES MAY BE DANGEROUS NO STONES CAN BE DANGEROUS SAID MISSUS LOW
3879-174923-0041 THE IDEA OF A STATE CHURCH SAID PHINEAS IS OPPOSED TO MY THEORY OF POLITICAL PROGRESS WHAT I HOPE IS THAT MY FRIENDS WILL NOT SUPPOSE THAT I ATTACK THE PROTESTANT CHURCH BECAUSE I AM A ROMAN CATHOLIC IF I WERE A PRIEST
3879-174923-0043 FOR A MOMENT ABSTAIN FROM ATTACKING THEIR GUEST IN RESPECT TO HIS SPEECHES AT TANKERVILLE IT SEEMED INDEED TO PHINEAS THAT AS MISSUS LOW WAS BUCKLED UP IN SUCH TRIPLE ARMOUR THAT SHE FEARED NOTHING
3879-174923-0044 SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN LESS LOUD IN EXPRESSING HER ABHORRENCE OF THE ENEMIES OF THE CHURCH IF SHE FEARED NOTHING WHY SHOULD SHE SCREAM SO LOUDLY BETWEEN THE TWO HE WAS A GOOD DEAL CRUSHED AND CONFOUNDED
3879-174923-0046 POOR MISSUS LOW WE CAN FORESEE THAT THERE IS MUCH GRIEF IN STORE FOR HER AND SOME ROCKS AHEAD TOO IN THE POLITICAL CAREER OF HER HUSBAND PHINEAS WAS STILL IN LONDON HANGING ABOUT THE CLUBS DOING NOTHING
3879-174923-0047 DISCUSSING MISTER DAUBENY'S WONDERFUL TREACHERY WITH SUCH MEN AS CAME UP TO TOWN AND WAITING FOR THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT WHEN HE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING LETTER FROM LADY LAURA KENNEDY DRESDEN NOVEMBER EIGHTEENTH
3879-174923-0049 THAN THAT YOU SHOULD BE LIVING IN DUBLIN I CANNOT CONCEIVE OF YOU AS LIVING ANY OTHER LIFE THAN THAT OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOWNING STREET AND THE CLUBS NOR DO I WISH TO DO SO
3879-174923-0050 AND WHEN I HEAR OF YOU AT HARRINGTON HALL I KNOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR WAY TO THE OTHER THINGS DO TELL ME WHAT LIFE IS LIKE WITH OSWALD AND VIOLET OF COURSE HE NEVER WRITES HE IS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO ON MARRYING
3879-174923-0052 AS THE WIFE OF A MASTER OF HOUNDS
3879-174923-0053 AS THE ART IS REAL SHE TOLD ME HOW POOR DEAR LADY BALDOCK COMMUNICATED TO YOU HER UNHAPPINESS ABOUT HER DAUGHTER IN A MANNER THAT MADE EVEN ME LAUGH AND WOULD MAKE THOUSANDS LAUGH IN DAYS TO COME WERE IT EVER TO BE PUBLISHED
3879-174923-0055 I AM SURE THEY ARE HAPPY TOGETHER BECAUSE VIOLET HAS MORE COMMON SENSE THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER KNEW AND PRAY TELL ME ABOUT THE AFFAIR AT TANKERVILLE MY COUSIN BARRINGTON WRITES ME WORD THAT YOU WILL CERTAINLY GET THE SEAT
3879-174923-0056 HE DECLARES THAT MISTER BROWBOROUGH IS ALMOST DISPOSED NOT TO FIGHT THE BATTLE THOUGH A MAN MORE DISPOSED TO FIGHT NEVER BRIBED AN ELECTOR BUT BARRINGTON SEEMS TO THINK THAT YOU MANAGED AS WELL AS YOU DID BY GETTING OUTSIDE THE TRACES AS HE CALLS IT
3879-174923-0058 BUT IF IT MUST COME WHY NOT BY YOUR HANDS AS WELL AS BY ANY OTHER IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE THAT YOU IN YOUR HEART SHOULD LOVE A PROTESTANT ASCENDANT CHURCH BUT AS BARRINGTON SAYS A HORSE WON'T GET OATS
3879-174923-0059 AT HOME AS YOU KNOW NOT ONLY DID HE TAKE AN ACTIVE PART IN POLITICS BUT HE WAS ACTIVE ALSO IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIS OWN PROPERTY NOW IT SEEMS TO HIM TO BE ALMOST TOO GREAT A TROUBLE TO WRITE A LETTER TO HIS STEWARD
3879-174923-0061 TO ME IT IS ALL ONE TRAGEDY I CANNOT BUT THINK OF THINGS AS THEY WERE TWO OR THREE YEARS SINCE MY FATHER AND MY HUSBAND WERE BOTH IN THE CABINET AND YOU YOUNG AS YOU WERE STOOD BUT ONE STEP BELOW IT OSWALD WAS OUT IN THE COLD HE WAS VERY POOR
3879-174923-0062 PAPA THOUGHT ALL EVIL OF HIM VIOLET HAD REFUSED HIM OVER AND OVER AGAIN HE QUARRELLED WITH YOU AND ALL THE WORLD SEEMED AGAINST HIM THEN OF A SUDDEN YOU VANISHED AND WE VANISHED AN INEFFABLE MISERY FELL UPON ME AND UPON MY WRETCHED HUSBAND
3879-174923-0064 HE WON HIS WIFE HONESTLY DID HE NOT AND HE HAS EVER BEEN HONEST IT IS MY PRIDE TO THINK I NEVER GAVE HIM UP BUT THE BITTER PART OF MY CUP CONSISTS IN THIS THAT AS HE HAS WON WHAT HE HAS DESERVED SO HAVE WE
3879-174923-0065 I COMPLAIN OF NO INJUSTICE OUR CASTLE WAS BUILT UPON THE SAND WHY SHOULD MISTER KENNEDY HAVE BEEN A CABINET MINISTER AND WHY SHOULD I HAVE BEEN HIS WIFE
3879-174923-0067 BY THE GLOOM OF HIS LIFE I SUPPOSE THAT HE LIVES EXCLUSIVELY AT LOUGHLINTER FROM TIME TO TIME I AM IMPLORED BY HIM TO RETURN TO MY DUTY BENEATH HIS ROOF HE GROUNDS HIS DEMAND ON NO AFFECTION OF HIS OWN
3879-174923-0068 ON NO PRESUMPTION THAT ANY AFFECTION CAN REMAIN WITH ME HE SAYS NO WORD OF HAPPINESS HE OFFERS NO COMFORT HE DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO PERSUADE WITH PROMISES OF FUTURE CARE HE MAKES HIS CLAIM SIMPLY ON HOLY WRIT AND ON THE FEELING OF DUTY WHICH
3879-174923-0070 I HAVE TOLD PAPA THAT I SHOULD ASK YOU AND HE WOULD BE DELIGHTED
3879-174923-0071 TO BE ABLE TO TALK AGAIN TO ONE WHO KNOWS ALL THE ERRORS AND ALL THE EFFORTS OF MY PAST LIFE AS YOU DO DRESDEN IS VERY COLD IN THE WINTER I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER YOU WOULD MIND THAT WE ARE VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT THE ROOMS BUT MY FATHER BEARS THE TEMPERATURE WONDERFULLY WELL
3947-13260-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN NO ONE IN ALL RAYMOND INCLUDING THE RECTANGLE FELT LOREEN'S DEATH MORE KEENLY THAN VIRGINIA IT CAME LIKE A DISTINCT PERSONAL LOSS TO HER
3947-13260-0001 THAT SHORT WEEK WHILE THE GIRL HAD BEEN IN HER HOME HAD OPENED VIRGINIA'S HEART TO A NEW LIFE SHE WAS TALKING IT OVER WITH RACHEL THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL
3947-13260-0003 I HAVE TALKED IT OVER WITH ROLLIN HE WILL DEVOTE A LARGE PART OF HIS MONEY ALSO TO THE SAME PLAN HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU VIRGINIA TO GIVE IN THIS WAY ASKED RACHEL ONCE SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE ASKED SUCH A PERSONAL QUESTION
3947-13260-0004 NOW IT SEEMED AS NATURAL TO TALK FRANKLY ABOUT MONEY AS ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE THAT BELONGED TO GOD I HAVE AVAILABLE FOR USE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ROLLIN HAS AS MUCH MORE
3947-13260-0006 WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION HONESTLY AND WISELY THE MONEY I SHALL PUT INTO THE NEWS IS I AM CONFIDENT IN A LINE WITH HIS PROBABLE ACTION
3947-13260-0007 IT IS AS NECESSARY THAT WE HAVE A CHRISTIAN DAILY PAPER IN RAYMOND ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE THE SALOON INFLUENCE TO MEET AS IT IS TO HAVE A CHURCH OR A COLLEGE SO I AM SATISFIED THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT MISTER NORMAN WILL KNOW HOW TO USE SO WELL
3947-13260-0009 THE FIELD WHERE THE TENT NOW IS HAS BEEN IN LITIGATION FOR YEARS WE MEAN TO SECURE THE ENTIRE TRACT AS SOON AS THE COURTS HAVE SETTLED THE TITLE FOR SOME TIME I HAVE BEEN MAKING A SPECIAL STUDY OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS AND RESIDENCE METHODS
3947-13260-0010 OF CHRISTIAN WORK AND INSTITUTIONAL CHURCH WORK IN THE HEART OF GREAT CITY SLUMS I DO NOT KNOW THAT I HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO TELL JUST WHAT IS THE WISEST AND MOST EFFECTIVE KIND OF WORK THAT CAN BE DONE IN RAYMOND BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH
3947-13260-0012 AND I DO NOT WANT TO BE SIMPLY A DISPENSER OF THIS MONEY GOD HELP ME I DO WANT TO PUT MYSELF INTO THE PROBLEM BUT YOU KNOW RACHEL I HAVE A FEELING ALL THE TIME THAT ALL THAT LIMITLESS MONEY AND LIMITLESS PERSONAL SACRIFICE CAN POSSIBLY DO
3947-13260-0013 WILL NOT REALLY LESSEN VERY MUCH THE AWFUL CONDITION AT THE RECTANGLE AS LONG AS THE SALOON IS LEGALLY ESTABLISHED THERE I THINK THAT IS TRUE OF ANY CHRISTIAN WORK NOW BEING CARRIED ON IN ANY GREAT CITY
3947-13260-0015 BUT VIRGINIA WHAT A WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF GOOD CAN BE DONE WITH THIS MONEY AND THE SALOON CANNOT ALWAYS REMAIN HERE THE TIME MUST COME WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FORCES IN THE CITY WILL TRIUMPH VIRGINIA PAUSED NEAR RACHEL AND HER PALE EARNEST FACE LIGHTED UP
3947-13260-0016 I BELIEVE THAT TOO THE NUMBER OF THOSE WHO HAVE PROMISED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD IS INCREASING IF WE ONCE HAVE SAY FIVE HUNDRED SUCH DISCIPLES IN RAYMOND THE SALOON IS DOOMED
3947-13260-0018 GIVE THEM THE BENEFIT OF YOUR TRAINING THERE ARE SOME SPLENDID VOICES IN THE ROUGH THERE DID ANY ONE EVER HEAR SUCH SINGING AS THAT YESTERDAY BY THOSE WOMEN RACHEL WHAT A BEAUTIFUL OPPORTUNITY
3947-13260-0019 YOU SHALL HAVE THE BEST OF MATERIAL IN THE WAY OF ORGANS AND ORCHESTRAS THAT MONEY CAN PROVIDE AND WHAT CANNOT BE DONE WITH MUSIC TO WIN SOULS THERE INTO HIGHER AND PURER AND BETTER LIVING
3947-13260-0021 IT WAS WHAT SHE HAD DREAMED OF DOING HERSELF IT REPRESENTED TO HER SOMETHING THAT SHE FELT WAS IN KEEPING WITH A RIGHT USE OF HER TALENT YES SHE SAID AS SHE ROSE AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0022 WHILE BOTH GIRLS IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THEIR ENTHUSIASM PACED THE HALL YES I WILL GLADLY PUT MY LIFE INTO THAT KIND OF SERVICE I DO BELIEVE THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE ME USE MY LIFE IN THIS WAY VIRGINIA WHAT MIRACLES CAN WE NOT ACCOMPLISH IN HUMANITY
3947-13260-0024 ROLLIN CAME BACK AND SAT DOWN AND TOGETHER THE THREE DISCUSSED THEIR FUTURE PLANS ROLLIN WAS APPARENTLY ENTIRELY FREE FROM EMBARRASSMENT IN RACHEL'S PRESENCE WHILE VIRGINIA WAS WITH THEM ONLY HIS MANNER WITH HER WAS ALMOST PRECISE IF NOT COLD
3947-13260-0025 THE PAST SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ABSORBED IN HIS WONDERFUL CONVERSION HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN IT BUT HE SEEMED TO BE COMPLETELY CAUGHT UP FOR THIS PRESENT TIME IN THE PURPOSE OF HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13260-0027 I SUPPOSE HE IS WRITING ANOTHER BOOK IS HE GOING TO PUT YOU INTO THIS ONE RACHEL YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SUSPECTED JASPER CHASE OF DOING THAT VERY THING IN HIS FIRST STORY VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0028 RACHEL SPOKE WITH THE FRANKNESS THAT HAD ALWAYS EXISTED BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS JASPER CHASE TOLD ME THE OTHER NIGHT THAT HE IN FACT HE PROPOSED TO ME OR HE WOULD IF
3947-13260-0030 I TOLD HIM NO I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM SINCE THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRST CONVERSIONS AT THE RECTANGLE I AM GLAD FOR YOU SAID VIRGINIA QUIETLY WHY ASKED RACHEL A LITTLE STARTLED
3947-13260-0031 BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER REALLY LIKED JASPER CHASE HE IS TOO COLD AND I DO NOT LIKE TO JUDGE HIM BUT I HAVE ALWAYS DISTRUSTED HIS SINCERITY IN TAKING THE PLEDGE AT THE CHURCH WITH THE REST
3947-13260-0033 I THINK PERHAPS IF HE HAD SPOKEN TO ME AT ANY OTHER TIME THAN THE ONE HE CHOSE I COULD EASILY HAVE PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I LOVED HIM BUT NOT NOW AGAIN RACHEL PAUSED SUDDENLY AND WHEN SHE LOOKED UP AT VIRGINIA AGAIN THERE WERE TEARS ON HER FACE
3947-13260-0034 VIRGINIA CAME TO HER AND PUT HER ARM ABOUT HER TENDERLY WHEN RACHEL HAD LEFT THE HOUSE VIRGINIA SAT IN THE HALL THINKING OVER THE CONFIDENCE HER FRIEND HAD JUST SHOWN HER THERE WAS SOMETHING STILL TO BE TOLD VIRGINIA FELT SURE FROM RACHEL'S MANNER
3947-13260-0036 IT WAS EASY FOR THEIR TALK TO SETTLE FINALLY UPON RACHEL BECAUSE OF THE PLACE SHE WAS TO OCCUPY IN THE PLANS WHICH WERE BEING MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AT THE RECTANGLE
3947-13260-0037 DID YOU EVER KNOW OF A GIRL OF SUCH REALLY GIFTED POWERS IN VOCAL MUSIC WHO WAS WILLING TO GIVE HER LIFE TO THE PEOPLE AS RACHEL IS GOING TO DO SHE IS GOING TO GIVE MUSIC LESSONS IN THE CITY HAVE PRIVATE PUPILS TO MAKE HER LIVING
3947-13260-0039 BUT DON'T YOU THINK IT IS A VERY UNUSUAL EXAMPLE CAN YOU IMAGINE HERE VIRGINIA NAMED HALF A DOZEN FAMOUS OPERA SINGERS DOING ANYTHING OF THIS SORT NO I CANNOT ROLLIN ANSWERED BRIEFLY
3947-13260-0040 NEITHER CAN I IMAGINE MISS HE SPOKE THE NAME OF THE GIRL WITH THE RED PARASOL WHO HAD BEGGED VIRGINIA TO TAKE THE GIRLS TO THE RECTANGLE DOING WHAT YOU ARE DOING VIRGINIA ANY MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE MISTER
3947-13260-0042 ROLLIN WHY DO YOU TREAT HER WITH SUCH A DISTINCT PRECISE MANNER I THINK ROLLIN PARDON ME IF I HURT YOU THAT SHE IS ANNOYED BY IT YOU NEED TO BE ON EASY TERMS I DON'T THINK RACHEL LIKES THIS CHANGE
3947-13260-0043 ROLLIN SUDDENLY STOPPED HE SEEMED DEEPLY AGITATED HE TOOK HIS ARM FROM VIRGINIA'S AND WALKED ALONE TO THE END OF THE HALL THEN HE RETURNED WITH HIS HANDS BEHIND HIM AND STOPPED NEAR HIS SISTER AND SAID
3947-13260-0045 THAT DAY SHE WAS HERE WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT HER REFUSAL TO JOIN THE CONCERT COMPANY I ASKED HER TO BE MY WIFE OUT THERE ON THE AVENUE SHE REFUSED ME AS I KNEW SHE WOULD AND SHE GAVE AS HER REASON THE FACT THAT I HAD NO PURPOSE IN LIFE WHICH WAS TRUE ENOUGH
3947-13260-0046 NOW THAT I HAVE A PURPOSE NOW THAT I AM A NEW MAN DON'T YOU SEE VIRGINIA HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING I OWE MY VERY CONVERSION TO RACHEL'S SINGING
3947-13260-0048 ROLLIN WAS SILENT THEN HE WENT ON WITH MORE EMOTION I STILL LOVE HER VIRGINIA
3947-13260-0049 HE STOPPED AND LOOKED HIS SISTER IN THE FACE WITH A SAD SMILE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT SAID VIRGINIA TO HERSELF SHE WAS NOTING ROLLIN'S HANDSOME FACE HIS MARKS OF DISSIPATION NEARLY ALL GONE NOW
3947-13262-0000 HE HAD COME SUDDENLY UPON HER AS HE TURNED INTO THE AVENUE AND HIS HEART HAD LEAPED UP AT THE SIGHT OF HER HE WALKED ALONG BY HER NOW REJOICING AFTER ALL IN A LITTLE MOMENT OF THIS EARTHLY LOVE HE COULD NOT DRIVE OUT OF HIS LIFE I HAVE JUST BEEN OVER TO SEE VIRGINIA
3947-13262-0001 SAID RACHEL SHE TELLS ME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NEARLY COMPLETED FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE RECTANGLE PROPERTY YES IT HAS BEEN A TEDIOUS CASE IN THE COURTS DID VIRGINIA SHOW YOU ALL THE PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS FOR BUILDING
3947-13262-0003 THAN A GOOD MANY PROFESSIONAL SLUM WORKERS SHE HAS BEEN SPENDING NEARLY ALL SUMMER IN GETTING INFORMATION ROLLIN WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MORE AT EASE AS THEY TALKED OVER THIS COMING WORK OF HUMANITY IT WAS SAFE COMMON GROUND
3947-13262-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING ALL SUMMER I HAVE NOT SEEN MUCH OF YOU RACHEL SUDDENLY ASKED AND THEN HER FACE WARMED WITH ITS QUICK FLUSH OF TROPICAL COLOR AS IF SHE MIGHT HAVE IMPLIED TOO MUCH INTEREST IN ROLLIN OR TOO MUCH REGRET AT NOT SEEING HIM OFTENER
3947-13262-0006 SHE PUT THE QUESTION VERY FRANKLY TURNING TOWARD ROLLIN IN REAL EARNEST YES CERTAINLY HE REPLIED WITH A GRACEFUL SMILE I AM NOT SO CERTAIN THAT I CAN TELL YOU MUCH
3947-13262-0007 I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOME WAY TO REACH THE MEN I ONCE KNEW AND WIN THEM INTO MORE USEFUL LIVES HE STOPPED SUDDENLY AS IF HE WERE ALMOST AFRAID TO GO ON RACHEL DID NOT VENTURE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING
3947-13262-0009 AND IT IS IN TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING MY WORK THAT IS WHAT I DO NOT UNDERSTAND VIRGINIA TOLD ME ABOUT THE OTHER IT SEEMS WONDERFUL TO THINK THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO KEEP THAT PLEDGE WITH US BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH THE CLUB MEN
3947-13262-0010 YOU HAVE ASKED ME A DIRECT QUESTION AND I SHALL HAVE TO ANSWER IT NOW REPLIED ROLLIN SMILING AGAIN YOU SEE I ASKED MYSELF AFTER THAT NIGHT AT THE TENT YOU REMEMBER HE SPOKE HURRIEDLY AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED A LITTLE
3947-13262-0012 DID YOU EVER THINK THAT OF ALL THE NEGLECTED BEINGS IN OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM NONE ARE QUITE SO COMPLETELY LEFT ALONE AS THE FAST YOUNG MEN WHO FILL THE CLUBS AND WASTE THEIR TIME AND MONEY AS I USED TO
3947-13262-0013 THE CHURCHES LOOK AFTER THE POOR MISERABLE CREATURES LIKE THOSE IN THE RECTANGLE THEY MAKE SOME EFFORT TO REACH THE WORKING MAN THEY HAVE A LARGE CONSTITUENCY AMONG THE AVERAGE SALARY EARNING PEOPLE THEY SEND MONEY AND MISSIONARIES TO THE FOREIGN HEATHEN
3947-13262-0015 I AM NOT FITTED TO REACH THE RECTANGLE PEOPLE I DO NOT KNOW HOW BUT I THINK I COULD POSSIBLY REACH SOME OF THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS WHO HAVE MONEY AND TIME TO SPEND SO THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO DO
3947-13262-0016 WHEN I ASKED AS YOU DID WHAT WOULD JESUS DO THAT WAS MY ANSWER
3947-13262-0018 HER INTEREST IN HIS PLAN WAS LARGER THAN MERE CURIOSITY ROLLIN PAGE WAS SO DIFFERENT NOW FROM THE FASHIONABLE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ASKED HER TO BE HIS WIFE THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP THINKING OF HIM AND TALKING WITH HIM AS IF HE WERE AN ENTIRELY NEW ACQUAINTANCE
3947-13262-0019 THEY HAD TURNED OFF THE AVENUE AND WERE GOING UP THE STREET TO RACHEL'S HOME IT WAS THE SAME STREET WHERE ROLLIN HAD ASKED RACHEL WHY SHE COULD NOT LOVE HIM THEY WERE BOTH STRICKEN WITH A SUDDEN SHYNESS AS THEY WENT ON
3947-13262-0021 IN YOUR WORK WITH THE CLUB MEN WITH YOUR OLD ACQUAINTANCES WHAT SORT OF RECEPTION DO THEY GIVE YOU HOW DO YOU APPROACH THEM WHAT DO THEY SAY ROLLIN WAS RELIEVED WHEN RACHEL SPOKE HE ANSWERED QUICKLY OH IT DEPENDS ON THE MAN
3947-13262-0022 A GOOD MANY OF THEM THINK I AM A CRANK I HAVE KEPT MY MEMBERSHIP UP AND AM IN GOOD STANDING IN THAT WAY I TRY TO BE WISE AND NOT PROVOKE ANY UNNECESSARY CRITICISM BUT YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED TO KNOW HOW MANY OF THE MEN HAVE RESPONDED TO MY APPEAL
3947-13262-0024 WHAT WOULD JESUS DO I KEEP ASKING IT THE ANSWER COMES SLOWLY FOR I AM FEELING MY WAY SLOWLY ONE THING I HAVE FOUND OUT THE MEN ARE NOT FIGHTING SHY OF ME I THINK THAT IS A GOOD SIGN
3947-13262-0025 ANOTHER THING I HAVE ACTUALLY INTERESTED SOME OF THEM IN THE RECTANGLE WORK AND WHEN IT IS STARTED UP THEY WILL GIVE SOMETHING TO HELP MAKE IT MORE POWERFUL AND IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REST I HAVE FOUND A WAY TO SAVE SEVERAL OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS FROM GOING TO THE BAD IN GAMBLING
3947-13262-0027 WITH IT ALL SHE KNEW THERE WAS A DEEP UNDERLYING SERIOUSNESS WHICH FELT THE BURDEN OF THE CROSS EVEN WHILE CARRYING IT WITH JOY THE NEXT TIME SHE SPOKE IT WAS WITH A SWIFT FEELING OF JUSTICE DUE TO ROLLIN AND HIS NEW LIFE
3947-13262-0028 DO YOU REMEMBER I REPROACHED YOU ONCE FOR NOT HAVING ANY PURPOSE WORTH LIVING FOR SHE ASKED WHILE HER BEAUTIFUL FACE SEEMED TO ROLLIN MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER WHEN HE HAD WON SUFFICIENT SELF CONTROL TO LOOK UP I WANT TO SAY
3947-13262-0030 RACHEL COULD NOT HELP SEEING IT THEY WALKED ALONG IN SILENCE AT LAST ROLLIN SAID I THANK YOU IT HAS BEEN WORTH MORE TO ME THAN I CAN TELL YOU TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT HE LOOKED INTO HER FACE FOR ONE MOMENT
3947-13262-0031 SHE READ HIS LOVE FOR HER IN THAT LOOK BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK WHEN THEY SEPARATED RACHEL WENT INTO THE HOUSE AND SITTING DOWN IN HER ROOM SHE PUT HER FACE IN HER HANDS AND SAID TO HERSELF
3947-13262-0033 NEVERTHELESS IT WAS EVIDENT TO HERSELF THAT HER EMOTION WAS NOT THAT OF REGRET OR SORROW SOMEHOW A GLAD NEW JOY HAD COME TO HER
3947-13262-0034 IT WAS INDEED A PART OF IT FOR IF SHE WAS BEGINNING TO LOVE ROLLIN PAGE IT WAS THE CHRISTIAN MAN SHE HAD BEGUN TO LOVE THE OTHER NEVER WOULD HAVE MOVED HER TO THIS GREAT CHANGE
3947-13262-0036 IN THAT HOPE HE WENT ON WITH HIS WORK AS THE DAYS SPED ON AND AT NO TIME WAS HE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING AND SAVING HIS OLD ACQUAINTANCES THAN IN THE TIME THAT FOLLOWED THAT CHANCE MEETING WITH RACHEL WINSLOW
3947-13262-0037 THE SUMMER HAD GONE AND RAYMOND WAS ONCE MORE FACING THE RIGOR OF HER WINTER SEASON VIRGINIA HAD BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A PART OF HER PLAN FOR CAPTURING THE RECTANGLE AS SHE CALLED IT
3947-13262-0039 BUT A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE HANDS OF A PERSON WHO TRULY WANTS TO DO WITH IT AS JESUS WOULD
3947-13262-0040 OUGHT TO ACCOMPLISH WONDERS FOR HUMANITY IN A SHORT TIME AND HENRY MAXWELL GOING OVER TO THE SCENE OF THE NEW WORK ONE DAY AFTER A NOON HOUR WITH THE SHOP MEN WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH HAD BEEN DONE OUTWARDLY
3947-13262-0042 EVEN COUNTING VIRGINIA'S AND RACHEL'S WORK AND MISTER GRAY'S WHERE HAD IT ACTUALLY COUNTED IN ANY VISIBLE QUANTITY
3947-13262-0043 OF COURSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF THE REDEMPTIVE WORK BEGUN AND CARRIED ON BY THE HOLY SPIRIT IN HIS WONDERFUL DISPLAYS OF POWER IN THE FIRST CHURCH AND IN THE TENT MEETINGS HAD HAD ITS EFFECT UPON THE LIFE OF RAYMOND
3947-13262-0045 HE SICKENED AT THE SIGHT HE FOUND HIMSELF ASKING HOW MUCH CLEANSING COULD A MILLION DOLLARS POURED INTO THIS CESSPOOL ACCOMPLISH
3947-13262-0046 WAS NOT THE LIVING SOURCE OF NEARLY ALL THE HUMAN MISERY THEY SOUGHT TO RELIEVE UNTOUCHED AS LONG AS THE SALOONS DID THEIR DEADLY BUT LEGITIMATE WORK
3947-13262-0048 IT WAS THE SAME THAT VIRGINIA HAD PUT TO RACHEL IN HER STATEMENT THAT IN HER OPINION NOTHING REALLY PERMANENT WOULD EVER BE DONE UNTIL THE SALOON WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE RECTANGLE
3947-13262-0049 HENRY MAXWELL WENT BACK TO HIS PARISH WORK THAT AFTERNOON WITH ADDED CONVICTIONS ON THE LICENSE BUSINESS BUT IF THE SALOON WAS A FACTOR IN THE PROBLEM OF THE LIFE OF RAYMOND NO LESS WAS THE FIRST CHURCH AND ITS LITTLE COMPANY OF DISCIPLES WHO HAD PLEDGED TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO
3947-13262-0051 THE WINTER WAS GONE AND THE YEAR WAS ENDED THE YEAR WHICH HENRY MAXWELL HAD FIXED AS THE TIME DURING WHICH THE PLEDGE SHOULD BE KEPT TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO SUNDAY THE ANNIVERSARY OF THAT ONE A YEAR AGO WAS IN MANY WAYS THE MOST REMARKABLE DAY THAT THE FIRST CHURCH EVER KNEW
3982-178459-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY NINE AS BIBBS CAME OUT OF THE NEW HOUSE A SUNDAY TRIO WAS IN COURSE OF PASSAGE UPON THE SIDEWALK AN AMPLE YOUNG WOMAN PLACID OF FACE A BLACK CLAD

3982-178459-0006 MARY HAPPENING TO GLANCE FROM A WINDOW SAW BIBBS COMING AND SHE STARTED CLASPING HER HANDS TOGETHER IN A SUDDEN ALARM
3982-178459-0008 SHE PAUSED AND HE CAME IN NOT LIFTING HIS EYES TO HERS ALWAYS WHEN HE CROSSED THAT THRESHOLD HE HAD COME WITH HIS HEAD UP AND HIS WISTFUL GAZE SEEKING HERS

3982-182255-0001 AS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF THIS CITY SAID MISTER NEWBERRY LEANING BACK IN A LEATHER ARMCHAIR AT THE MAUSOLEUM CLUB AND LIGHTING A SECOND CIGAR IT'S ROTTEN THAT'S ALL
3982-182255-0002 ABSOLUTELY ROTTEN ASSENTED MISTER DICK OVEREND RINGING THE BELL FOR A SECOND WHISKEY AND SODA CORRUPT SAID MISTER NEWBERRY BETWEEN TWO PUFFS OF HIS CIGAR FULL OF GRAFT SAID MISTER OVEREND
3982-182255-0004 AND THEN LEANING FORWARDS IN HIS CHAIR AND LOOKING CAREFULLY ABOUT THE CORRIDORS OF THE CLUB HE SPOKE BEHIND HIS HAND AND SAID AND THE MAYOR'S THE BIGGEST GRAFTER OF THE LOT AND WHAT'S MORE HE ADDED
3982-182255-0005 SINKING HIS VOICE TO A WHISPER THE TIME HAS COME TO SPEAK OUT ABOUT IT FEARLESSLY MISTER OVEREND NODDED IT'S A TYRANNY HE SAID WORSE THAN RUSSIA REJOINED MISTER NEWBERRY
3982-182255-0007 NOT ARGUMENTATIVELY OR WITH ANY HEAT BUT WITH THE REFLECTIVE SADNESS THAT STEALS OVER AN ELDERLY MAN WHEN HE SITS IN THE LEATHER ARMCHAIR OF A COMFORTABLE CLUB SMOKING A GOOD CIGAR AND MUSING ON THE DECADENCE OF THE PRESENT DAY
3982-182255-0008 THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIDN'T ANGER THEM IT MERELY GRIEVED THEM THEY COULD REMEMBER BOTH OF THEM HOW DIFFERENT EVERYTHING WAS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG MEN JUST ENTERING ON LIFE
3982-182255-0010 HERE THEIR VOICES WERE ALMOST HUSHED IN AWE WHY WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG THE UNITED STATES SENATE BUT NO NEITHER OF THEM COULD FIND A PHRASE BIG ENOUGH FOR THEIR MEANING THEY MERELY REPEATED
3982-182255-0011 AND THEN SHOOK THEIR HEADS AND TOOK LONG DRINKS OF WHISKEY AND SODA THEN NATURALLY SPEAKING OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD LED THEM TO TALK OF THE ROTTENNESS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE
3982-182255-0013 HE RECALLED HOW HE HAD BEEN TAKEN AS A BOY OF TWELVE BY HIS FATHER TO HEAR A DEBATE HE WOULD NEVER FORGET IT GIANTS HE SAID THAT WAS WHAT THEY WERE IN FACT THE THING WAS MORE LIKE A WITENAGEMOT
3982-182255-0014 THAN A LEGISLATURE HE SAID HE DISTINCTLY RECALLED A MAN WHOSE NAME HE DIDN'T RECOLLECT SPEAKING ON A QUESTION HE DIDN'T JUST REMEMBER WHAT EITHER FOR OR AGAINST
3982-182255-0016 AS FOR THE PRESENT LEGISLATURE WELL MISTER NEWBERRY HAD HAD HE SAID OCCASION TO VISIT THE STATE CAPITAL A WEEK BEFORE IN CONNECTION WITH A RAILWAY BILL THAT HE WAS TRYING TO THAT IS THAT HE WAS ANXIOUS TO
3982-182255-0017 FROM SPEAKING OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER DICK OVEREND WERE LED TO TALK OF THE CROOKEDNESS OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT AND THEY BOTH AGREED AS ABOVE THAT THINGS WERE WORSE THAN IN RUSSIA WHAT SECRETLY IRRITATED THEM BOTH MOST
3982-182255-0019 AS A GENERAL WAVE OF FEELING THAT WAS PASSING OVER THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE HAD COME A MOMENT QUITE SUDDENLY IT SEEMED WHEN IT OCCURRED TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE WHOLE GOVERNMENT OF THE CITY WAS ROTTEN THE WORD IS A STRONG ONE
3982-182255-0020 BUT IT IS THE ONE THAT WAS USED LOOK AT THE ALDERMEN THEY SAID ROTTEN LOOK AT THE CITY SOLICITOR ROTTEN AND AS FOR THE MAYOR HIMSELF PHEW THE THING CAME LIKE A WAVE
3982-182255-0022 WERE SIMPLY A BYWORD THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES FOR RANK CRIMINAL CORRUPTION THIS WAS SAID SO WIDELY THAT EVERYBODY STARTED HUNTING THROUGH THE DAILY PAPERS TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO IN BLAZES WERE ALDERMEN ANYHOW
3982-182255-0023 AND AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE MOMENT WHEN THIS WAVE OF FEELING STRUCK THE CITY NOBODY KNEW OR CARED WHO WERE ALDERMEN ANYWAY TO TELL THE TRUTH THE ALDERMEN HAD BEEN MUCH THE SAME PERSONS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS SOME WERE IN THE PRODUCE BUSINESS
3982-182255-0025 SOMETIMES ONE SAW A PICTURE IN THE PAPER AND WONDERED FOR A MOMENT WHO THE PERSON WAS BUT ON LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AND NOTICING WHAT WAS WRITTEN UNDER IT ONE SAID OH I SEE AN ALDERMAN AND TURNED TO SOMETHING ELSE WHOSE FUNERAL IS THAT
3982-182255-0026 A MAN WOULD SOMETIMES ASK ON PLUTORIA AVENUE OH JUST ONE OF THE CITY ALDERMEN
3982-182255-0028 HOW AND WHERE THIS MOVEMENT OF INDIGNATION HAD STARTED PEOPLE SAID THAT IT WAS PART OF A NEW WAVE OF PUBLIC MORALITY THAT WAS SWEEPING OVER THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES CERTAINLY IT WAS BEING REMARKED IN ALMOST EVERY SECTION OF THE COUNTRY
3982-182255-0029 CHICAGO NEWSPAPERS WERE ATTRIBUTING ITS ORIGIN TO THE NEW VIGOUR AND THE FRESH IDEALS OF THE MIDDLE WEST IN BOSTON IT WAS SAID TO BE DUE TO A REVIVAL OF THE GRAND OLD NEW ENGLAND SPIRIT IN PHILADELPHIA
3982-182255-0031 AS A PROTEST AGAINST THE SLUGGISHNESS AND IGNORANCE OF THE SOUTH IN THE WEST THEY SPOKE OF IT AS A REVOLT AGAINST THE SPIRIT OF THE EAST AND IN THE EAST THEY CALLED IT A REACTION AGAINST THE LAWLESSNESS OF THE WEST BUT EVERYWHERE THEY HAILED IT AS A NEW SIGN OF THE GLORIOUS
3982-182255-0032 UNITY OF THE COUNTRY IF THEREFORE MISTER NEWBERRY AND MISTER OVEREND WERE FOUND TO BE DISCUSSING THE CORRUPT STATE OF THEIR CITY THEY ONLY SHARED IN THE NATIONAL SENTIMENTS OF THE MOMENT IN FACT IN THE SAME CITY HUNDREDS OF OTHER CITIZENS

3983-5371-0030 YOU MAY WONDER THAT THE SUBMERGED GENTLEMAN SHOULD BE WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS WAY TO HIS QUARTERS THE RAVEN INN FOR HE HAD BEEN EJECTED FROM THE BUCK'S HEAD BUT HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF AS HE WAS DRIPPING AND SWEARING ON THE BRINK OF THE POND
3983-5371-0031 WONDERING HOW HE SHOULD GET TO THE RAVEN AN EMPTY FLY DROVE PAST AND MISTER DRAKE IMMEDIATELY STOPPED IT BUT WHEN THE DRIVER SAW THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO CONVEY NOT ONLY A PASSENGER BUT A TOLERABLE QUANTITY OF WATER AS WELL AND THAT THE PASSENGER MOREOVER WAS SIR FRANCIS LEVISON

3983-5371-0048 IT WAS MY DUTY TO DO SO THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE TO UNDERTAKE IT DID YOU ASCERTAIN POSITIVELY BEYOND ALL DOUBT THAT SHE DID DIE
3983-5371-0049 A PAUSE MISS CARLYLE WAS RUMINATING BUT SHE RETURNED TO THE CHARGE AS IF DIFFICULT TO BE CONVINCED YOU DEEM THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF AN ERROR YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE IS DEAD
3983-5371-0051 HAD ANY ERROR OCCURRED AT THAT TIME ANY FALSE REPORT OF HER DEATH I SHOULD SOON HAVE FOUND IT OUT BY HER DRAWING THE ANNUITY I SETTLED UPON HER IT HAS NEVER BEEN DRAWN SINCE BESIDES SHE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN TO ME AS AGREED UPON
3983-5371-0052 NO POOR THING SHE IS GONE BEYOND ALL DOUBT AND HAS TAKEN HER SINS WITH HER CONVINCING PROOFS AND MISS CARLYLE LENT HER EAR TO THEM THE FOLLOWING MORNING WHILE MADAME VINE WAS AT BREAKFAST MISTER CARLYLE ENTERED

3983-5371-0055 THE DRIVE I THINK WILL DO HIM GOOD REPLIED MISTER CARLYLE AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ACCOMPANY HIM IF YOU DO NOT MIND THE TROUBLE YOU CAN HAVE THE PONY CARRIAGE
3983-5371-0057 YES SIR HE CROSSED THE HALL ON HIS ENTRANCE TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM SHE TORE UPSTAIRS TO HER CHAMBER AND SANK DOWN IN AN AGONY OF TEARS AND DESPAIR OH TO LOVE HIM AS SHE DID NOW TO YEARN AFTER HIS AFFECTION WITH THIS PASSIONATE JEALOUS LONGING
3983-5371-0058 AND TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOR EVER AND EVER THAT SHE WAS WORSE TO HIM THAN NOTHING
4014-186175-0001 THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF GOING ANY LENGTHS IF NECESSARY ALREADY HAD BEEN PROVED AND THE EVIDENCE OF HIS EVIL GENIUS MIGHT COME IN HORRIBLE FORM AT ANY INSTANT NEVERTHELESS
4014-186175-0002 WAS SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT JERRY AND SLIM FROM TAKING A FULL EIGHT HOURS OF MUCH NEEDED SLEEP WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON JOE AND THREE OTHER OFFICERS WHOM THE CAPTAIN HAD TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE MATTER FOLLOWED OUT EVERY POSSIBLE CLUE IN PURSUIT OF A SOLUTION OF THE BAFFLING MYSTERY
4014-186175-0004 REFRESHED BY THEIR SLEEP JERRY AND SLIM AROSE ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON JOE WHO HAD RESTED EASILY THROUGHOUT THE LATER EXCITEMENT OF THE PRECEDING NIGHT WAS STILL IN THE MIDST OF THE INVESTIGATION AND WAS NOT THEN TO BE FOUND
4014-186175-0005 JERRY HAD SOME LETTERS TO WRITE SO SLIM WENT TO THE UPPER DECK ALONE
4014-186175-0007 LIKE THE AWAKENING CALL THAT COMES TO A MAN IN A SOUND SLEEP
4014-186175-0008 TO FIND SOMEONE STANDING DIRECTLY OVER HIM LOUDLY AND INSISTENTLY CALLING HIS NAME
4014-186175-0010 WAS RAPPING DESPERATELY UPON THAT PIPE AND IN THE LONG AND SHORT DASHES OF THE INTERNATIONAL CODE THAT SOMEONE WAS REPEATING A SINGLE WORD HELP HELP HELP IN ANOTHER INSTANT USING THE HEAVY END OF HIS JACKKNIFE AS A CRUDE TRANSMITTER SLIM WAS TAPPING OFF THE REPLY
4014-186175-0011 WHO ARE YOU AND WHERE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THE MESSAGE BEGAN TO COME BACK
4014-186175-0013 WELL THE CAPTAIN DEMANDED STERNLY WHY ALL THE HASTE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SLIM BLURTED OUT HE'S LOCKED IN A CLOSET DOWN NEAR THE ENGINE ROOM LOCKED IN A CLOSET THE CAPTAIN REPEATED INCREDULOUSLY HOW DO YOU KNOW
4014-186175-0014 HE GAVE A TELEGRAPHIC CALL FOR HELP ON THE STEAM PIPE WHICH RUNS THROUGH THERE AND CONNECTS WITH THE WHISTLE THE LAD EXPLAINED I WAS ON DECK AND HEARD IT I TALKED WITH HIM OVER THE PIPE THERE IS NO TIME TO LOSE THEN COME WITH ME AND THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF HURRIEDLY LED THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186175-0016 THEY STOOD SILENT A MOMENT AND THEN FAINT AND INDISTINCT APPARENTLY FROM SOMEWHERE SEVERAL FEET AHEAD OF THEM THEY BOTH HEARD REPEATED THAT WHICH HAD MADE SLIM STOP
4014-186175-0017 THE LAD REPEATED THEM FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186175-0019 AND HE STARTED DOWN THE PASSAGEWAY TOWARD A NARROW STAIRS LEADING TO A STILL LOWER CHAMBER IN THE VESSEL THREE TURNS TWO TO THE RIGHT AND ONE TO THE LEFT AND THE CAPTAIN STOPPED AGAIN TO LISTEN SEEMINGLY FROM WITHIN THE WALL RIGHT AT THEIR ELBOWS THERE CAME A FEEBLE KNOCK
4014-186175-0020 THE OFFICER WHIPPED OUT A POCKET FLASHLIGHT THEY WERE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF A HEAVY WOODEN DOOR IT WAS LOCKED
4014-186175-0022 BUT THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM WITHIN
4014-186175-0023 TWO MORE ATTEMPTS AND THE PANEL FELL IN STRIPS TO THE FLOOR THUS GIVEN SOMETHING FOR A GRIP HOLD THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A MASSIVE MAN TOOK HOLD WITH BOTH HANDS
4014-186175-0025 THE UNCONSCIOUS FORM OF LIEUTENANT MACKINSON TUMBLED OUT UPON THE FLOOR HIS FACE WAS ALMOST BLUE FROM SUFFOCATION THE CAPTAIN SOUNDED THREE SHORT SHARP BLASTS UPON A WHISTLE WHICH HE HAD TAKEN FROM HIS POCKET AND TWO OILERS CAME RUNNING TO THE SPOT
4014-186175-0026 HELP US CARRY THIS MAN TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY HE ORDERED HE HAS BEEN OVERCOME
4014-186175-0028 FOUND HIM LOCKED IN A SMALL COMPARTMENT DOWN NEAR THE AUXILIARY ENGINE ROOM THE COMMANDER SAID BRIEFLY
4014-186175-0029 HE MADE HIS WHEREABOUTS KNOWN BY TAPPING A MESSAGE ON A STEAM PIPE
4014-186175-0031 HIS HEART ACTION IS PRETTY WEAK EVEN YET
4014-186175-0032 AT THAT MOMENT JERRY CAME HURRYING DOWN THE DECK HE WAS VISIBLY EXCITED BUT
4014-186175-0034 WHEN I RETURNED I FOUND THIS LYING UPON THE TABLE HE OPENED HIS LEFT HAND IN IT LAY A PIECE OF LIGHT CHAIN BOTH ENDS BROKEN BESIDE IT HE CONTINUED WAS THIS NOTE FROM HIS POCKET HE EXTRACTED A PIECE OF PAPER THE EDGES OF WHICH WERE ROUGHLY TORN
4014-186175-0035 LET THIS BE A WARNING THAT NO FURTHER INTERFERENCE WILL BE OF AVAIL THE CAPTAIN LOOKED FROM THE NOTE TO THE CHAIN
4014-186175-0037 THE SENIOR OFFICER OF THE VESSEL TOOK FROM HIS POCKET THE CROSS WITH ITS TWO BITS OF CHAIN STILL DANGLING FROM IT HE PLACED THE ENDS TO THE CHAIN WHICH JERRY HAD FOUND IN THE WIRELESS ROOM YOU ARE RIGHT HE SAID SIMPLY AND THERE COULD BE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT
4014-186175-0038 APPEARED EQUALLY ANXIOUS A MAN IS DISCOVERED AT NIGHT IN THE BATTERY ROOM OF THE WIRELESS DEPARTMENT OF THIS SHIP CLEARLY UPON AN UNFRIENDLY MISSION SAID THE CAPTAIN HALF TO HIMSELF AND HALF FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHERS SUMMING UP THE EVIDENCE THUS FAR KNOWN TO THEM
4014-186175-0040 IS SHOVED INTO A CLOSET AND ONLY ESCAPES DEATH FROM SUFFOCATION BY MAKING HIMSELF HEARD AS HE TELEGRAPHS FOR HELP OVER A STEAM PIPE IT MUST HAVE BEEN WHILE WE WERE RESCUING THE LIEUTENANT THAT THE SAME MAN AGAIN ENTERS THE WIRELESS ROOM AND LEAVES THERE THIS CHAIN
4014-186175-0041 WE ARE NOT SAFE WHILE HE IS FREE
4014-186176-0001 THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT IT SEEMED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING A TRAIL WHICH HE BELIEVED WAS LEADING HIM CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE OBJECT OF THE HUNT AND IT WAS IN FORGING THE LINKS OF THIS CHAIN OF CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT THE YOUNG OFFICER WAS LED INTO THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE SHIP
4014-186176-0002 PRESUMABLY FROM THE ENGINE OR BOILER ROOM THROW ASIDE SOMETHING AS HE HURRIED ALONG THE PASSAGEWAY LEADING FROM THE WIRELESS ROOM
4014-186176-0004 EVIDENTLY ALSO FROM THE BOILER OR ENGINE ROOM BRUSHED BY US HE HAD DISAPPEARED WHEN THE SAILOR SAID TO ME I THINK THAT WAS THE FELLOW THE ONE THAT JUST WENT BY NOT WANTING TO AROUSE HIS SUSPICIONS I ENDED THE CONVERSATION WITH A CASUAL REMARK AND THEN STROLLED AWAY UNTIL I WAS OUT OF THE SAILOR'S SIGHT
4014-186176-0005 I WAS GROPING MY WAY ALONG WHEN I THOUGHT I HEARD STEPS JUST AHEAD OF ME I STOPPED TO LISTEN AND WHEN THE SOUND WAS NOT REPEATED I PROCEEDED ONWARD
4014-186176-0007 EVERY MOMENT IT BECAME MORE STIFLING IN THERE AND I HAD NO DOUBT THAT I HAD WALKED DIRECTLY INTO A DEATH TRAP IT WAS THEN I BEGAN SIGNALING ON THE STEAM PIPE I GUESS IT WAS A MIGHTY LUCKY THING FOR ME THAT SLIM GOODWIN STROLLED OUT ON DECK JUST AT THE TIME HE DID
4014-186176-0008 AND THAT WAS ALL THAT LIEUTENANT MACKINSON COULD TELL THE MYSTERIOUS STRANGER REMAINED WHAT HE HAD BEEN FROM THE FIRST A DESPERATE AND DANGEROUS AND UNKNOWN SPY
4014-186176-0010 TO WHICH HE IS AN ENEMY AND A TRAITOR BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS THAT KNOCKOUT THAT HE HANDED TO JOE AND THE MIDNIGHT SCARE HE GAVE JERRY AND ME AND FINALLY HIS EFFORT TO KILL LIEUTENANT MACKINSON BY SLOW SUFFOCATION
4014-186176-0011 WELL SAID JOE I THINK I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT WILL WORK BUT
4014-186176-0013 ALONG WHAT LINES DO WE DISPERSE OUR FORCES GENERAL ASKED SLIM ALONG WHAT LINES WOULD HIS ROYAL STOUTNESS SUGGEST DEMANDED JERRY OH YOU DON'T HAVE TO KEEP REMINDING ME THAT I'M A TRIFLE HEAVY SLIM REPLIED IN A PEEVISH TONE
4014-186176-0014 A TRIFLE HEAVY GET THAT WILL YOU ECHOED JERRY WITH A GALE OF LAUGHTER A TRIFLE HEAVY OH MY YOU'LL FIND OUT IF I SIT ON YOU SLIM THREATENED IN A BELLIGERENT TONE
4014-186176-0016 AND TO DO THAT HE WILL HAVE TO USE THE WIRELESS SOMEHOW IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT HE WOULD MAKE HIS EFFORT AT NIGHT
4014-186176-0017 THE LIEUTENANT COULD BE IN THE WIRELESS ROOM AND ONE OF US IN THE BATTERY ROOM WHILE THE OTHER TWO DID DUTY OUTSIDE
4014-186176-0019 I'M WILLING SAID JERRY BUT YOU AND I WILL HAVE TO DO THE OUTSIDE WORK
4014-186176-0020 WELL I'LL COVER THE BATTERY ROOM SAID SLIM IGNORING JERRY'S REMARK LET'S SEE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON THEN SUGGESTED JOE AND THEY WENT TO FIND THE YOUNG OFFICER WHO WAS CONVALESCING FROM HIS ENCOUNTER WITH THE SPY WHEN HE HAD APPROVED THE PLAN THEY GOT THE O K OF THE CAPTAIN
4014-186176-0022 BLACK ENDLESS NIGHTS DAWN CAME
4014-186176-0023 THERE WERE MUTUAL FEELINGS OF DISAPPOINTMENT BUT NONE OF WEAKENED DETERMINATION WHAT LUCK
4014-186176-0025 THE SEA IS CALM AND WE READILY COULD DISCERN A PERISCOPE A LONG DISTANCE AWAY TRULY IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT AND IT WAS IN THIS ALLURING QUIET OF SEEMINGLY ABSOLUTE PEACE
4014-186176-0026 THE BRIGHTON BOYS AND THEIR FRIEND AND SUPERIOR OFFICER THE LIEUTENANT HAD BEEN IN THEIR APPOINTED PLACES HARDLY MORE THAN AN HOUR WHEN JOE AND JERRY AT THE SAME INSTANT CAUGHT THE SOUNDS OF SOME SORT OF SCUFFLE ON THE DECK ABOVE
4014-186176-0028 THE FIRST ASSISTANT ENGINEER WAS A MIGHTY MOUNTAIN OF A MAN BUT HIS VOICE BROKE OFF AS THE COMMOTION STARTED AGAIN CERTAINLY HE MUST HAVE A ROUGH CUSTOMER TO DEAL WITH THOUGHT JERRY
4014-186176-0029 YE WILL WILL YE HISSED THE VOICE OF THE ENGINEER AGAIN
4014-186176-0031 AND WHIN I ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS ABOUT
4014-186176-0032 SO SAID THE CAPTAIN IN A VOICE SO STERN IT MADE JOE WINCE
4014-186176-0034 YES AND I BELIEVE HE'S WORSE THAN THAT THE CAPTAIN ADDED
4014-186176-0035 THERE WAS A STRAINED SILENCE FOR A MOMENT THEN
4014-186176-0037 THERE WAS A GASP OF ASTONISHMENT FROM JOE FOLLOWED BY A LOUDER HOLY SMOKE FROM SLIM DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS MAN THE CAPTAIN ASKED IN A SHARP TONE I SHOULD SAY I DO SIR JOE RESPONDED
4014-186176-0038 HE IS THE MAN WHO WAS PLANTING AMMUNITION IN THE WATERS NEAR THE NAVY YARD THAT NIGHT BEFORE WE SAILED THE VERY SAME ONE SIR SLIM EXCLAIMED WITH EQUAL POSITIVENESS THE SHIP'S SURGEON WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE OTHERS UPON DECK STEPPED CLOSER FOR A BETTER INSPECTION OF THIS ENEMY
4014-186176-0040 AND THRUST THE ENGINEER FROM HIM BEFORE ANYONE COULD INTERFERE HE WAS DASHING DOWN THE DECK TOWARD THE STERN JUST AS HE TOOK A WILD HEADLONG LEAP OVER THE RAIL THE CAPTAIN FIRED WHILE THE CAPTAIN THROUGH A SPEAKING TUBE WAS INSTRUCTING THE MAN IN THE PILOT HOUSE TO SIGNAL BELOW REVERSE ENGINES
4014-186176-0041 THE OTHERS RUSHED TO THE STERN OF THE SHIP FAR BEHIND THEM IN THE FOAMY TRAIL LEFT ON THE MOONLIT WATER BY THE VESSEL THEY SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE THE HEAD OF A MAN BOBBING UP AND DOWN AND THEN IT ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED THE SHIP WAS TURNED
4014-186176-0043 AND MADE ME RUN A MILE IN NOTHING FLAT ADDED JERRY AND FOUGHT ME TO A KNOCKOUT FINISH LATER MUSED JOE AND NEARLY SMOTHERED ME TO DEATH SPOKE THE LIEUTENANT AND WAS FINALLY CORRALLED BY AN IRISH ENGINEER SAID SLIM GONE CONCLUDED JERRY
4014-186179-0000 THE FOLLOWING MORNING ALL OF THOSE WHO HAD ARRIVED ON THE TRANSPORTS WERE ESTABLISHED IN A CONCENTRATION CAMP BUT IT WAS MERELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPECTION OF MEN AND EQUIPMENT AND WAS NOT TO BE FOR LONG
4014-186179-0002 HIS THREE ASSISTANTS ON THE TRIP ACROSS WERE THE FIRST ONES NAMED THE OTHER TWO WERE TOM RAWLE A FELLOW PROPORTIONED LIKE THEIR FIRST FRIEND IN THE SERVICE SERGEANT MARTIN AND A WIRY ENERGETIC QUICK SPEAKING YOUTH NAMED FRANK HOSKINS

4014-186179-0012 ALL READY THEY ANSWERED AND THE LIEUTENANT LED THE WAY TO THE TRAIN

4014-186179-0015 AND RESTFUL SLUMBER SLUMBER THAT WAS TO FIT THEM FOR HARD AND DIFFICULT DUTIES AHEAD THIS IS WHERE WE GET OFF FINALLY ANNOUNCED LIEUTENANT MACKINSON SHAKING THE LADS INTO WAKEFULNESS

4014-186179-0024 WAS A CONSTANTLY MOVING LINE OF MOTOR TRUCKS COMING FORWARD WITH MEN AND SHELLS WHILE OUT AHEAD OF THEM TREMENDOUS AND MENACING BIG TANKS
4014-186179-0026 EQUIPPED WITH GUNS AND MEN THAT COULD TRAVEL WITH THEIR OWN POWER PRACTICALLY ANYWHERE ACROSS SHELL HOLES OVER TRENCHES THROUGH BARBED WIRE

4014-186179-0033 AS THEY ALL LEANED OVER HIS DESK TO FOLLOW THE TRACING OF HIS PENCIL WITH WHICH HE SHOWED THEM THE COURSE THEY WERE TO TAKE
4014-186179-0035 YOU SHOULD LEAVE HERE ABOUT SEVEN O'CLOCK THIS EVENING IT IS NOW SIX FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER THEY HAD EXAMINED THEIR ARMS AND EQUIPPED THEMSELVES WITH A FULL SUPPLY OF SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION PORTABLE WIRELESS INSTRUMENT AND ANTENNAE AND THREE RATIONS EACH OF EATING CHOCOLATE
4014-186179-0036 AND IF WOUNDED MIGHT OTHERWISE STARVE TO DEATH
4014-186179-0038 IT WAS A BLACK NIGHT AND THEY PROCEEDED WITH THE GREATEST CAUTION THEY DID NOT DARE USE THE FLASHLIGHTS THAT EACH OF THEM CARRIED AND FREQUENTLY ALL OF THEM WOULD HAVE TO DROP SUDDENLY FLAT UPON THE GROUND AS A BIG ROCKET WENT UP FROM EITHER SIDE
4014-186179-0039 IN THIS WAY THEY WENT FORWARD YARD BY YARD UNTIL THEY REACHED A THICK CLUMP OF TREES THERE AFTER LISTENING INTENTLY FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WITHOUT HEARING A DANGEROUS SOUND THEY SPREAD OUT THEIR COATS TENT LIKE WHILE LIEUTENANT MACKINSON WITH GINGERLY FLASHES OF HIS LIGHT
4014-186179-0041 WHILE TOM RAWLE QUIETLY CHUCKLING AT THE FAT LAD'S MISFORTUNE AIDED HIM TO HIS FEET DOWN FLAT SAID MACKINSON AGAIN AS HE DISCERNED SEVERAL SHADOWS MOVING ACROSS A SPACE A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO THE NORTH OF THEM
4014-186179-0042 FOR FULLY TEN MINUTES WHICH SEEMED LIKE AN HOUR THEY LAY THERE NOT DARING TO MOVE THEY WATCHED THE ENEMY SCOUTING PARTY GET A LIKE SCARE AND THEN AFTER WHAT SEEMED TO BE A WHISPERED CONSULTATION TURN BACK TO THE GERMAN LINES
4014-186179-0044 COPPER EXCLAIMED THE LIEUTENANT HOSKINS LET ME HAVE THAT KIT
4014-186179-0045 A VERY SMALL TELEGRAPH INSTRUMENT THE INSTANT IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE WIRE THE RECEIVER BEGAN TO TICK IRREGULARLY NEITHER RAWLE NOR HOSKINS UNDERSTOOD GERMAN BUT TO THE OTHERS THEY WERE WORDS EASY TO TRANSLATE THEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY STRUCK AN ENEMY WIRE AND HAD TAPPED IT
4014-186183-0000 FRANK HOSKINS ELBOW WOUND HEALED QUICKLY WITHOUT ANY SERIOUS RESULTS AND TOM RAWLE WHO HAD BEEN UNDER TREATMENT AT THE FIELD HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO GET ABOUT THE CAMP
4014-186183-0001 BUT ON THE EIGHTH DAY A VERITABLE FURY LAUNCHED ITSELF UPON THAT SECTION OF THE AMERICAN FRENCH FRONT IN THE SHAPE OF SEEMINGLY ENDLESS BRIGADES OF BOCHES THAT WERE HURLED OVER THE TOP OF THEIR OWN BREASTWORKS ACROSS NO MAN'S LAND AND UPON THE FIRST LINE TRENCHES OF THE ALLIES
4014-186183-0003 IT WAS A SURPRISE ATTACK IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD WITH ALL THE TERRIBLE CARNAGE THAT SUCH A BATTLE BRINGS
4014-186183-0004 AND THEIR HIDDEN ARTILLERY TO THE REAR OF THEM THIS WAS KEPT UP FOR ABOUT SEVEN HOURS AND THE DUEL OF HEAVY GUNS SHOOK THE EARTH LIKE A QUAKE AND WAS DEAFENING THEN JUST AS DAWN WAS BREAKING THE INFANTRY ONSLAUGHT
4014-186183-0006 EVERYTHING MOVED LIKE CLOCKWORK AND WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SPEED AND THROUGHOUT IT ALL MEN ON BOTH SIDES WERE SHOOTING SHOUTING SHRIEKING
4014-186183-0007 OR LIFELESS BEFORE SUPERIOR NUMBERS
4014-186183-0009 EVERY DETAIL OF THAT TREMENDOUS BATTLE JERRY KNEW HIS OWN OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OVER THE SIDE INFORMED HIM OF THE TEMPORARY REVERSES HIS OWN ARMY WAS SUFFERING WHILE THE REMARKS OF THE OFFICER TOLD HIM WHERE THE GERMANS WERE MEETING THEIR BITTEREST REPULSES
4014-186183-0010 WHERE THEY WERE DRAWING UP THEIR HEAVIEST FORCES OF RESERVES WHAT QUICK CHANGES WERE BEING MADE IN THEIR GENERAL LINE OF FORMATION AND HOW FAR BACK THEIR FORCES SEEMED TO EXTEND SLIM GOODWIN
4014-186183-0012 THE WAVERING SWAYING TARGET WAS WATCHED FROM TIME TO TIME AND SPECULATIONS MADE AS TO HOW LONG IT COULD REMAIN WITHOUT BEING PUNCTURED BY A BULLET
4014-186183-0013 IT WAS NOW WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON THE GERMANS HAD SWEPT INTO THE PLACES VACATED BY THE AMERICANS AND FRENCH AND STILL THE BATTLE RAGED IT WAS NOW THAT SLIM BEGAN TO WAIT ANXIOUSLY FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT
4014-186183-0015 AND SOON IN GREAT MEASURE AT LEAST HOSTILITIES WOULD BE SUSPENDED FOR THE NIGHT THEIR WORK COMPLETED
4014-186183-0016 SO YOU CAN JUDGE PRETTY WELL FOR YOURSELF GUESS HE HAD A PRETTY GOOD BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE WHOLE THING SAID JOE AS THEY PASSED ON TO MEET AGAIN BEFORE MESS EXCEPT FOR SPASMODIC OUTBURSTS HERE AND THERE THE TRENCH DUEL HAD ALMOST ENTIRELY SUBSIDED
4014-186183-0018 WHILE EACH SIDE TOOK ACCOUNT OF STOCK AND MADE NECESSARY REPAIRS OR ALTERED THEIR PLANS TO MEET THE NEW SITUATION OUR YOUNG FRIENDS WERE BUSY WITH WASH BASIN SOAP AND WATER
4014-186183-0019 TAKING OFF THE GRIME IN PREPARATION FOR THE EVENING MEAL AND WONDERING WHERE JERRY WAS KEEPING HIMSELF ALL THE WHILE WHEN SUDDENLY A VERY STRANGE THING HAPPENED BEYOND THE ENEMY'S LINE
4014-186183-0021 IT SIMPLY INDICATED THAT THOSE MANNING THE AMERICAN AND FRENCH ANTI AIRCRAFT GUNS
4014-186183-0022 AND EVEN THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A WELL DESIGNED HOAX
4014-186183-0024 HE POINTED HER NOSE DOWNWARD TOWARD THE AMERICAN LINES FOUR AMERICAN PLANES SAILED OFF AND UPWARD TO MEET THE ONCOMING GERMAN AIR ARMADA BUT FROM THE GROUND IT COULD BE SEEN THAT THE MAN IN THE OBSERVER'S PLACE IN THE TAUBE WAS MAKING DESPERATE SIGNALS
4014-186183-0025 THE AMERICAN PLANES MANEUVERED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENCIRCLE THE TAUBE
4014-186183-0027 AS THE TAUBE CAME WITHIN A HUNDRED YARDS OF THE GROUND AND RIGHTED HERSELF FOR A LANDING
4014-186183-0028 OF ITS OWN MOMENTUM IT ROLLED TO WITHIN A TWO MINUTES RUN OF WHERE THE LIEUTENANT AND THE OTHERS HAD BEEN STANDING IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT WAS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY A CROWD OF CURIOUS AMERICAN SOLDIERS
4014-186183-0030 BUT SOME OTHER GERMAN AVIATORS SAW THE AFFAIR APPARENTLY RECOGNIZED OUR UNIFORMS AND HARDLY GAVE US TIME TO MAKE A DECENT START SAY JERRY CONCLUDED THEY CERTAINLY DID PEBBLE US WITH MACHINE GUN BULLETS
4014-186183-0031 OPENING THEM THE BOYS COULD HARDLY SUPPRESS THEIR JUBILATION STRIPPED OF THEIR OFFICIAL VERBIAGE THE LETTERS INFORMED THE YOUNG MEN THAT EACH OF THEM WAS MADE A CORPORAL JOE FOR VALOROUS SERVICE IN SAVING THE LIVES OF THREE AMERICANS ENTOMBED IN A CAVE
4018-103416-0001 MILLS AND FACTORIES TOOK ON NEW LIFE LABOR WAS SCARCE AND HIGH IT WAS A PERIOD OF EXTRAVAGANCE RATHER THAN PLEASURE PEOPLE PLAYED THAT THEY MIGHT NOT THINK WASHINGTON CONVINCED THAT THE NATION WOULD ULTIMATELY BE INVOLVED
4018-103416-0002 KEPT ITS SECRET WELL AND CONTINUED TO PREACH A NEUTRALITY IT COULD NOT ENFORCE WAR WAS TO MOST OF THE NATION A GREAT DRAMATIC SPECTACLE PRESENTED TO THEM AT BREAKFAST AND IN THE AFTERNOON EDITIONS

4018-103416-0005 BUT AGAIN WASHINGTON KNEW THAT THE BRITISH AND FRENCH LOSSES AT THE SOMME HAD BEEN FRIGHTFUL THAT THE AMOUNT OF LOST TERRITORY REGAINED WAS NEGLIGIBLE AS AGAINST THE TERRITORY STILL HELD THAT THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE BRITISH ISLANDS WAS ACUTE

4051-10927-0024 WHEN SHE CAME INTO THE BEDROOM HE WAS ALREADY IN BED HIS LIPS WERE STERNLY COMPRESSED AND HIS EYES LOOKED AWAY FROM HER ANNA GOT INTO HER BED AND LAY EXPECTING EVERY MINUTE THAT HE WOULD BEGIN TO SPEAK TO HER AGAIN SHE BOTH FEARED HIS SPEAKING AND WISHED FOR IT
4051-10927-0026 SHE HEARD AN EVEN TRANQUIL SNORE FOR THE FIRST INSTANT ALEXEY ALEXANDROVITCH SEEMED AS IT WERE APPALLED AT HIS OWN SNORING AND CEASED BUT AFTER AN INTERVAL OF TWO BREATHINGS THE SNORE SOUNDED AGAIN
4051-10927-0027 WITH A NEW TRANQUIL RHYTHM IT'S LATE IT'S LATE SHE WHISPERED WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0001 AND HAD SPENT THEIR PLAY DAYS IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE GROVE IN THE CENTER OF WHICH THE GOLDEN FLEECE WAS HANGING UPON A TREE THEY WERE NOW ON THEIR WAY TO GREECE IN HOPES OF GETTING BACK A KINGDOM THAT HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY TAKEN FROM THEIR FATHER
4051-11217-0002 WHEN THE PRINCES UNDERSTOOD WHITHER THE ARGONAUTS WERE GOING THEY OFFERED TO TURN BACK AND GUIDE THEM TO COLCHIS
4051-11217-0004 I DO NOT WONDER THAT YOU THINK THE DRAGON VERY TERRIBLE YOU HAVE GROWN UP FROM INFANCY IN THE FEAR OF THIS MONSTER
4051-11217-0005 AT ALL EVENTS TURN BACK WHO MAY I WILL NEVER SEE GREECE AGAIN UNLESS I CARRY WITH ME THE GOLDEN FLEECE WE WILL NONE OF US TURN BACK CRIED HIS NINE AND FORTY BRAVE COMRADES
4051-11217-0007 AND NOTHING SO TRULY HONORABLE AS TO BE EATEN UP AT ONE MOUTHFUL IN CASE OF THE WORST AFTER THIS BEING NOW UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF THE TWO PRINCES WHO WERE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE WAY
4051-11217-0008 HEARD OF THEIR ARRIVAL HE INSTANTLY SUMMONED JASON TO COURT
4051-11217-0010 PRAY ARE YOU ON A PLEASURE VOYAGE
4051-11217-0011 OR WHAT OTHER CAUSE HAS PROCURED ME THE HAPPINESS OF SEEING YOU AT MY COURT GREAT SIR REPLIED JASON
4051-11217-0013 PROVIDED I BRING HIM THE GOLDEN FLEECE THIS AS YOUR MAJESTY IS AWARE IS NOW HANGING ON A TREE HERE AT COLCHIS AND I HUMBLY SOLICIT YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE TO TAKE IT AWAY IN SPITE OF HIMSELF THE KING'S FACE TWISTED ITSELF INTO AN ANGRY FROWN
4051-11217-0014 FOR ABOVE ALL THINGS ELSE IN THE WORLD HE PRIZED THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND WAS EVEN SUSPECTED OF HAVING DONE A VERY WICKED ACT IN ORDER TO GET IT INTO HIS OWN POSSESSION
4051-11217-0016 WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS WHICH YOU MUST FULFILL BEFORE GETTING POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE I HAVE HEARD REJOINED THE YOUTH THAT A DRAGON LIES BENEATH THE TREE ON WHICH THE PRIZE HANGS AND THAT WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM RUNS THE RISK OF BEING DEVOURED AT A MOUTHFUL
4051-11217-0017 TRUE SAID THE KING WITH A SMILE THAT DID NOT LOOK PARTICULARLY GOOD NATURED VERY TRUE YOUNG MAN BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AS HARD OR PERHAPS A LITTLE HARDER TO BE DONE BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING DEVOURED BY THE DRAGON FOR EXAMPLE
4051-11217-0019 I MUST ENCOUNTER THE PERIL ANSWERED JASON COMPOSEDLY SINCE IT STANDS IN THE WAY OF MY PURPOSE
4051-11217-0020 FROM WHICH CADMUS RAISED A CROP OF ARMED MEN THEY ARE AN UNRULY SET OF REPROBATES THOSE SONS OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH AND UNLESS YOU TREAT THEM SUITABLY THEY WILL FALL UPON YOU SWORD IN HAND
4051-11217-0022 MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE FOR TO DAY AND TO MORROW MORNING SINCE YOU INSIST UPON IT YOU SHALL TRY YOUR SKILL AT THE PLOW WHILE THE KING TALKED WITH JASON A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WAS STANDING BEHIND THE THRONE SHE FIXED HER EYES EARNESTLY UPON THE YOUTHFUL STRANGER
4051-11217-0023 THIS YOUNG WOMAN FOLLOWED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM I AM THE KING'S DAUGHTER SHE SAID TO HIM AND MY NAME IS MEDEA I KNOW A GREAT DEAL OF WHICH OTHER YOUNG PRINCESSES ARE IGNORANT AND CAN DO MANY THINGS WHICH THEY WOULD BE AFRAID SO MUCH AS TO DREAM OF IF YOU WILL TRUST TO ME
4051-11217-0025 HE BEHELD A WONDERFUL INTELLIGENCE IN HER FACE SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE PERSONS WHOSE EYES ARE FULL OF MYSTERY SO THAT WHILE LOOKING INTO THEM
4051-11217-0026 YET CAN NEVER BE CERTAIN WHETHER YOU SEE INTO THE FARTHEST DEPTHS OR WHETHER THERE BE NOT SOMETHING ELSE HIDDEN AT THE BOTTOM IF JASON HAD BEEN CAPABLE OF FEARING ANYTHING
4051-11217-0028 PRINCESS HE EXCLAIMED YOU SEEM INDEED VERY WISE AND VERY POWERFUL BUT HOW CAN YOU HELP ME TO DO THE THINGS OF WHICH YOU SPEAK ARE YOU AN ENCHANTRESS YES PRINCE JASON ANSWERED MEDEA WITH A SMILE
4051-11217-0029 IT IS WELL FOR YOU THAT I AM FAVORABLY INCLINED FOR OTHERWISE YOU WOULD HARDLY ESCAPE BEING SNAPPED UP BY THE DRAGON I SHOULD NOT SO MUCH CARE FOR THE DRAGON REPLIED JASON IF I ONLY KNEW HOW TO MANAGE THE BRAZEN FOOTED AND FIERY LUNGED BULLS
4051-11217-0031 WHICH IT CONTAINED AND WHERE TO MEET HER AT MIDNIGHT ONLY BE BRAVE ADDED SHE AND BEFORE DAYBREAK THE BRAZEN BULLS SHALL BE TAMED THE YOUNG MAN ASSURED HER THAT HIS HEART WOULD NOT FAIL HIM HE THEN REJOINED HIS COMRADES AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THE PRINCESS AND HIMSELF
4051-11217-0032 AND WARNED THEM TO BE IN READINESS IN CASE THERE MIGHT BE NEED OF THEIR HELP AT THE APPOINTED HOUR HE MET THE BEAUTIFUL MEDEA ON THE MARBLE STEPS OF THE KING'S PALACE
4051-11217-0034 WITH A BRIGHT GLEAM ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE SKY
4051-11217-0035 IN THAT FARTHEST CORNER OF THE FIELD IT WILL BE EXCELLENT SPORT I ASSURE YOU WHEN THEY CATCH A GLIMPSE OF YOUR FIGURE MY FATHER AND ALL HIS COURT DELIGHT IN NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE A STRANGER TRYING TO YOKE THEM IN ORDER TO COME AT THE GOLDEN FLEECE
4051-11217-0037 THE INSTANT HE MADE A STEP FARTHER
4051-11217-0038 THESE YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WERE CAUSED BY THE BREATH OF THE BRAZEN BULLS WHICH WAS QUIETLY STEALING OUT OF THEIR FOUR NOSTRILS AS THEY LAY CHEWING THEIR CUDS AT THE FIRST TWO OR THREE STEPS WHICH JASON MADE
4051-11217-0040 ONE OTHER STRIDE DID BOLD JASON MAKE AND SUDDENLY AS A STREAK OF LIGHTNING ON CAME THESE FIERY ANIMALS
4051-11217-0041 AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE FASHION WITH ANGRY BULLS THEIR BREATH SCORCHED THE HERBAGE BEFORE THEM SO INTENSELY HOT IT WAS INDEED THAT IT CAUGHT A DRY TREE UNDER WHICH JASON WAS NOW STANDING AND SET IT ALL IN A LIGHT BLAZE BUT AS FOR JASON HIMSELF
4051-11218-0001 JUST AS THE BRAZEN BRUTES FANCIED THEMSELVES SURE OF TOSSING HIM INTO THE AIR HE CAUGHT ONE OF THEM BY THE HORN AND THE OTHER BY HIS SCREWED UP TAIL AND HELD THEM IN A GRIPE LIKE THAT OF AN IRON VICE ONE WITH HIS RIGHT HAND THE OTHER WITH HIS LEFT
4051-11218-0002 TO BE SURE BUT THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WAS THAT THE BRAZEN BULLS WERE ENCHANTED CREATURES AND THAT JASON HAD BROKEN THE SPELL OF THEIR FIERY FIERCENESS BY HIS BOLD WAY OF HANDLING THEM AND EVER SINCE THAT TIME
4051-11218-0004 IT WAS NOW EASY TO YOKE THE BULLS AND TO HARNESS THEM TO THE PLOW
4051-11218-0005 WHO PERHAPS USED TO ALLOW HIMSELF TO BE HARNESSED TO THE PLOW AT ANY RATE OUR HERO SUCCEEDED PERFECTLY WELL IN BREAKING UP THE GREENSWARD AND BY THE TIME THAT THE MOON WAS A QUARTER OF HER JOURNEY UP THE SKY THE PLOWED FIELD LAY BEFORE HIM
4051-11218-0007 MUST WE WAIT LONG FOR HARVEST TIME HE INQUIRED OF MEDEA WHO WAS NOW STANDING BY HIS SIDE WHETHER SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BE SURE TO COME ANSWERED THE PRINCESS A CROP OF ARMED MEN NEVER FAILS TO SPRING UP WHEN THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN
4051-11218-0008 AND WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE THE YELLOW GRAIN WOULD BE RIPENED FOR THE SICKLE BUT BY AND BY ALL OVER THE FIELD
4051-11218-0010 TORE THEMSELVES UP BY THE ROOTS WHEREVER A DRAGON'S TOOTH HAD FALLEN THERE STOOD A MAN ARMED FOR BATTLE THEY MADE A CLANGOR WITH THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND EYED ONE ANOTHER FIERCELY
4051-11218-0011 FULL OF RAGE AND STORMY PASSIONS AND READY TO TAKE THE LIFE OF EVERY HUMAN BROTHER IN RECOMPENSE OF THE BOON OF THEIR OWN EXISTENCE
4051-11218-0013 CLASHING THEIR SWORDS AGAINST THEIR SHIELDS AND BOILING OVER WITH THE RED HOT THIRST FOR BATTLE THEN THEY BEGAN TO SHOUT SHOW US THE ENEMY LEAD US TO THE CHARGE DEATH OR VICTORY COME ON BRAVE COMRADES CONQUER OR DIE
4051-11218-0014 AND A HUNDRED OTHER OUTCRIES SUCH AS MEN ALWAYS BELLOW FORTH ON A BATTLE FIELD AND WHICH THESE DRAGON PEOPLE SEEMED TO HAVE AT THEIR TONGUES ENDS AT LAST THE FRONT RANK CAUGHT SIGHT OF JASON WHO BEHOLDING THE FLASH OF SO MANY WEAPONS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4051-11218-0016 THE ARMED MEN WERE NOW SO NIGH THAT JASON COULD DISCERN THE FIRE FLASHING OUT OF THEIR ENRAGED EYES WHEN HE LET FLY THE STONE AND SAW IT STRIKE THE HELMET OF A TALL WARRIOR WHO WAS RUSHING UPON HIM WITH HIS BLADE ALOFT
4051-11218-0017 AND INSTEAD OF RUNNING ANY FARTHER TOWARDS JASON THEY BEGAN TO FIGHT AMONG THEMSELVES THE CONFUSION SPREAD THROUGH THE HOST
4051-11218-0019 FOR AN OFFENSE WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD COMMITTED IN AN INCREDIBLY SHORT SPACE OF TIME ALMOST AS SHORT INDEED AS IT HAD TAKEN THEM TO GROW UP ALL BUT ONE OF THE HEROES OF THE DRAGON'S TEETH WERE STRETCHED LIFELESS ON THE FIELD
4051-11218-0020 THE LAST SURVIVOR THE BRAVEST AND STRONGEST OF THE WHOLE HAD JUST FORCE ENOUGH TO WAVE HIS CRIMSON SWORD OVER HIS HEAD AND GIVE A SHOUT OF EXULTATION CRYING VICTORY VICTORY IMMORTAL FAME
4051-11218-0022 LET THEM SLEEP IN THE BED OF HONOR SAID THE PRINCESS MEDEA WITH A SLY SMILE AT JASON THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS HAVE SIMPLETONS ENOUGH JUST LIKE THEM FIGHTING AND DYING FOR THEY KNOW NOT WHAT AND FANCYING THAT POSTERITY
4051-11218-0023 WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PUT LAUREL WREATHS ON THEIR RUSTY AND BATTERED HELMETS COULD YOU HELP SMILING PRINCE JASON TO SEE THE SELF CONCEIT OF THAT LAST FELLOW
4051-11218-0025 THAT THE FIRST PART OF YOUR ALLOTTED TASK IS FULFILLED
4051-11218-0026 ENTERING THE PRESENCE CHAMBER HE STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE THRONE AND MADE A LOW OBEISANCE YOUR EYES LOOK HEAVY PRINCE JASON OBSERVED THE KING YOU APPEAR TO HAVE SPENT A SLEEPLESS NIGHT
4051-11218-0028 THE FIELD HAS BEEN PLOWED THE DRAGON'S TEETH HAVE BEEN SOWN BROADCAST AND HARROWED INTO THE SOIL
4051-11218-0029 AND DEPART WITH MY NINE AND FORTY COMRADES
4051-11218-0031 AND THE DRAGON'S TEETH THE KING FEARED THAT HE WOULD BE EQUALLY SUCCESSFUL IN SLAYING THE DRAGON AND THEREFORE THOUGH HE WOULD GLADLY HAVE SEEN JASON SNAPPED UP AT A MOUTHFUL HE WAS RESOLVED AND IT WAS A VERY WRONG THING OF THIS WICKED POTENTATE
4051-11218-0032 NOT TO RUN ANY FURTHER RISK OF LOSING HIS BELOVED FLEECE YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THIS BUSINESS YOUNG MAN SAID HE IF MY UNDUTIFUL DAUGHTER MEDEA HAD NOT HELPED YOU WITH HER ENCHANTMENTS HAD YOU ACTED FAIRLY YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THIS INSTANT
4051-11218-0034 MARCH AT ONCE TO THE GROVE OF MARS SLAY THE DRAGON TAKE POSSESSION OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE GET ON BOARD THE ARGO AND SPREAD ALL SAIL FOR IOLCHOS THE SUCCESS OF THIS SCHEME DEPENDED IT IS TRUE ON THE DOUBTFUL POINT
4051-11218-0035 AT SO MANY MOUTHFULS BY THE DRAGON BUT AS JASON WAS HASTENING DOWN THE PALACE STEPS
4051-11218-0037 WILL HE GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE WITHOUT ANY FURTHER RISK OR TROUBLE ON THE CONTRARY ANSWERED JASON HE IS VERY ANGRY WITH ME FOR TAMING THE BRAZEN BULLS AND SOWING THE DRAGON'S TEETH
4051-11218-0038 AND HE FORBIDS ME TO MAKE ANY MORE ATTEMPTS AND POSITIVELY REFUSES TO GIVE UP THE GOLDEN FLEECE WHETHER I SLAY THE DRAGON OR NO YES JASON SAID THE PRINCESS AND I CAN TELL YOU MORE UNLESS YOU SET SAIL FROM COLCHIS
4051-11218-0040 LOWING NODDING THEIR HEADS AND THRUSTING FORTH THEIR SNOUTS WHICH AS OTHER CATTLE DO
4051-11218-0041 THEIR FIERCE NATURE WAS THOROUGHLY TAMED AND WITH THEIR FIERCENESS THE TWO FURNACES IN THEIR STOMACHS HAD LIKEWISE BEEN EXTINGUISHED
4051-11218-0043 HOW THEY CONTRIVED TO KEEP THEMSELVES ALIVE IS MORE THAN I CAN IMAGINE BUT NOW INSTEAD OF EMITTING JETS OF FLAME AND STREAMS OF SULPHUROUS VAPOR THEY BREATHED THE VERY SWEETEST OF COW BREATH AFTER KINDLY PATTING THE BULLS
4051-11218-0044 JASON FOLLOWED MEDEA'S GUIDANCE INTO THE GROVE OF MARS WHERE THE GREAT OAK TREES THAT HAD BEEN GROWING FOR CENTURIES THREW SO THICK A SHADE THAT THE MOONBEAMS STRUGGLED VAINLY TO FIND THEIR WAY THROUGH IT
4051-11218-0046 WHAT IS IT ASKED JASON HAVE YOU COME SO FAR TO SEEK IT
4051-11218-0047 WHEN IT GLITTERS BEFORE YOUR EYES IT IS THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON WENT ONWARD A FEW STEPS FARTHER AND THEN STOPPED TO GAZE O HOW BEAUTIFUL IT LOOKED SHINING WITH A MARVELOUS LIGHT OF ITS OWN THAT
4051-11218-0049 THE TERRIBLE DRAGON HAD QUITE SLIPPED OUT OF JASON'S MEMORY SOON HOWEVER SOMETHING CAME TO PASS THAT REMINDED HIM WHAT PERILS WERE STILL TO BE ENCOUNTERED AN ANTELOPE THAT PROBABLY MISTOOK THE YELLOW RADIANCE FOR SUNRISE CAME
4051-11218-0050 FOR HE WAS TWISTED ROUND THE TRUNK OF THE TREE ON WHICH THE FLEECE HUNG AND SEIZING THE POOR ANTELOPE SWALLOWED HIM WITH ONE SNAP OF HIS JAWS AFTER THIS FEAT THE DRAGON SEEMED SENSIBLE THAT SOME OTHER LIVING CREATURE WAS WITHIN REACH
4051-11218-0052 UPON MY WORD AS THE HEAD CAME WAVING AND UNDULATING THROUGH THE AIR AND REACHING ALMOST WITHIN ARM'S LENGTH OF PRINCE JASON IT WAS A VERY HIDEOUS AND UNCOMFORTABLE SIGHT
4051-11218-0053 THE GAPE OF HIS ENORMOUS JAWS WAS NEARLY AS WIDE AS THE GATEWAY OF THE KING'S PALACE WELL JASON WHISPERED MEDEA FOR SHE WAS ILL NATURED AS ALL ENCHANTRESSES ARE AND WANTED TO MAKE THE BOLD YOUTH TREMBLE
4051-11218-0055 FAR MORE EFFECTUALLY THAN YOUR SWORD THE DRAGON HAD PROBABLY HEARD THE VOICES FOR SWIFT AS LIGHTNING HIS BLACK HEAD AND FORKED TONGUE CAME HISSING AMONG THE TREES AGAIN DARTING FULL FORTY FEET AT A STRETCH AS IT APPROACHED
4051-11218-0056 MEDEA TOSSED THE CONTENTS OF THE GOLD BOX RIGHT DOWN THE MONSTER'S WIDE OPEN THROAT IMMEDIATELY WITH AN OUTRAGEOUS HISS AND A TREMENDOUS WRIGGLE FLINGING HIS TAIL UP TO THE TIP TOP OF THE TALLEST TREE
4051-11218-0058 SO I DID NOT WISH TO KILL HIM OUTRIGHT QUICK SNATCH THE PRIZE AND LET US BEGONE YOU HAVE WON THE GOLDEN FLEECE JASON CAUGHT THE FLEECE FROM THE TREE
4051-11218-0059 WITH HER PEACOCK BESIDE HER SHE CLAPPED HER HANDS FOR JOY AND BECKONING HIM TO MAKE HASTE DISAPPEARED AMONG THE DUSKINESS OF THE TREES
4051-11218-0061 ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STONE WALLS A HILL AND THE BLACK SHADOWS OF THE GROVE OF MARS INTERVENED BETWEEN BY HIS ADVICE THE HEROES HAD SEATED THEMSELVES ON THE BENCHES OF THE GALLEY
4051-11218-0062 HELD PERPENDICULARLY READY TO LET FALL INTO THE WATER AS JASON DREW NEAR HE HEARD THE TALKING IMAGE CALLING TO HIM WITH MORE THAN ORDINARY EAGERNESS IN ITS GRAVE SWEET VOICE MAKE HASTE PRINCE JASON FOR YOUR LIFE MAKE HASTE
4088-158077-0001 WE WERE FACE TO FACE WITH THE QUESTION WHICH WE HAD CONSIDERED AT THE CONVENTION THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHEN WAR WAS RUMORED AS TO WHAT POSITION WE AS AN ORGANIZATION SHOULD TAKE IN THIS SITUATION THE ATMOSPHERE OF THAT CONVENTION HAD BEEN DRAMATIC IN THE EXTREME
4088-158077-0002 MOST OF THE DELEGATES ASSEMBLED HAD BEEN APPROACHED EITHER BEFORE GOING TO WASHINGTON OR UPON ARRIVING AND URGED TO USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO PERSUADE THE ORGANIZATION TO ABANDON ITS WORK FOR THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN AND TURN ITS ACTIVITIES INTO WAR CHANNELS
4088-158077-0004 THE PRESIDENT WILL TURN THIS IMPERIALISTIC WAR INTO A CRUSADE FOR DEMOCRACY LAY ASIDE YOUR OWN FIGHT AND HELP US CRUSH GERMANY AND YOU WILL FIND YOURSELVES REWARDED WITH A VOTE OUT OF THE NATION'S GRATITUDE WERE SOME OF THE APPEALS MADE TO OUR WOMEN BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HIGH AND LOW
4088-158077-0005 AND BY THE RANK AND FILE OF MEN AND WOMEN NEVER IN HISTORY DID A BAND OF WOMEN STAND TOGETHER WITH MORE SANITY AND GREATER SOLIDARITY THAN DID THESE ONE THOUSAND DELEGATES REPRESENTING THOUSANDS MORE THROUGHOUT THE STATES AS OUR OFFICIAL ORGAN THE SUFFRAGIST
4088-158077-0007 WE WERE UNITED ON NO OTHER SUBJECT SOME WOULD OFFER PASSIVE RESISTANCE TO THE WAR OTHERS WOULD BECOME DEVOTED FOLLOWERS OF A VIGOROUS MILITARY POLICY BETWEEN THESE EVERY SHADE OF OPINION WAS REPRESENTED EACH WAS LOYAL TO THE IDEAS WHICH SHE HELD FOR HER COUNTRY
4088-158077-0008 HAD NOTHING TO DO IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH THE EFFORT TO OBTAIN FOR WOMEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE EFFECTIVE EXPRESSION THROUGH POLITICAL POWER TO THEIR IDEALS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT BE
4088-158077-0010 BELIEVING AS THE CONVENTION STATED IN ITS RESOLUTIONS THAT IN SO DOING THE ORGANIZATION SERVES THE HIGHEST INTEREST OF THE COUNTRY
4088-158077-0011 THEY WERE ALSO UNANIMOUS IN THE OPINION THAT ALL SERVICE WHICH INDIVIDUALS WISHED TO GIVE TO WAR OR PEACE SHOULD BE GIVEN THROUGH GROUPS ORGANIZED FOR SUCH PURPOSES
4088-158077-0013 AND ANNOUNCED THAT NO SUBJECTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THEM UNLESS THE PRESIDENT URGED THEM AS WAR MEASURES OUR TASK WAS FROM THAT TIME ON TO MAKE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE A WAR MEASURE WE AT ONCE URGED UPON THE ADMINISTRATION THE WISDOM OF ACCEPTING THIS PROPOSED REFORM AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0014 AND POINTED OUT THE DIFFICULTY OF WAGING A WAR FOR DEMOCRACY ABROAD WHILE DEMOCRACY WAS DENIED AT HOME BUT THE GOVERNMENT WAS NOT WILLING TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCE OF ITS ALLIES IN EXTENDING SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN WITHOUT FIRST OFFERING A TERRIBLE AND BRUTAL RESISTANCE
4088-158077-0016 COMPARE THE METHODS WOMEN ADOPTED TO THOSE MEN USE IN THE PURSUIT OF DEMOCRACY
4088-158077-0017 BAYONETS MACHINE GUNS POISON GAS DEADLY GRENADES LIQUID FIRE BOMBS ARMORED TANKS PISTOLS BARBED WIRE ENTANGLEMENTS SUBMARINES MINES EVERY KNOWN SCIENTIFIC DEVICE WITH WHICH TO ANNIHILATE THE ENEMY
4088-158077-0019 JUST AS OUR POLITICAL STRATEGY HAD BEEN TO OPPOSE AT ELECTIONS THE PARTY IN POWER WHICH HAD FAILED TO USE ITS POWER TO FREE WOMEN SO NOW OUR MILITARY STRATEGY WAS BASED ON THE MILITARY DOCTRINE OF CONCENTRATING ALL ONE'S FORCES ON THE ENEMY'S WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0020 AND THE DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME THIS WAS THE UNTENABLE POSITION OF PRESIDENT WILSON AND THE DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATION FROM WHICH WE MUST FORCE THEM TO RETREAT WE COULD FORCE SUCH A RETREAT WHEN WE HAD EXPOSED TO THE WORLD THIS WEAKEST POINT
4088-158077-0022 HERE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THEIR DEMOCRATIC ASPIRATIONS HERE WAS A KIND OF UNIVERSAL MOSES EXPECTED TO LEAD ALL PEOPLES OUT OF BONDAGE NO MATTER WHAT THE BONDAGE NO MATTER OF HOW LONG STANDING
4088-158077-0023 IT WAS AN ADVANTAGE TO US IN THAT IT MADE OUR ATTACK MORE DRAMATIC ONE SUPPOSED TO BE IMPECCABLE WAS MORE VULNERABLE IT WAS A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS UNIVERSAL TRUST AND WORLD WIDE POPULARITY
4088-158077-0025 IN OUR CAPACITY TO EMBARRASS MISTER WILSON IN HIS ADMINISTRATION LAY OUR ONLY HOPE OF SUCCESS
4088-158077-0026 WE INTENDED TO KNOW WHY IF DEMOCRACY WERE SO PRECIOUS AS TO DEMAND THE NATION'S BLOOD AND TREASURE FOR ITS ACHIEVEMENT ABROAD ITS EXECUTION AT HOME WAS SO UNDESIRABLE MEANWHILE
4088-158077-0028 AND IF HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO MY ADVICE I AM GOING TO MAKE IT AS UNPLEASANT AS I CAN PRESIDENT WILSON
4088-158077-0029 SOME RUMBLINGS OF POLITICAL ACTION BEGAN TO BE HEARD THE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY HAD APPOINTED A SENATE COMMITTEE ON WOMAN SUFFRAGE WHOSE MEMBERS WERE OVERWHELMINGLY FOR FEDERAL ACTION THE CHAIRMAN SENATOR ANDREAS JONES OF NEW MEXICO
4088-158077-0031 IN ADDITION TO THIS PLANK THEY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION CALLING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME
4088-158077-0032 AND INSTRUCTING THE CHAIRMAN OF THE CONVENTION TO REQUEST A COMMITTEE CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL LIBERAL GROUPS
4088-158077-0034 MISTER JOHN SPARGO OF THE SOCIALIST PARTY MISTER VIRGIL HINSHAW CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE PROHIBITION PARTY AND MISS MABEL VERNON SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL WOMAN'S PARTY
4088-158077-0035 THE PRESIDENT WAS DEEPLY MOVED INDEED ALMOST TO THE POINT OF TEARS WHEN MISS MABEL VERNON SAID MISTER PRESIDENT THE FEELINGS OF MANY WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY ARE BEST EXPRESSED BY YOUR OWN WORDS IN YOUR WAR MESSAGE TO CONGRESS
4088-158077-0037 ADVISING AN IMMEDIATE REPORT ON THE SUFFRAGE RESOLUTION AS HAVE ASKED FOR THE CREATION OF ANOTHER COMMITTEE TO REPORT ON THE SUBJECT HE MADE NO MENTION OF HIS STATE BY STATE CONVICTION HOWEVER AS HE HAD IN PREVIOUS INTERVIEWS
4088-158077-0038 AND THE COMMITTEE OF PROGRESSIVES UNDERSTOOD HIM TO HAVE AT LEAST TACITLY ACCEPTED FEDERAL ACTION THE HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE CONTINUED TO REFUSE TO ACT AND THE HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE STEADILY REFUSED TO CREATE A SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0040 THE AUTHORIZATION OF AN EXPENDITURE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ERECTION OF A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AS A LEGITIMATE WAR MEASURE IT WAS CLEAR FROM THE PARTISAN ATTITUDE OF THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE DEBATE
4088-158077-0041 THAT WE WERE ADVANCING TO THAT POSITION WHERE WE WERE AS GOOD POLITICAL MATERIAL TO BE CONTESTED OVER BY OPPOSING POLITICAL GROUPS AS WAS A MONUMENT TO A DEAD PRESIDENT AND IF THE DEMOCRATS COULD DEFEND SUCH AN ISSUE AS A WAR MEASURE
4088-158077-0043 AND BY A VOTE OF SIX TO FIVE DECIDED TO REPORT FAVORABLY ON THE RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR A WOMAN SUFFRAGE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE AFTER ALL PENDING WAR MEASURES HAVE BEEN DISPOSED OF BEFORE THE MEETING
4088-158077-0044 THE PICKETS CONTINUED THEIR VIGIL AND THE MOTION CARRIED STILL UNCERTAIN AS TO THE PURPOSES OF THE REPUBLICANS THE DEMOCRATS WERE MOVED TO FURTHER ACTION
4088-158077-0046 EVIDENTLY AROUSED PROTESTS FROM POWERFUL QUARTERS ALSO THE REPUBLICANS QUICKLY SUBSIDED WHEN THEY SAW THE DEMOCRATS MAKING AN ADVANCE AND SO THE DEMOCRATIC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE BEGAN TO SPREAD ABROAD THE NEWS THAT ITS ACT WAS NOT REALLY OFFICIAL
4088-158077-0047 BUT MERELY REFLECTED THE PERSONAL CONVICTION OF THE MEMBERS PRESENT IT EXTRACTED THE OFFICIAL FLAVOR AND SO OF COURSE NO ACTION FOLLOWED IN CONGRESS AND SO IT WENT LIKE A GREAT GAME OF CHESS
4088-158077-0049 BEHIND THIS MATCHING OF POLITICAL WITS BY THE TWO PARTIES STOOD THE FAITHFUL PICKETS COMPELLING THEM BOTH TO ACT SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH THESE MOVES AND COUNTER MOVES IN POLITICAL CIRCLES THE PEOPLE IN ALL SECTIONS OF THIS VAST COUNTRY BEGAN TO SPEAK THEIR MINDS
4088-158077-0050 MEETINGS WERE SPRINGING UP EVERYWHERE AT WHICH RESOLUTIONS WERE PASSED BACKING UP THE PICKET LINE AND URGING THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO ACT EVEN THE SOUTH THE ADMINISTRATION'S STRONGHOLD SENT FIERY TELEGRAMS DEMANDING ACTION
4088-158077-0052 FOOD CONSERVATION OR WHAT NOT WOMEN FROM UNEX PECTED QUARTERS SENT TO THE GOVERNMENT THEIR PROTEST AGAINST THE PASSAGE OF MEASURES SO VITAL TO WOMEN WITHOUT WOMEN'S CONSENT COUPLED WITH AN APPEAL FOR THE LIBERATION OF WOMEN
4088-158077-0053 CLUB WOMEN COLLEGE WOMEN FEDERATIONS OF LABOR VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS SENT PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION LEADERS THE PICKET LINE APPROACHING ITS SIXTH MONTH OF DUTY HAD AROUSED THE COUNTRY TO AN UNPRECEDENTED INTEREST IN SUF FRAGE
4088-158077-0055 WITHIN ONE MONTH MICHIGAN NEBRASKA AND RHODE ISLAND GRANTED PRESIDENTIAL SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN THE LEADERS WERE BUSY MARSHALING THEIR FORCES BEHIND THE PRESIDENT'S WAR PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED THE CONTROVERSIAL CONSCRIPTION AND ESPIONAGE BILLS THEN PENDING
4088-158077-0056 AND DID NOT RELISH HAVING OUR QUESTION SO VIVID IN THE PUBLIC MIND
4088-158077-0058 THE MANIFESTATIONS OF POPULAR APPROVAL OF SUFFRAGE THE CONSTANT STREAM OF PROTESTS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AGAINST ITS DELAY NATIONALLY AND THE SHAME OF HAVING WOMEN BEGGING AT ITS GATES COULD RESULT IN ONLY ONE OF TWO THINGS
4088-158077-0059 THE ADMINISTRATION HAD LITTLE CHOICE IT MUST YIELD TO THIS PRESSURE FROM THE PEOPLE OR IT MUST SUPPRESS THE AGITATION WHICH WAS CAUSING SUCH INTEREST IT MUST PASS THE AMENDMENT OR REMOVE THE TROUBLESOME PICKETS IT DECIDED TO REMOVE THE PICKETS
4088-158077-0061 THIS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF THE ADOPTION BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF TACTICS FROM WHICH THEY COULD NEVER EXTRICATE THEMSELVES WITH HONOR UNFORTUNATELY FOR THEM THEY WERE ENTERING UPON THIS POLICY TOWARD WOMEN WHICH SAVORED OF CZARIST PRACTICES
4088-158077-0062 AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY WERE CONGRATULATING THE RUSSIANS UPON THEIR LIBERATION FROM THE OPPRESSION OF A CZAR THIS FACT SUPPLIED US WITH A FRESH ANGLE OF ATTACK PRESIDENT WILSON SENT A MISSION TO RUSSIA TO ADD AMERICA'S APPEAL TO THAT OF THE OTHER ALLIES TO KEEP THAT IMPOVERISHED COUNTRY IN THE WAR
4088-158077-0064 THIS OCCASION OFFERED US THE OPPORTUNITY AGAIN TO EXPOSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S WEAKNESS IN CLAIMING COMPLETE POLITICAL DEMOCRACY WHILE WOMEN WERE STILL DENIED THEIR POLITICAL FREEDOM
4088-158077-0065 AS THE CAR CARRYING THE ENVOYS PASSED SWIFTLY THROUGH THE GATES OF THE WHITE HOUSE THERE STOOD ON THE PICKET LINE TWO SILENT SENTINELS MISS LUCY BURNS OF NEW YORK AND MISSUS LAWRENCE LEWIS OF PHILADELPHIA BOTH MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
4088-158077-0067 TWENTY MILLION AMERI CAN WOMEN ARE DENIED THE RIGHT TO VOTE PRESI DENT WILSON IS THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THEIR NA TIONAL ENFRANCHISEMENT HELP US MAKE THIS NATION REALLY FREE TELL OUR GOVERNMENT IT MUST LIBERATE ITS PEOPLE BEFORE IT CAN CLAIM FREE RUSSIA AS AN ALLY
4088-158077-0068 RUMORS THAT THE SUFFRAGISTS WOULD MAKE A SPECIAL DEMONSTRATION BEFORE THE RUSSIAN MISSION HAD BROUGHT A GREAT CROWD TO THE FAR GATE OF THE WHITE HOUSE A CROWD COMPOSED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF MEN
4088-158077-0070 THERE WAS THE CRITICISM IN THE PRESS AND ON THE LIPS OF MEN THAT WE WERE EMBARRASSING OUR GOVERNMENT BEFORE THE EYES OF FOREIGN VISITORS IN ANSWERING THE CRITICISM MISS PAUL PUBLICLY STATED OUR POSITION THUS
4088-158077-0071 CAN BE CHANGED IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR PROTEST IS THEREFORE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND NOT WITH THE WOMEN OF AMERICA IF THE LACK OF DEMOCRACY AT HOME WEAKENS THE ADMINISTRATION
4088-158077-0073 WHAT A PICTURE COMMON DECENCY TOLD THE MORE HUMANE LEADERS THAT THIS WOULD NEVER DO I DARESAY POLITICAL WISDOM CREPT INTO THE REASONING OF OTHERS CLOSING THE WOMAN'S PARTY HEADQUARTERS WAS DISCUSSED PERHAPS A RAID AND ALL FOR WHAT
4088-158077-0074 BECAUSE WOMEN WERE HOLDING BANNERS ASKING FOR THE PRECIOUS PRINCIPLE AT HOME THAT MEN WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DYING FOR ABROAD FINALLY A DECISION WAS REACHED EMBODYING THE COMBINED WISDOM OF ALL THE VARIOUS CONFEREES

4137-11701-0045 WAS IT FAIR TO DISAPPOINT ONE WHO HAD PERHAPS SOME LITTLE GROUNDS FOR AFTER ALL HE HAD BEEN NO MORE GALLANT THAN WAS CUSTOMARY FROM A PRINCE AND A GENTLEMAN TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IT WAS HER OWN FAULT IF SHE HAD MISTAKEN HIS INTENTIONS
4137-11701-0046 OF COURSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE LEFT EURALIA LONG AGO BUT HE HAD STAYED ON AND WELL DECIDEDLY SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL PERHAPS HE HAD PAID RATHER TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT AND HE HAD CERTAINLY NEGLECTED THE PRINCESS A LITTLE
4137-11701-0048 THE POOR WOMAN HAD MISUNDERSTOOD HIM AND SHE SHOULD NOT BE DISAPPOINTED SHE SEEMS FOND OF FLOWERS SAID CORONEL YOU OUGHT TO MAKE THE PALACE GARDEN LOOK BEAUTIFUL BETWEEN YOU NOW UNDERSTAND CLEARLY CORONEL

4137-11702-0001 SO FAR AS IS KNOWN THIS WAS HER ONLY WORK BUT SHE BUILT UP SOME REPUTATION ON IT AND BELVANE WHO WAS A GOOD JUDGE HAD A HIGH OPINION OF HER GENIUS TO BE EXACT THERE WERE ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY NINE MEN
4137-11702-0002 HENRY SMALLNOSE A BOWMAN OF CONSIDERABLE PROMISE HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN THE ENEMY'S COUNTRY THE ONE CASUALTY OF WAR WHILE SPYING OUT THE LAND IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INVASION
4137-11702-0004 HENRY HAVING CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE CHIEF ARMOURER'S DAUGHTER HAD ACCEPTED WITHOUT ANY FALSE PRIDE AND HAD FREQUENTLY DROPPED IN TO SUPPER THEREAFTER NOW THAT THE WAR WAS OVER HE FOUND THAT HE COULD NOT TEAR HIMSELF AWAY
4137-11702-0005 WITH KING MERRIWIG'S PERMISSION HE WAS SETTLING IN BARODIA AND WITH THE CHIEF ARMOURER'S PERMISSION HE WAS STARTING ON HIS NEW LIFE AS A MARRIED MAN AS THE TOWERS OF THE CASTLE CAME IN SIGHT MERRIWIG DREW A DEEP BREATH OF HAPPINESS HOME AGAIN
4137-11702-0007 POOR LITTLE HYACINTH LEFT ALL ALONE BUT THERE SHE HAD HAD THE COUNTESS BELVANE A WOMAN OF GREAT EXPERIENCE TO HELP HER BELVANE SHOULD HE RISK IT HOW MUCH HAD SHE THOUGHT OF HIM WHILE HE WAS AWAY
4137-11702-0008 HYACINTH WOULD BE GROWING UP AND GETTING MARRIED SOON LIFE WOULD BE LONELY IN EURALIA THEN UNLESS SHOULD HE RISK IT
4137-11702-0010 THEN I SHALL SAY NOTHING MUCH ONLY CORONEL AND SUCH A CLEVER OH I HAVE MY IDEAS SAID CORONEL WELL I'LL BE OUT OF THE WAY SOMEWHERE I THINK I'LL GO FOR A WALK IN THE FOREST
4137-11702-0011 OR SHALL I STAY HERE IN THE COUNTESS'S GARDEN AND AMUSE MYSELF WITH UDO ANYHOW I'LL GIVE YOU AN HOUR ALONE TOGETHER FIRST THE CAVALCADE DREW UP IN FRONT OF THE CASTLE HANDKERCHIEFS FLUTTERED TO THEM FROM THE WALLS TRUMPETS WERE BLOWN HOUNDS BAYED

4137-11702-0014 HE TOOK A STEP FORWARD AND ADDRESSED HIS TROOPS MEN OF EURALIA CHEERS WE HAVE RETURNED FROM A LONG AND ARDUOUS CONFLICT CHEERS TO THE EMBRACES LOUD CHEERS
4137-11702-0016 IN HONOUR OF OUR GREAT VICTORY I DECREE THAT FROM NOW ONWARDS TO MORROW SHALL BE OBSERVED AS A HOLIDAY THROUGHOUT EURALIA TERRIFIC CHEERING
4137-11702-0017 HERE HE TURNED AND EMBRACED HIS DAUGHTER AGAIN AND IF HIS EYE TRAVELLED OVER HER SHOULDER IN THE DIRECTION OF BELVANE'S GARDEN IT IS A SMALL MATTER AND ONE FOR WHICH THE ARCHITECT OF THE CASTLE NO DOUBT WAS PRINCIPALLY TO BLAME
4137-11702-0019 NOW FATHER SAID HYACINTH LATER ON WHEN MERRIWIG HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHES AND REFRESHED HIMSELF YOU'VE GOT TO TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE IT'S REALLY OVER YES YES IT'S ALL OVER
4137-11702-0020 SAID MERRIWIG HEARTILY WE SHAN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN THAT DIRECTION AGAIN I FANCY DO TELL ME DID THE KING OF BARODIA APOLOGISE HE DID BETTER THAN THAT HE ABDICATED WHY

4137-11702-0025 BUT SHE WAS STILL ENGROSSED WITH THE WHISKERS
4137-11702-0026 I CAN'T PLANT THEM IN THE GARDEN I THOUGHT WE MIGHT RUN THEM UP THE FLAGSTAFF AS WE DID IN BARODIA ISN'T THAT A LITTLE UNKIND NOW THAT THE POOR MAN'S DEAD MERRIWIG LOOKED ROUND HIM TO SEE THAT THERE WERE NO EAVESDROPPERS
4137-11702-0028 HE TOLD HER OF HIS SECRET JOURNEY TO THE KING OF BARODIA'S TENT HE TOLD HER OF THE KING OF BARODIA'S LETTER
4137-11702-0029 AND HIS BOYISH PLEASURE IN IT ALL WAS SO EVIDENT AND SO INNOCENT

4160-11549-0024 EULOGIZING PRISCILLA AND HER BETROTHED AFFECTIONATELY MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE WOULD BE A RICH MAN SOME OF THESE DAYS AND THEN WHAT A HAPPY LIFE MUST PRISCILLA'S BE SO YOUNG SO BEAUTIFUL SO BELOVED NOT THAT WEALTH BRINGS HAPPINESS MY DEAR MISS THEODORA
4160-11549-0025 RICHES ARE VERY DECEITFUL YOU KNOW BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF SOLID COMFORT IN A GENTEEL SUFFICIENCY TO ALL OF WHICH THEO ACQUIESCED MODESTLY INWARDLY WONDERING IF SHE WAS VERY WRONG IN WISHING THAT OGLETHORPE HAD NOT LEFT THEM QUITE SO EARLY
4160-11549-0027 IT WAS AN AFGHAN MISS ELIZABETH WAS MAKING NOW AND WHEN AT TEA TIME MISTER OGLETHORPE CAME HE FOUND THEODORA NORTH SITTING ON THE HEARTH FLUSHED WITH INDUSTRIOUS ANXIETY AND THROWN INTO REFLECTED GLOW OF BRILLIANT BERLIN WOOL A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG SPIDER IN A GORGEOUS AFGHAN WEB
4160-11549-0028 HER LETTERS WERE NEVER CARELESS OR BEHIND TIME AND NO ONE WAS EVER NEGLECTED IN THE MULTIPLICITY OF MESSAGES SHE WOULD BE THE MOST TRUTHFUL AND FAITHFUL OF LOVING WOMEN A FEW YEARS HENCE THIS HANDSOME THEODORA THERE WAS SOME RESERVE IN HER MANNER TOWARD DENIS THIS EVENING
4160-11549-0030 DRAWING ON HER GLOVES AND BUTTONING HER PRETTY JACKET CLOSE UP TO HER BEAUTIFUL SLENDER DUSKY THROAT DENIS TOOK HIS HAT AND ACCOMPANIED HER TO THE CARRIAGE HE DID NOT WAIT FOR THE FOOTMAN THIS TIME BUT AFTER ASSISTING HER TO GET IN CLOSED THE DOOR HIMSELF
4160-11549-0031 AND NOTHING ON EARTH COULD PREVENT IT BUSINESS HAS UNEXPECTEDLY CALLED ME AWAY FROM LONDON FROM ENGLAND HE EXPLAINED IN A STRANGE YET QUITE STEADY VOICE I AM OBLIGED TO GO TO BELGIUM AT ONCE
4160-11549-0033 BUT I WILL WRITE TO HER FROM MY FIRST STOPPING PLACE I WILL TELL HER SAID THEODORA THANK YOU HE REPLIED COURTEOUSLY AND THEN AFTER A SHORT HESITATION BEGAN AGAIN IN THE TONE HE USED SO OFTEN THE TONE THAT MIGHT BE JEST OR EARNEST
4160-11549-0034 AND NOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE A SUBJECT UPON WHICH I WISH TO ASK YOUR UNBIASED OPINION MY DEAR THEODORA BEFORE I SAY GOOD BYE WHEN A MAN FINDS HIMSELF IN A DANGER WITH WHICH HE CANNOT COMBAT AND REMAIN HUMAN
4160-11549-0036 THIS MORNING WHEN YOU SPOKE TO ME THROUGH THE CARRIAGE WINDOW YOU BEGAN TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT BEING GLAD WERE YOU GOING TO SAY HE BROKE OFF HERE SHARPLY NO HE EXCLAIMED I WILL NOT ASK YOU I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU THEO INTERRUPTED GRAVELY
4160-11549-0037 I WAS GLAD TO SEE YOU AND NOW PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER TELL THE COACHMAN TO DRIVE ON I WILL DELIVER YOUR MESSAGE TO LADY THROCKMORTON AND AS I SHALL NOT SEE YOU AGAIN UNLESS I AM HERE IN JULY OF COURSE YOU WILL COME BACK THEN GOOD BYE MISTER OGLETHORPE
4160-11550-0000 MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE HAS GONE AWAY HE WILL NOT COME BACK AGAIN UNTIL JULY WHEN HE IS TO MARRY MISS GOWER THIS WAS THE LAST ENTRY RECORDED IN THE LITTLE PINK AND GOLD JOURNAL AND AFTER IT CAME A GAP OF MONTHS
4160-11550-0001 IT WAS MIDNIGHT AFTER THE MEMORABLE DAY SPENT IN BROOME STREET THAT THE RECORD WAS MADE AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH SHUT THE BOOK WITH A STARTLED FEELING THAT SHE HAD SHUT WITHIN ITS PAGES AN UNFINISHED PAGE OF HER LIFE IT WAS A STRANGE FEELING TO HAVE COME UPON HER SO SUDDENLY
4160-11550-0003 BUT IT HAD NOT SEEMED WARNING TO A GIRL OF SCARCELY SEVENTEEN YEARS BUT SHE UNDERSTOOD IT NOW SHE HAD UNDERSTOOD IT THE MOMENT HE TOLD HER IN THAT STRAINED STEADY VOICE THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY SHE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE TO LADY THROCKMORTON
4160-11550-0004 AND LISTENED QUIETLY TO HER WANDERING COMMENTS ANSWERING THEM AS BEST SHE COULD SHE HAD WAITED PATIENTLY UNTIL SIR DUGALD'S BARBAROUS ELEVEN O'CLOCK SUPPER WAS OVER AND THEN SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM STIRRED THE FIRE AND DROPPED DOWN UPON THE HEARTH RUG TO THINK IT OVER
4160-11550-0006 THAT SHE WOULD RATHER LOSE HIM KNOWING HE LOVED HER THAN WIN HIM FEELING UNCERTAIN THE GLOW IN HER EYES DIED AWAY IN TEARS BUT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO REALIZE DESPAIR OR ANYTHING LIKE IT THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE CURIOUS ENCHANTMENT OF THE DAY HAD NOT BEEN ALTOGETHER SAD
4160-11550-0007 AND AT SEVENTEEN ONE DOES NOT COMPREHEND THAT FATE CAN BE WHOLLY BITTER OR THAT SOME TURN IN FORTUNE IS NOT IN STORE FOR THE FUTURE HOWEVER HOPELESS THE PRESENT MAY SEEM IN THIS MOOD THE ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE LITTLE JOURNAL AND HAVING MADE IT THEODORA NORTH CRIED A LITTLE HOPED A LITTLE
4160-11550-0009 LADY THROCKMORTON MISSED HIM ALSO BUT SHE HAD THE SOLACE OF HER NOVELS AND HER CHOCOLATE WHICH THEO HAD NOT NOVELS HAD BEEN DELIGHTFUL AT DOWNPORT WHEN THEY WERE READ IN HOURLY FEAR OF THE TASKS THAT ALWAYS INTERFERED TO PREVENT ANY INDULGENCE
4160-11550-0010 BUT IN THOSE DAYS FOR SOME REASON THEY WERE NOT AS SATISFACTORY AS THEY APPEARED ONCE AND SO BEING THROWN ON HER OWN RESOURCES SHE SUCCUMBED TO THE VERY NATURAL GIRLISH WEAKNESS OF FEELING A SORT OF FASCINATION FOR BROOME STREET IT WAS HARD TO RESIST BROOME STREET
4160-11550-0012 AND SHE WAS SURE HER PALE HANDSOME FACE WAS PALER THOUGH OF COURSE THAT WAS EASILY TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY HER LOVER'S ABSENCE SHE WAS A SINGULAR GIRL THIS PRISCILLA GOWER THE FIRST TIME THEO EVER SAW HER DISPLAY AN INTEREST IN ANYBODY OR IN ANYTHING
4160-11550-0013 WAS WHEN SHE FIRST HEARD PAMELA'S LOVE STORY MENTIONED SHE WAS SITTING AT WORK NEAR THEM WHEN THEO CHANCED TO MENTION ARTHUR BRUNWALDE AND TO HER SURPRISE PRISCILLA LOOKED UP FROM HER DESK IMMEDIATELY HE WAS YOUR SISTER'S LOVER WAS HE NOT SHE SAID WITH AN ABRUPT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT
4160-11550-0015 NO SHE REPLIED ALMOST TIMIDLY PAMELA IS FAIRER THAN I AM AND NOT SO TALL WE ARE NOT ALIKE AT ALL I WAS NOT THINKING OF THAT SAID PRISCILLA I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WERE ALIKE IN DISPOSITION I THINK I WAS WONDERING MOST WHETHER YOU WOULD BE AS FAITHFUL AS PAMELA
4160-11550-0016 I REMEMBER HEARING MISTER OGLETHORPE SAY ONCE YOU WOULD BE THEO DROPPED HER IVORY CROCHET NEEDLE AND BENT TO PICK IT UP WITH A BLURRED VISION AND NERVOUS FINGERS I CANNOT TELL SHE SAID
4160-11550-0018 IF I HAD EVER LOVED ANY ONE AS PAMELA LOVED MISTER BRUNWALDE I SHOULD BE LIKE PAMELA SHE SAID I SHOULD NEVER LOVE ANY ONE ELSE FROM THAT TIME SHE FANCIED THAT PRISCILLA GOWER LIKED HER BETTER THAN SHE HAD DONE BEFORE AT ANY RATE SHE TOOK MORE NOTICE OF HER THOUGH SHE WAS NEVER EFFUSIVE OF COURSE
4160-11550-0019 SHE TALKED TO HER OFTENER AND SEEMED TO LISTEN WHILE SHE TALKED EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BUSY AT THE TIME SHE SAID TO HER ONCE THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW PAMELA AND EMBOLDENED BY THIS THEO VENTURED TO BRING ONE OF PAM'S LETTERS TO READ TO HER
4160-11550-0021 THAT FAIRLY MELTED TENDER HEARTED OLD MISS ELIZABETH TO TEARS AND CAUSED HER TO CONFIDE AFTERWARD TO THEO THE FACT THAT SHE HERSELF HAD FELT THE INFLUENCE OF THE TENDER PASSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE BLANDISHMENTS OF A SINGLE GENTLEMAN OF UNCERTAIN AGE
4160-11550-0022 WHOSE PERFORMANCES UPON THE FLUTE HAD BEEN THE MEANS OF WINNING HER AFFECTIONS BUT HAD UNHAPPILY RESULTED IN HIS CONTRACTING A FATAL COLD WHILE SERENADING ON A DAMP EVENING HE USED TO PLAY IN A COTTAGE NEAR A WOOD MY DEAR MOST BEAUTIFULLY SAID MISS ELIZABETH WILD WITH PATHOS
4160-11550-0024 HE WAS THE ONLY LOVER I EVER HAD MY DEAR THEODORA AND HIS NAME WAS ELDERBERRY A VERY SINGULAR NAME BY THE WAY BUT HE WAS A VERY TALENTED MAN WHEN THEO WENT INTO THE LITTLE BACK BEDROOM THAT EVENING TO PUT ON HER HAT PRISCILLA GOWER WENT WITH HER
4160-11550-0025 AND AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE DRESSING TABLE BUTTONING HER SACQUE SHE WAS SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY THE EXPRESSION ON HER COMPANION'S FACE PRISCILLA HAD TAKEN UP HER MUFF AND WAS STROKING THE WHITE FUR HER EYES DOWNCAST UPON HER HAND AS IT MOVED TO AND FRO THE RING UPON ITS FOREFINGER SHINING IN THE GASLIGHT
4160-11550-0027 THAT HER PRONOUN WAS ALMOST AN INTERJECTION I THOUGHT PERHAPS SAID PRISCILLA QUIETLY THAT A MESSAGE FROM YOU WOULD GRATIFY HIM IF YOU HAD ONE TO SEND THEO TOOK UP HER GLOVES AND BEGAN TO DRAW THEM ON A SUDDEN FEELING OF PAIN OR DISCOMFORT STRIKING HER
4160-11550-0028 IT WAS A FEELING SCARCELY DEFINED ENOUGH TO ALLOW HER TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WAS REAL PAIN OR ONLY DISCOMFORT I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ANY MESSAGE TO SEND SHE REPLIED THANK YOU MISS PRISCILLA SHE TOOK HER MUFF THEN
4160-11550-0030 SHE HAD THAT EVENING RECEIVED A LETTER FROM DENIS HERSELF AND IT HAD SUGGESTED AN IDEA TO HER I HAVE BEEN THINKING THEO SHE SAID THAT WE MIGHT TAKE A RUN OVER THE CHANNEL OURSELVES I HAVE NOT BEEN IN PARIS FOR FOUR YEARS AND I BELIEVE THE CHANGE WOULD DO ME GOOD
4160-11550-0031 THE LAST TIME I VISITED THE SPAS MY HEALTH IMPROVED GREATLY IT WAS JUST LIKE HER LADYSHIP TO BECOME SUDDENLY POSSESSED OF A WHIM AND TO FOLLOW ITS LEAD ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT SHE WAS A WOMAN OF CAPRICES AND HER CAPRICES ALWAYS RULED THE DAY AS THIS ONE DID TO THEO'S GREAT ASTONISHMENT
4160-11550-0033 SO WHEN THEO BROKE INTO EXCLAMATIONS OF PLEASURE AND ASTONISHMENT SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER HER ENTHUSIASM OR HER SURPRISE WHAT SHE SAID YOU LIKE THE IDEA DO YOU
4160-11550-0034 WELL I THINK I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT IT WE COULD GO NEXT WEEK AND I DARE SAY WE COULD REACH VIENNA BEFORE DENIS OGLETHORPE GOES AWAY THEO BECAME SUDDENLY SILENT SHE GAVE VENT TO NO FURTHER EXCLAMATIONS SHE WOULD ALMOST HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GIVE UP THE PLEASURE OF THE JOURNEY AFTER THAT
4160-11550-0036 SHE WAS ACTUALLY GIRLISH AND SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO FANCY THAT MISTER DENIS OGLETHORPE MIGHT IMAGINE THEIR INTENTION TO FOLLOW HIM WAS SOME FAULT OF HERS AND SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE AND NERVOUS ACCORDINGLY SHE HOPED HE WOULD HAVE LEFT VIENNA BEFORE THE LETTER REACHED HIM SHE HOPED HE MIGHT GO AWAY IN SPITE OF IT
4160-11550-0037 SHE HOPED IT MIGHT NEVER REACH HIM AT ALL AND YET IN SPITE OF THIS SHE EXPERIENCED AN ALMOST PASSIONATELY KEEN SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN ON THE DAY BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE LADY THROCKMORTON RECEIVED A LETTER FROM HIM REGRETTING HIS INABILITY TO COMPLY WITH HER REQUEST
4160-11550-0039 WITH AN UNEXPECTED INCONSISTENT FEELING OF WRETCHEDNESS I WOULD HAVE STAYED ANYWHERE TO HAVE SEEN HIM ONLY FOR A MINUTE HE HAD NO NEED TO BE SO READY TO GO AWAY
4160-14187-0000 I WAS BURNING WITH IMPATIENCE TO IMPART MY NEWS TO HIM AND THIS FACT TOGETHER WITH THE GHOSTLY PROCEEDINGS OF POLTON WORKED ME UP TO A STATE OF NERVOUS TENSION THAT RENDERED EITHER REST OR THOUGHT EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE I LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOW AT THE LAMP BELOW GLARING REDLY THROUGH THE FOG
4160-14187-0002 THE VEHICLE DREW NEARER AND AT LENGTH STOPPED OPPOSITE THE HOUSE ON WHICH POLTON SLID DOWN THE STAIRS WITH THE AGILITY OF A HARLEQUIN A FEW MOMENTS LATER I HEARD HIS VOICE ASCENDING FROM THE HALL I DO HOPE SIR YOU'RE NOT MUCH HURT
4160-14187-0003 THOUGH VERY DISREPUTABLE TO LOOK AT JUST CAME A CROPPER IN THE MUD JERVIS HE ADDED AS HE NOTED MY DISMAYED EXPRESSION DINNER AND A CLOTHES BRUSH ARE WHAT I CHIEFLY NEED NEVERTHELESS HE LOOKED VERY PALE AND SHAKEN WHEN HE CAME INTO THE LIGHT ON THE LANDING
4160-14187-0005 A QUEER AFFAIR JERVIS A VERY ODD AFFAIR INDEED I WAS COMING UP FROM THE BOROUGH PICKING MY WAY MIGHTY CAREFULLY ACROSS THE ROAD ON ACCOUNT OF THE GREASY SLIPPERY MUD AND HAD JUST REACHED THE FOOT OF LONDON BRIDGE WHEN I HEARD A HEAVY LORRY COMING DOWN THE SLOPE A GOOD DEAL TOO FAST
4160-14187-0006 THE HORSES CAME STAMPING AND SLIDING STRAIGHT ON TO ME AND BEFORE I COULD WRIGGLE OUT OF THE WAY THE HOOF OF ONE OF THEM SMASHED IN MY HAT THAT WAS A NEW ONE THAT I CAME HOME IN AND HALF STUNNED ME THEN THE NEAR WHEEL STRUCK MY HEAD MAKING A DIRTY LITTLE SCALP WOUND AND PINNED DOWN MY SLEEVE SO THAT I COULDN'T PULL AWAY MY ARM
4160-14187-0008 YOU DON'T THINK IT WAS INTENTIONAL SURELY I SAID NO OF COURSE NOT HE REPLIED BUT WITHOUT MUCH CONVICTION AS IT SEEMED TO ME AND I WAS ABOUT TO PURSUE THE MATTER WHEN POLTON REAPPEARED AND MY FRIEND ABRUPTLY CHANGED THE SUBJECT AFTER DINNER I RECOUNTED MY CONVERSATION WITH WALTER HORNBY
4160-14187-0009 WATCHING MY COLLEAGUE'S FACE WITH SOME EAGERNESS TO SEE WHAT EFFECT THIS NEW INFORMATION WOULD PRODUCE ON HIM THE RESULT WAS ON THE WHOLE DISAPPOINTING HE WAS INTERESTED KEENLY INTERESTED BUT SHOWED NO SYMPTOMS OF EXCITEMENT
4160-14187-0011 IN WHICH CASE THE DEPRECIATION WOULD NOT HAVE AFFECTED HIM IN THE SAME WAY IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN IT MIGHT HAVE A CONSIDERABLE BEARING ON THE PRESENT CASE MIGHT IT NOT UNDOUBTEDLY SAID THORNDYKE IT MIGHT BEAR ON THE CASE IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE
4160-14187-0012 THAT IS WELL CONSIDERED SAID MY COLLEAGUE BUT WHAT IS THE SPECIAL BEARING ON THE CASE SUPPOSING IT WAS SO ON THE SUPPOSITION I REPLIED THAT MISTER HORNBY WAS IN ACTUAL PECUNIARY DIFFICULTIES AT THE DATE OF THE ROBBERY IT SEEMS TO ME POSSIBLE TO CONSTRUCT A HYPOTHESIS
4160-14187-0014 AND I WAS GRATIFIED TO OBSERVE THE CLOSE ATTENTION WITH WHICH THORNDYKE LISTENED AND HIS LITTLE NODS OF APPROVAL AT EACH POINT THAT I MADE WHEN I HAD FINISHED HE REMAINED SILENT FOR SOME TIME LOOKING THOUGHTFULLY INTO THE FIRE AND EVIDENTLY CONSIDERING HOW MY THEORY AND THE NEW FACTS ON WHICH IT WAS BASED
4160-14187-0015 REALLY ADDS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT FOR THE DULLEST MIND CAN PERCEIVE THE OBVIOUS AS FOR INSTANCE THE IMPORTANCE OF A FINGER PRINT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE A GREAT THING AND I CONGRATULATE YOU FOR YOU HAVE EMANCIPATED YOURSELF AT LEAST TO SOME EXTENT
4160-14187-0017 WHICH HAS BEEN FASTENED UPON EAGERLY BY THE POLICE WHO HAVE NATURALLY BEEN DELIGHTED AT OBTAINING A SORT OF MAGIC TOUCHSTONE BY WHICH THEY ARE SAVED THE LABOUR OF INVESTIGATION BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A SINGLE FACT THAT AFFORDS EVIDENCE REQUIRING NO CORROBORATION
4160-14187-0018 AS WELL MIGHT ONE EXPECT TO MAKE A SYLLOGISM WITH A SINGLE PREMISE I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD HARDLY GO SO FAR AS THAT I SAID LAUGHING NO HE ADMITTED BUT THE KIND OF SYLLOGISM THAT THEY DO MAKE IS THIS THE CRIME WAS COMMITTED BY THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS FINGER PRINT
4160-14187-0020 THE FINGER PRINT IS A MOST VALUABLE CLUE AS LONG AS ITS EVIDENTIAL VALUE IS NOT EXAGGERATED TAKE OUR PRESENT CASE FOR INSTANCE WITHOUT THE THUMB PRINT THE ROBBERY MIGHT HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY ANYBODY THERE IS NO CLUE WHATEVER
4160-14187-0021 QUITE REPLIED THORNDYKE I HAVE ENTERTAINED IT FROM THE FIRST AND THE NEW FACTS THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED INCREASE ITS PROBABILITY YOU REMEMBER I SAID THAT FOUR HYPOTHESES WERE POSSIBLE THAT THE ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED EITHER BY REUBEN BY WALTER BY JOHN HORNBY OR BY SOME OTHER PERSON
4160-14187-0023 SINCE HE ADMITTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS WHEREAS THERE IS NOTHING TO SHOW THAT THE OTHERS HAD THE THUMB PRINT HOWEVER TRANSFERS THE SUSPICION TO REUBEN BUT YET AS YOUR THEORY MAKES EVIDENT IT DOES NOT COMPLETELY CLEAR JOHN HORNBY
4160-14187-0024 AS THE CASE STANDS THE BALANCE OF PROBABILITIES MAY BE STATED THUS JOHN HORNBY UNDOUBTEDLY HAD ACCESS TO THE DIAMONDS AND THEREFORE MIGHT HAVE STOLEN THEM BUT IF THE THUMB MARK WAS MADE AFTER HE CLOSED THE SAFE AND BEFORE HE OPENED IT AGAIN
4160-14187-0026 AS TO WALTER HORNBY HE MAY HAVE HAD THE MEANS OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK BUT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT HE HAD ACCESS EITHER TO THE DIAMONDS OR TO MISTER HORNBY'S MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4160-14187-0027 THE ACTUAL POINTS AT ISSUE THEN I SAID ARE WHETHER REUBEN HAD ANY MEANS OF OPENING THE SAFE AND WHETHER MISTER HORNBY EVER DID ACTUALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF OBTAINING REUBEN'S THUMB MARK IN BLOOD ON HIS MEMORANDUM BLOCK
4195-17507-0000 AND SHINY TOP BOOTS HIS LONG LEGS ENABLED HIM TO OUTSTRIP THE OTHERS AND IN AN ALMOST BREATHLESS VOICE HE BEGGED UNCLE JOHN TO CHOOSE HIS CARRIAGE THE BESTA CARROZZA INA TOWN WE DON'T WANT TO RIDE WAS THE ANSWER THE CABMAN IMPLORED
4195-17507-0001 CERTAINLY THEY MUST MAKE THE AMALFI DRIVE
4195-17507-0003 AH BUT THE AMALFI ROAD SIGNORE SURELY YOU WILL SEE THAT
4195-17507-0004 TO MORROW SIGNORE IT IS GOOD AT WHAT HOUR TO MORROW ILLUSTRISSIMO OH DON'T BOTHER ME WE MAY AS WELL DRIVE TO AMALFI TO MORROW SUGGESTED BETH IT IS THE PROPER THING TO DO UNCLE ALL RIGHT WE'LL GO THEN YOU TAKE MY CARROZZA SIGNORE
4195-17507-0006 IT HAD BEAUTIFUL CAREFULLY BRUSHED CUSHIONS IT WAS DRAWN BY A PAIR OF SPLENDID LOOKING HORSES IS NOT BELLISSIMA SIGNORE ASKED THE MAN PROUDLY
4195-17507-0007 BE READY TO START AT NINE O'CLOCK TO MORROW MORNING THE MAN PROMISED WHEREAT HIS CONFRERES LOST ALL INTEREST IN THE MATTER AND THE STRANGERS WERE ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITHOUT FURTHER INTERRUPTION THEY FOUND OUT ALL ABOUT THE AMALFI DRIVE THAT EVENING AND WERE GLAD INDEED THEY HAD DECIDED TO GO
4195-17507-0009 I MUST NOT RUIN A NICE DRESS WHEN I WORK ANSWERED THE MAN SMILING UNABASHED BUT THE CARRIAGE WHAT HAS BECOME OF THE FINE CARRIAGE AND THE GOOD HORSES SIR AH IT IS DREADFUL IT IS HORRIBLE SIGNORE
4195-17507-0010 IT DO NOT REMAIN GOOD FOR A LONG RIDE SO I LEAVE HIM HOME FOR I AM KIND I DO NOT WISH THE SIGNORINI BELLA TO TIRE AND WEEP BUT SEE THE FINE VETTURE YOU NOW HAVE IS HE NOT EASY LIKE FEATHERS AN STRONG
4195-17507-0012 HOP IN MY DEARS THEY ENTERED THE CRAZY LOOKING VEHICLE AND FOUND THE SEATS AMPLE AND COMFORTABLE DESPITE THE APPEARANCE OF DILAPIDATION EVERYWHERE PREVALENT THE DRIVER MOUNTED THE BOX CRACKED HIS WHIP AND THE LEAN NAGS AMBLED AWAY AT A FAIR PACE
4195-17507-0013 IT WAS STANDING JUST AS IT HAD BEFORE AND BESIDE IT WAS ANOTHER MAN DRESSED IN THE SPLENDID UNIFORM HIS DRIVER HAD CLAIMED THAT HE HAD LEFT AT HOME
4195-17507-0015 THIS RIG IS ALL RIGHT UNCLE IT MAY NOT BE AS PRETTY AS THE OTHER BUT I EXPECT THAT ONE IS ONLY KEPT TO MAKE ENGAGEMENTS WITH WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUAL USE WE DON'T GET IT THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH HE RETURNED
4195-17507-0016 INDEED THE SUN DID COME OUT BUT ONLY TO GIVE A DISCOURAGED LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE AND RETIRE AGAIN
4195-17507-0018 WHEN THE CLIMATE IS LITTLE BETTER THAN THAT PREVAILING IN THE EASTERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES AND PERHAPS ONE SUFFERS MORE IN ITALY THAN IN AMERICA OWING TO THE GENERAL LACK OF MEANS TO KEEP WARM ON COLD DAYS THE ITALIAN
4195-17507-0019 FOR HE WILL PERMIT NO REPROACH TO LIE ON HIS BELOVED LAND BUT THE TRAVELLER FREQUENTLY BECOMES DISCOURAGED AND THE AMERICAN CONTINGENT ESPECIALLY
4195-17507-0021 ITALY IS BEAUTIFUL IT IS CHARMING AND DELIGHTFUL BUT SELDOM IS THIS TRUE IN WINTER OR EARLY SPRING THE HORSES WENT ALONG AT A SPANKING PACE THAT WAS ASTONISHING THEY PASSED THROUGH THE PICTURESQUE LANES OF SORRENTO CLIMBED
4195-17507-0022 THE FURTHER SLOPE AND BROUGHT THE CARRIAGE TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PENINSULA WHERE THE GIRLS OBTAINED THEIR FIRST VIEW OF THE GULF OF SALERNO WITH THE LOVELY ISLES OF THE SIRENS LYING JUST BENEATH THEM
4195-17507-0024 RISING STRAIGHT FROM THE SEA WHICH THE HIGHWAY OVERHANGS AT AN AVERAGE HEIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED FEET THE TRAVELLER BEING PROTECTED ONLY BY A LOW STONE PARAPET FROM THE VAST GULF THAT YAWNS BENEATH
4195-17507-0025 AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD THE CLIFFS CONTINUE TO ASCEND A LIKE DISTANCE TOWARD THE SKY
4195-17507-0027 FROM THAT DISTANCE THE BOATS DRAWN UPON THE SHELTERED BEACH SEEMED LIKE MERE TOYS THEN THEY WOULD SPAN A CHASM ON A NARROW STONE BRIDGE OR PLUNGE THROUGH AN ARCH DIVIDING THE SOLID MOUNTAIN
4195-17507-0028 WHEN THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE DAY OVERTOOK THEM WITHOUT WARNING THE WIND CAME WHISTLING AROUND THEM IN A GREAT GALE WHICH SPEEDILY INCREASED IN FURY UNTIL IT DROVE THE BLINDED HORSES REELING AGAINST THE LOW PARAPET
4195-17507-0030 AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT A MOUNTED HORSEMAN WHO UNOBSERVED HAD BEEN FOLLOWING THE PARTY DASHED TO THEIR RESCUE THE RIDER CAUGHT THE PLUNGING STEEDS BY THEIR HEADS AND TRIED TO RESTRAIN THEIR TERROR AT HIS OWN EMINENT PERIL
4195-17507-0031 WHILE THE CARRIAGE LAY WEDGED AGAINST THE WALL AND THE DRIVER SCREAMED PITIFULLY FROM HIS DANGEROUS POSITION MIDWAY BETWEEN SEA AND SKY
4195-17507-0033 THE HORSES AS SOON AS THE STRAIN UPON THEIR BITS WAS RELAXED WERE EASILY QUIETED
4195-17507-0034 THE ADVENTURE WAS ACCOMPLISHED THE PERIL WAS PAST AND ALL WAS WELL AGAIN UNCLE JOHN LEAPED FROM THE CARRIAGE FOLLOWED BY LOUISE AND PATSY
4195-17507-0036 HE WAS SITTING UPON HIS HORSE AND STARING WITH AMAZEMENT AT BETH
4195-17507-0037 BY EVERY SAINT IN THE CALENDAR THAT THE GIRL HAD SAVED HIM FROM A FRIGHTFUL DEATH AND HE WOULD DEVOTE HIS FUTURE LIFE TO HER SERVICE IT IS WONDERFUL MURMURED FERRALTI
4195-17507-0039 WE'D BETTER GET BACK TO SORRENTO SAID UNCLE JOHN ABRUPTLY
4195-17507-0040 THAT IS IF YOU PERMIT ME TO ACCOMPANY YOU
4195-17507-0042 THE WIND HAD SUBSIDED AS SUDDENLY AS IT HAD ARISEN AND AS THEY PASSED THROUGH POSITANO WHICH IS FOUR HUNDRED FEET HIGH
4195-17507-0043 COUNT FERRALTI RODE AT THE SIDE OF THE CARRIAGE BUT DID NOT ATTEMPT MUCH CONVERSATION
4195-17507-0045 WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN THE YEAR TWELVE TWELVE FROM THE ARBORED VERANDA OF THIS CHARMING RETREAT IS OBTAINED ONE OF THE FINEST VIEWS IN EUROPE AND WHILE THE GIRLS SAT ENJOYING IT UNCLE JOHN ARRANGED WITH A PLEASANT FACED WOMAN
4195-17507-0046 WHO HAD ONCE LIVED IN AMERICA FOR THEIR LUNCHEON AN HOUR LATER AND JUST AS THEY WERE SITTING DOWN TO THE MEAL COUNT FERRALTI REJOINED THEM
4195-17507-0048 AND BETH MOUNTED THE BOX AND RODE BESIDE HER FRIEND THE DRIVER
4195-186236-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE PATSY ADOPTS AN UNCLE UNCLE JOHN AND MISTER WATSON DID NOT APPEAR AT DINNER BEING CLOSETED IN THE FORMER'S ROOM
4195-186236-0002 BUT THERE WERE FEW TEARS SHED FOR JANE MERRICK AND THE NEW REGIME COULD NOT FAIL TO BE AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE LAST
4195-186236-0003 BUT BEING UNAWARE OF ITS IMPORT GAVE IT BUT PASSING ATTENTION THE MAIN SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION WAS AUNT JANE'S SURPRISING ACT IN ANNULLING HER LAST WILL AND FORCING PATRICIA TO ACCEPT THE INHERITANCE WHEN SHE DID NOT WANT IT
4195-186236-0005 LOUISE AND BETH HAVING AT LAST FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR COUSIN'S DESIRE TO INCREASE THEIR BEQUESTS WERE OPENLY VERY GRATEFUL FOR HER GOOD WILL ALTHOUGH SECRETLY THEY COULD NOT FAIL TO RESENT PATSY'S CHOICE OF THE BOY AS THE PROPER HEIR OF HIS UNCLE'S FORTUNE
4195-186236-0006 THE BALANCE OF POWER SEEMED TO BE IN PATRICIA'S HANDS HOWEVER
4195-186236-0008 AND THEN SHE WENT TO BED AND SLEPT PEACEFULLY
4195-186236-0009 LAWYER WATSON AND UNCLE JOHN WERE THERE LOOKING AS GRAVE AS THE IMPORTANT OCCASION DEMANDED
4195-186236-0011 WAS MADE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ONE UNDER WHICH JANE MERRICK INHERITED AND THEREFORE SUPERCEDES IT
4195-186236-0012 OF THE ESTATE DURING HER LIFETIME

4267-78186-0004 SO I SAID TO HIM ONE DAY MINISTER SAID I HOW ON AIRTH DO YOU MANAGE TO KEEP YOUR FRUIT THAT'S SO EXPOSED WHEN NO ONE ELSE CAN'T DO IT NOHOW WHY SAYS HE THEY ARE DREADFULLY PRETTY FRUIT AIN'T THEY
4267-78186-0005 THAT ARE OUTWARD ROW I GRAFTED MYSELF WITH THE CHOICEST KIND I COULD FIND AND I SUCCEEDED THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL BUT SO ETARNAL SOUR NO HUMAN SOUL CAN EAT THEM WELL
4267-78186-0007 IF PUGWASH HAD A WATERY MOUTH WHEN HE MARRIED I GUESS IT'S PRETTY PUCKERY BY THIS TIME HOWEVER IF SHE GOES TO ACT UGLY
4267-78186-0008 I'LL GIVE HER A DOSE OF SOFT SAWDER THAT WILL TAKE THE FROWN OUT OF HER FRONTISPIECE AND MAKE HER DIAL PLATE AS SMOOTH AS A LICK OF COPAL VARNISH IT'S A PITY SHE'S SUCH A KICKIN DEVIL TOO FOR SHE HAS GOOD POINTS GOOD EYE GOOD FOOT
4267-78186-0010 AND ON OPENING THE OPPOSITE DOOR INTO THE SITTING ROOM WE FOUND THE FEMALE PART OF THE FAMILY EXTINGUISHING THE FIRE FOR THE NIGHT MISSUS PUGWASH HAD A BROOM IN HER HAND AND WAS IN THE ACT THE LAST ACT OF FEMALE HOUSEWIFERY OF SWEEPING THE HEARTH
4267-78186-0011 THE STRONG FLICKERING LIGHT OF THE FIRE AS IT FELL UPON HER TALL FINE FIGURE AND BEAUTIFUL FACE REVEALED A CREATURE WORTHY OF THE CLOCKMAKER'S COMMENTS GOOD EVENING MARM SAID MISTER SLICK HOW DO YOU DO
4267-78186-0013 AND I AM SORRY TO HAVE DISTURBED YOU BUT WE GOT DETAINED LONGER THAN WE EXPECTED I AM SORRY THAT SO AM I SAID SHE BUT IF MISTER PUGWASH WILL KEEP AN INN WHEN HE HAS NO OCCASION TO HIS FAMILY CAN'T EXPECT NO REST
4267-78186-0014 HERE THE CLOCKMAKER SEEING THE STORM GATHERING STOOPED DOWN SUDDENLY AND STARING INTENTLY HELD OUT HIS HAND AND EXCLAIMED WELL IF THAT AIN'T A BEAUTIFUL CHILD COME HERE MY LITTLE MAN
4267-78186-0016 WELL I WISH MY OLD MOTHER COULD SEE THAT CHILD IT IS SUCH A TREAT IN OUR COUNTRY SAID HE TURNING TO ME THE CHILDREN ARE ALL AS PALE AS CHALK OR AS YALLER AS AN ORANGE LORD
4267-78186-0017 THAT ARE LITTLE FELLER WOULD BE A SHOW IN OUR COUNTRY COME TO ME MY MAN HERE THE SOFT SAWDER BEGAN TO OPERATE MISSUS PUGWASH SAID IN A MILDER TONE THAN WE HAD YET HEARD GO MY DEAR TO THE GENTLEMAN

4267-78186-0020 AGAIN ADDRESSING ME SUCH A LIKENESS BETWEEN ONE HUMAN AND ANOTHER AS BETWEEN THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY AND HIS MOTHER I AM SURE YOU HAVE HAD NO SUPPER SAID MISSUS PUGWASH TO ME YOU MUST BE HUNGRY AND WEARY TOO
4267-78186-0022 WHERE THE FIRE WAS NOW BLAZING UP BUT MISTER SLICK PROTESTED HE COULD NOT PROCEED WITHOUT THE LITTLE BOY AND LINGERED BEHIND TO ASCERTAIN HIS AGE AND CONCLUDED BY ASKING THE CHILD IF HE HAD ANY AUNTS THAT LOOKED LIKE MAMA
4267-78186-0023 AS THE DOOR CLOSED MISTER SLICK SAID IT'S A PITY SHE DON'T GO WELL IN GEAR THE DIFFICULTY WITH THOSE CRITTERS IS TO GIT THEM TO START ARTER THAT THERE IS NO TROUBLE WITH THEM IF YOU DON'T CHECK EM TOO SHORT IF YOU DO THEY'LL STOP AGAIN
4267-78186-0025 I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WITH THESE WOMEN FOLK FOR I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE ROAD TO A WOMAN'S HEART LIES THROUGH HER CHILD YOU SEEM SAID I TO UNDERSTAND THE FEMALE HEART SO WELL I MAKE NO DOUBT YOU ARE A GENERAL FAVORITE AMONG THE FAIR SEX
4267-78186-0026 ANY MAN HE REPLIED THAT UNDERSTANDS HORSES HAS A PRETTY CONSIDERABLE FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF WOMEN FOR THEY ARE JIST ALIKE IN TEMPER AND REQUIRE THE VERY IDENTICAL SAME TREATMENT ENCOURAGE THE TIMID ONES
4267-78186-0028 THE FEMALE HEART AS FAR AS MY EXPERIENCE GOES IS JIST LIKE A NEW INDIA RUBBER SHOE YOU MAY PULL AND PULL AT IT TILL IT STRETCHES OUT A YARD LONG
4267-78186-0029 THEIR HEARTS ARE MADE OF STOUT LEATHER I TELL YOU
4267-78186-0031 AND AS STRONG AS A TOW BOAT I GUESS HE WAS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN A FOOT LONGER THAN THE MORAL LAW AND CATECHISM TOO HE WAS A PERFECT PICTUR OF A MAN YOU COULDN'T FAULT HIM IN NO PARTICULAR HE WAS SO JUST A MADE CRITTER
4267-78186-0032 WHEN THEY ALL CAME OUT TOGETHER AN AMAZIN HANDSOM SIGHT TOO NEAR ABOUT A WHOLE CONGREGATION OF YOUNG GALS BANKS USED TO SAY I VOW YOUNG LADIES I WISH I HAD FIVE HUNDRED ARMS TO RECIPROCATE ONE WITH EACH OF YOU
4267-78186-0034 ALL AT THE SAME TIME AND THEIR DEAR LITTLE EYES SPARKLIN LIKE SO MANY STARS TWINKLIN OF A FROSTY NIGHT WELL WHEN I LAST SEED HIM HE WAS ALL SKIN AND BONE LIKE A HORSE TURNED OUT TO DIE HE WAS TEETOTALLY DEFLESHED
4267-78186-0035 A MERE WALKIN SKELETON I AM DREADFUL SORRY SAYS I TO SEE YOU BANKS LOOKIN SO PEAKED WHY YOU LOOK LIKE A SICK TURKEY HEN ALL LEGS WHAT ON AIRTH AILS YOU I'M DYIN SAYS HE
4267-78186-0037 THE FORE PART OF THE SUMMER WITH LEFTENANT OBY KNOWLES THAT I COULD SHOULDER THE BEST BOWER OF THE CONSTITUTION FRIGATE I WON MY BET BUT THE ANCHOR WAS SO ETARNAL HEAVY THAT IT BROKE MY HEART
4267-287369-0000 RATHER ODD COMMENTED MISTER JENKS BLACK PAPER AND WHITE INK WHITE INK IS EASY ENOUGH TO MAKE STATED MISTER PARKER
4267-287369-0002 TOGETHER WITH THE ANTICS OF THE THING IN WHITE LAST NIGHT SHOWS THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF OUR PRESENCE HERE AND PERHAPS KNOW WHO WE ARE WE WILL HAVE TO BE ON OUR GUARD DO YOU THINK THAT FELLOW MUNSON
4267-287369-0003 WHOM WE LEFT IN THE FOREST COULD HAVE GOTTEN HERE AND WARNED THEM ASKED MISTER DAMON IT'S POSSIBLE ADMITTED TOM BUT NOW LET'S SEE IF THE PERSON WHO PINNED THIS WARNING ON OUR TENT TOOK ANY OF OUR THINGS
4267-287369-0005 EVERYONE TALKING DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE MEAL ABOUT THE EVENTS OF THE DAY AND THE RATHER WEIRD CULMINATION OF IT WELL WE HAVEN'T HAD A GREAT DEAL OF SUCCESS SO FAR ADMITTED TOM
4267-287369-0006 GOOD IDEA COMMENTED MISTER JENKS WE'LL DO IT AND MOVE OUR CAMP I ONLY HOPE THOSE FELLOWS DON'T FIND OUR AIRSHIP AND DESTROY IT WE'LL HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION AGAIN
4267-287369-0008 THAT HAD BEEN BUILT ONLY AFTER HARD LABOR BUT HE KNEW HE COULD ACCOMPLISH NOTHING BY WORRYING AND HE TRIED TO DISMISS THE MATTER FROM HIS MIND
4267-287369-0009 THEY RATHER EXPECTED TO SEE THE THING IN WHITE AGAIN THAT NIGHT BUT IT DID NOT APPEAR AND MORNING CAME WITHOUT ANYTHING HAVING DISTURBED THEIR HEAVY SLEEP FOR THEY WERE TIRED FROM THE DAY'S TRAMP
4267-287369-0011 MISTER PARKER HE ASKED AS HE SAW THE SCIENTIST TRAMPING A LITTLE WAY UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN I AM GOING TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS WAS THE ANSWER AND NO ONE PAID ANY MORE ATTENTION TO HIM FOR SOME TIME
4267-287369-0012 SUPPER WAS NEARLY READY WHEN MISTER PARKER RETURNED HIS FACE WORE A RATHER SERIOUS AIR AND MISTER DAMON NOTING IT ASKED LAUGHINGLY WELL
4267-287369-0014 FROM A HIGH PEAK I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF ONE WORKING THIS WAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS THEN WE'D BETTER FASTEN THE TENT WELL DOWN CALLED TOM WE DON'T WANT IT TO BLOW AWAY
4267-287369-0015 WAS MISTER PARKER'S OPINION FROM WHAT THEN ASKED MISTER JENKS FROM THE DISCHARGES OF LIGHTNING AMONG THESE MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHICH CONTAIN SO MUCH IRON ORE
4267-287369-0017 AS THE IRON ORE EXTENDS FOR MILES WE CAN NOT GET OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE BEFORE THE STORM WILL REACH US IT WILL BE HERE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THEN WE'D BETTER HAVE SUPPER REMARKED TOM PRACTICALLY
4267-287369-0018 AND GET READY FOR IT PERHAPS IT MAY NOT BE AS BAD AS MISTER PARKER FEARS IT WILL BE BAD ENOUGH DECLARED THE GLOOMY SCIENTIST AND HE SEEMED TO FIND PLEASURE IN HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
4267-287369-0020 FITFUL FLASHES OF LIGHTNING COULD BE SEEN FORKING ACROSS THE SKY IN JAGGED CHAINS OF PURPLE LIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE A HEAVY STORM TOM ADMITTED TO HIMSELF
4267-287369-0021 I HOPE LIGHTNING DOESN'T STRIKE AROUND HERE THE STORM CAME ON RAPIDLY BUT THERE WAS A CURIOUS QUIETNESS IN THE AIR THAT WAS MORE ALARMING THAN IF A WIND HAD BLOWN THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY
4267-287369-0023 IT WAS BLACKER THAN EVER SUDDENLY AS TOM WAS GAZING UP TOWARD THE PEAK OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HE SAW SOMETHING THAT CAUSED HIM TO CRY OUT IN ALARM HE POINTED UPWARD AND WHISPERED HOARSELY
4267-287369-0024 THEY MUST HAVE FOLLOWED US SAID MISTER JENKS IN A LOW VOICE SLOWLY THE FIGURE ADVANCED IT WAVED THE LONG WHITE ARMS AS IF IN WARNING
4267-287369-0026 HAD BEEN GROWING LOUDER AND SHARPER INDICATING THE NEARER APPROACH OF THE STORM EACH LIGHTNING FLASH WAS FOLLOWED IN A SECOND OR TWO BY A TERRIFIC CLAP STILL THERE WAS NO WIND NOR RAIN
4267-287369-0027 AND THE CAMPFIRE BURNED STEADILY ALL AT ONCE THERE WAS A CRASH AS IF THE VERY MOUNTAIN HAD SPLIT ASUNDER AND THE ADVENTURERS SAW A GREAT BALL OF PURPLE BLUISH FIRE SHOOT DOWN
4267-287369-0029 SHOUTING SO AS TO BE HEARD ABOVE THE ECHOES OF THE THUNDERCLAP ALMOST AS HE SPOKE THERE CAME ANOTHER EXPLOSION EVEN LOUDER THAN THE ONE PRECEDING A GREAT BALL OF FIRE PEAR SHAPED
4267-287369-0030 LEAPED FOR THE SAME SPOT IN THE MOUNTAIN THERE'S A MASS OF IRON ORE THERE YELLED MISTER PARKER THE LIGHTNING IS ATTRACTED TO IT HIS VOICE WAS SWALLOWED UP IN THE TERRIFIC CRASH THAT FOLLOWED
4267-287369-0032 IN ANOTHER INSTANT IT LOOKED AS IF THE WHOLE PLACE ABOUT WHERE THE DIAMOND SEEKERS STOOD WAS A MASS OF FIRE GREAT FORKED TONGUES OF LIGHTNING LEAPED FROM THE CLOUDS AND SEEMED TO LICK THE GROUND
4267-287369-0033 AND THERE WAS A STRONG SMELL OF SULPHUR IN THE AIR WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF THE STORM CRIED MISTER PARKER WE ARE STANDING ON A MASS OF IRON ORE ANY MINUTE MAY BE OUR LAST
4267-287369-0035 THEY STOOD STILL AWED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO THEN ONCE MORE CAME A TERRIFIC CLAP A GREAT MASS OF FIRE LIKE SOME RED HOT INGOT FROM A FOUNDRY
4267-287369-0036 WAS HURLED THROUGH THE AIR STRAIGHT AT THE FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND AT THE SPOT WHERE THE FIGURE IN WHITE HAD STOOD BUT A FEW MINUTES BEFORE INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AS IT HAD AT EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
4297-13006-0000 NEITHER AT DINNER ON THAT EVENING AT MANCHESTER SQUARE NOR AFTER DINNER AS LONG AS MISSUS ROBY REMAINED IN THE HOUSE WAS A WORD SAID ABOUT LOPEZ BY MISTER WHARTON HE REMAINED LONGER THAN USUAL WITH HIS BOTTLE OF PORT WINE IN THE DINING ROOM
4297-13006-0001 BUT AS SOON AS MISSUS ROBY WAS GONE AND MISSUS ROBY WENT HOME ROUND THE CORNER SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN MISTER WHARTON WOKE UP INSTANTLY AND MADE INQUIRY OF HIS DAUGHTER
4297-13006-0003 IF HE DID NOT MEAN YOU TO CHOOSE FOR YOURSELF WHY DIDN'T HE KEEP A CLOSER LOOK OUT I HAVEN'T CHOSEN ANY ONE AUNT HARRIET WELL TO SPEAK FAIRLY I THOUGHT YOU HAD AND I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AGAINST YOUR CHOICE
4297-13006-0004 NO DOUBT YOUR PAPA WILL HAVE IT OUT WITH YOU JUST NOW SO YOU HAD BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND WHAT YOU WILL SAY TO HIM IF YOU REALLY LIKE THE MAN I DON'T SEE WHY YOU SHOULDN'T SAY SO AND STICK TO IT HE HAS MADE A REGULAR OFFER AND GIRLS IN THESE DAYS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE THEIR FATHER'S SLAVES
4297-13006-0006 AND THOUGH SHE HAD NOT BECOME LIKE THE MAN SHE HAD BECOME VULGAR SHE WAS NOT AN ELIGIBLE COMPANION FOR MISTER WHARTON'S DAUGHTER A MATTER AS TO WHICH THE FATHER HAD NOT GIVEN HIMSELF PROPER OPPORTUNITIES OF LEARNING THE FACTS AN AUNT IN HIS CLOSE NEIGHBOURHOOD WAS SO GREAT A COMFORT TO HIM
4297-13006-0007 SO READY AND SO NATURAL AN ASSISTANCE TO HIM IN HIS DIFFICULTIES BUT EMILY WHARTON WAS NOT IN THE LEAST LIKE HER AUNT NOR HAD MISSUS WHARTON BEEN AT ALL LIKE MISSUS ROBY NO DOUBT THE CONTACT WAS DANGEROUS
4297-13006-0009 RATHER EXCEEDING THE AVERAGE PROPORTIONS AS WELL AS HEIGHT OF WOMEN HER FEATURES WERE REGULAR AND HANDSOME AND HER FORM WAS PERFECT BUT IT WAS BY HER MANNER AND HER VOICE THAT SHE CONQUERED RATHER THAN BY HER BEAUTY
4297-13006-0010 WHICH STRANGERS DID NOT FIND ON HER FACE BUT AS WE DO NOT LIGHT UP OUR HOUSES WITH OUR BRIGHTEST LAMPS FOR ALL COMERS SO NEITHER DID SHE EMIT FROM HER EYES THEIR BRIGHTEST SPARKS TILL SPECIAL OCCASION FOR SUCH SHINING HAD ARISEN
4297-13006-0012 THE YOUNG MAN MAY BECOME LORD CHANCELLOR OR AT ANY RATE EARN HIS BREAD COMFORTABLY AS A COUNTY COURT JUDGE BUT THE GIRL CAN LOOK FORWARD TO LITTLE ELSE THAN THE CHANCE OF HAVING A GOOD MAN FOR HER HUSBAND A GOOD MAN
4297-13006-0013 OR IF HER TASTES LIE IN THAT DIRECTION A RICH MAN EMILY WHARTON HAD DOUBTLESS THOUGHT ABOUT THESE THINGS AND SHE SINCERELY BELIEVED THAT SHE HAD FOUND THE GOOD MAN IN FERDINAND LOPEZ
4297-13006-0015 AND MISTER WHARTON HAD FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO ABSTAIN FROM ALLUSION TO SUCH MATTERS FROM AN ASSURED FEELING THAT HE COULD NOT IN THAT DIRECTION PLANT AN ENDURING OBJECTION IN THIS WAY LOPEZ HAD CARRIED HIS POINT WITH MISTER WHARTON
4297-13006-0016 AND THIS HE HAD DONE WITHOUT EVER HAVING ASKED FOR HER LOVE AND HE HAD EVEN TAKEN THE TROUBLE TO ALLURE DICK AND HAD LISTENED TO AND HAD TALKED WHOLE PAGES OUT OF BELL'S LIFE ON HIS OWN BEHALF IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED
4297-13006-0018 AND DECLARED AS SHE ALWAYS DID ON SUCH OCCASIONS THAT SHE COULD GO ROUND THE CORNER WITHOUT HAVING ANY ONE TO LOOK AFTER HER
4297-13006-0019 HE CAME TO ME TO DAY AND ASKED FOR MY PERMISSION TO ADDRESS YOU SHE SAT PERFECTLY QUIET STILL LOOKING AT HIM BUT SHE DID NOT SAY A WORD OF COURSE I DID NOT GIVE HIM PERMISSION WHY OF COURSE PAPA
4297-13006-0021 IN THAT CASE I COULD HAVE JUDGED FOR MYSELF I SUPPOSE EVERY GIRL WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE ACCEPTED HIM I THINK I SHOULD HAVE CONSULTED YOU BEFORE I DID THAT BUT I SHOULD HAVE WISHED TO ACCEPT HIM PAPA I DO LOVE HIM
4297-13006-0022 I HAVE NEVER SAID SO BEFORE TO ANY ONE I WOULD NOT SAY SO TO YOU NOW IF HE HAD NOT SPOKEN TO YOU AS HE HAS DONE EMILY IT MUST NOT BE WHY NOT PAPA IF YOU SAY IT SHALL NOT BE SO IT SHALL NOT
4297-13006-0024 HE IS A FOREIGNER BUT IS HE AND WHY SHOULD NOT A FOREIGNER BE AS GOOD AS AN ENGLISHMAN HIS NAME IS FOREIGN BUT HE TALKS ENGLISH AND LIVES AS AN ENGLISHMAN HE HAS NO RELATIVES NO FAMILY NO BELONGINGS
4297-13006-0025 HE IS WHAT WE CALL AN ADVENTURER MARRIAGE MY DEAR IS A MOST SERIOUS THING YES PAPA I KNOW THAT ONE IS BOUND TO BE VERY CAREFUL HOW CAN I GIVE YOU TO A MAN I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT AN ADVENTURER
4297-13006-0027 DISREPUTABLE YOU MAY SAY THAT OF ANY MAN PAPA BUT WHEN A MAN HAS CONNEXIONS A FATHER AND MOTHER OR UNCLES AND AUNTS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THEN THERE IS SOME GUARANTEE OF SECURITY
4297-13006-0028 DID YOU EVER HEAR THIS MAN SPEAK OF HIS FATHER I DON'T KNOW THAT I EVER DID OR HIS MOTHER OR HIS FAMILY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IS SUSPICIOUS
4297-13006-0030 NOR SPOKEN TO HIM OF YOUR REGARD FOR HIM NEVER NOT A WORD NOR HE TO ME EXCEPT IN SUCH WORDS AS ONE UNDERSTANDS EVEN THOUGH THEY SAY NOTHING I WISH HE HAD NEVER SEEN YOU IS HE A BAD MAN PAPA
4297-13006-0031 PAPA I WISH YOU KNEW HIM BETTER THAN YOU DO I DO NOT WANT TO KNOW HIM BETTER IS NOT THAT PREJUDICE PAPA MY DEAR EMILY SAID MISTER WHARTON STRIVING TO WAX INTO ANGER
4297-13006-0033 AND YOU OUGHT TO FEEL THAT AS I HAVE HAD A LONG EXPERIENCE IN THE WORLD MY JUDGMENT ABOUT A YOUNG MAN MIGHT BE TRUSTED THAT WAS A STATEMENT WHICH MISS WHARTON WAS NOT PREPARED TO ADMIT
4297-13006-0034 SHE HAD ALREADY PROFESSED HERSELF WILLING TO SUBMIT TO HER FATHER'S JUDGMENT AND DID NOT NOW BY ANY MEANS CONTEMPLATE REBELLION AGAINST PARENTAL AUTHORITY BUT SHE DID FEEL THAT ON A MATTER SO VITAL TO HER
4297-13006-0036 ALREADY PRONOUNCED YOU KNOW PAPA THAT I TRUST YOU SHE SAID AND I HAVE PROMISED YOU THAT I WILL NOT DISOBEY YOU
4297-13006-0037 YOU ARE A GOOD GIRL YOU WERE ALWAYS A GOOD GIRL BUT I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT TO HEAR ME THEN HE STOOD STILL WITH HIS HANDS IN HIS TROWSERS POCKETS LOOKING AT HER
4297-13006-0039 IF IT IS ONLY BECAUSE MISTER LOPEZ HAS A FOREIGN NAME IT ISN'T ONLY THAT NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT HIM OR WHERE TO INQUIRE EVEN I THINK YOU SHOULD INQUIRE PAPA AND BE QUITE CERTAIN BEFORE YOU PRONOUNCE SUCH A SENTENCE AGAINST ME
4297-13006-0040 IT WILL BE A CRUSHING BLOW HE LOOKED AT HER AND SAW THAT THERE WAS A FIXED PURPOSE IN HER COUNTENANCE OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER BEFORE SEEN SIMILAR SIGNS YOU CLAIM A RIGHT TO MY OBEDIENCE AND I ACKNOWLEDGE IT
4297-13006-0042 I WILL OF COURSE I WILL AND HE BEGAN THE PROCESS OF THINKING ABOUT IT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE DOOR WAS CLOSED BEHIND HER BUT WHAT WAS THERE TO THINK ABOUT NOTHING THAT SHE HAD SAID ALTERED IN THE LEAST HIS IDEA ABOUT THE MAN
4297-13006-0043 HE WAS AS CONVINCED AS EVER THAT UNLESS THERE WAS MUCH TO CONCEAL THERE WOULD NOT BE SO MUCH CONCEALMENT BUT A FEELING BEGAN TO GROW UPON HIM ALREADY THAT HIS DAUGHTER HAD A MODE OF PLEADING WITH HIM WHICH HE WOULD NOT ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO RESIST
4297-13009-0000 THEY WERE HABITUALLY INDIFFERENT TO SELF EXALTATION AND ALLOWED THEMSELVES TO BE THRUST INTO THIS OR THAT UNFITTING ROLE PROFESSING THAT THE QUEEN'S GOVERNMENT AND THE GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WERE THEIR ONLY CONSIDERATIONS
4297-13009-0001 BECAUSE IT WAS FELT ON ALL SIDES THAT SIR ORLANDO COULD NOT JOIN THE NEW COMPOSITE PARTY WITHOUT HIGH PLACE AND THE SAME GRACE WAS SHOWN IN REGARD TO LORD DRUMMOND WHO REMAINED AT THE COLONIES KEEPING THE OFFICE TO WHICH HE HAD BEEN LATELY TRANSFERRED UNDER MISTER DAUBENY
4297-13009-0003 AND A BEGINNING OF EASE SIR GREGORY WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN AND THIS WAS A TERRIBLE BLOW BUT HE BORE IT MANFULLY SAYING NOT A WORD WHEN THE DUKE SPOKE TO HIM BUT HE BECAME CONVINCED FROM THAT MOMENT THAT NO MORE INEFFICIENT LAWYER EVER SAT UPON THE ENGLISH BENCH
4297-13009-0004 OR A MORE PRESUMPTUOUS POLITICIAN IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT THAN LORD RAMSDEN THE REAL STRUGGLE HOWEVER LAY IN THE APPROPRIATE DISTRIBUTION OF THE RATTLERS AND THE ROBYS THE FITZGIBBONS AND THE MACPHERSONS AMONG THE SUBORDINATE OFFICES OF STATE
4297-13009-0006 AT THE FIRST BLUSH OF THE MATTER THE ARRANGEMENT TOOK THE FORM OF A GRACIOUS TENDER FROM THEMSELVES TO A STATESMAN CALLED UPON TO ACT IN VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY WERE THANKED ACCORDINGLY BY THE DUKE WITH SOMETHING OF REAL CORDIAL GRATITUDE
4297-13009-0007 HE WAS ASTOUNDED NOT SO MUCH BY THE PRETENSIONS AS BY THE UNBLUSHING ASSERTION OF THESE PRETENSIONS IN REFERENCE TO PLACES WHICH HE HAD BEEN INNOCENT ENOUGH TO THINK WERE ALWAYS BESTOWED AT ANY RATE WITHOUT DIRECT APPLICATION HE HAD MEASURED HIMSELF RIGHTLY WHEN HE TOLD THE OLDER DUKE
4297-13009-0009 ONE ON THE HEELS OF THE OTHER EACH ASSURING ME NOT ONLY THAT THE WHOLE STABILITY OF THE ENTERPRISE DEPENDS ON MY GIVING A CERTAIN OFFICE TO HIM BUT ACTUALLY TELLING ME TO MY FACE THAT I HAD PROMISED IT TO HIM THE OLD STATESMAN LAUGHED
4297-13009-0010 TO BE TOLD WITHIN THE SAME HALF HOUR BY TWO MEN THAT I HAD MADE PROMISES TO EACH OF THEM INCONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER WHO WERE THE TWO MEN MISTER RATTLER AND MISTER ROBY I AM ASSURED THAT THEY ARE INSEPARABLE SINCE THE WORK WAS BEGUN
4297-13009-0012 BUT WHY DO THEY COME TO ME WITH THEIR MOUTHS OPEN LIKE DOGS CRAVING A BONE IT USED NOT TO BE SO OF COURSE MEN WERE ALWAYS ANXIOUS FOR OFFICE AS THEY ARE NOW WELL YES WE'VE HEARD OF THAT BEFORE TO DAY I THINK
4297-13009-0013 BUT I DON'T THINK ANY MAN EVER VENTURED TO ASK MISTER MILDMAY TIME HAD DONE MUCH FOR HIM IN CONSOLIDATING HIS AUTHORITY AND PERHAPS THE PRESENT WORLD IS LESS RETICENT IN ITS EAGERNESS THAN IT WAS IN HIS YOUNGER DAYS I DOUBT HOWEVER
4297-13009-0015 BUT AT LAST EVEN THE RATTLERS AND ROBYS WERE FIXED IF NOT SATISFIED AND A COMPLETE LIST OF THE MINISTRY APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS THOUGH THE THING HAD BEEN LONG A DOING STILL IT HAD COME SUDDENLY
4297-13009-0016 SO THAT AT THE FIRST PROPOSITION TO FORM A COALITION MINISTRY THE NEWSPAPERS HAD HARDLY KNOWN WHETHER TO ASSIST OR TO OPPOSE THE SCHEME THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF ALL THESE EDITORS AND CONTRIBUTORS THE TEACHING OF A TRADITION THAT COALITIONS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN GENERALLY FEEBLE
4297-13009-0018 AND WHEN AT THE SAME MOMENT TOGETHER WITH THE CHANGE HE SECURES POWER PATRONAGE AND PAY HOW SHALL THE PUBLIC VOICE ABSOLVE HIM BUT THEN AGAIN MEN WHO HAVE BY THE WORK OF THEIR LIVES GROWN INTO A CERTAIN POSITION IN THE COUNTRY
4297-13009-0019 AND HAVE UNCONSCIOUSLY BUT NOT THEREFORE LESS ACTUALLY MADE THEMSELVES INDISPENSABLE EITHER TO THIS SIDE IN POLITICS OR TO THAT CANNOT FREE THEMSELVES ALTOGETHER FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGING THEM WHEN A PERIOD COMES SUCH AS THAT NOW REACHED
4297-13009-0021 WHEN IT WAS FIRST KNOWN THAT THE DUKE OF OMNIUM HAD CONSENTED TO MAKE THE ATTEMPT THEY HAD BOTH ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER BEEN LOUD IN HIS PRAISE GOING SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN IN ENGLAND WHO COULD DO THE WORK
4297-13009-0022 BUT WHEN THE NEWSPAPERS TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS THE ONLY MAN FOR THE OCCASION HOW COULD HE BE JUSTIFIED IN CREDITING HIMSELF IN PREFERENCE TO THEM THE WORK IN PARLIAMENT BEGAN UNDER THE NEW AUSPICES WITH GREAT TRANQUILLITY
4297-13009-0024 AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED THAT ONE SPECIAL BENCH IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS WOULD REMAIN UNOCCUPIED BUT AFTER A DAY OR TWO ON ONE OF WHICH MISTER DAUBENY HAD BEEN SEEN SITTING JUST BELOW THE GANGWAY THAT GENTLEMAN RETURNED TO THE PLACE USUALLY HELD BY THE PRIME MINISTER'S RIVAL
4297-13009-0025 SAYING WITH A SMILE THAT IT MIGHT BE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE HOUSE THAT THE SEAT SHOULD BE UTILISED MISTER GRESHAM AT THIS TIME HAD WITH DECLARED PURPOSE ASKED AND OBTAINED THE SPEAKER'S LEAVE OF ABSENCE AND WAS ABROAD WHO SHOULD LEAD THE HOUSE
4297-13009-0027 WAS AT LAST ASSIGNED TO SIR ORLANDO DROUGHT IT WILL NEVER DO SAID MISTER RATTLER TO MISTER ROBY I DON'T MEAN TO SAY ANYTHING AGAINST DROUGHT WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY USEFUL MAN TO YOUR PARTY BUT HE LACKS SOMETHING OF THE POSITION
4297-13009-0028 THE FACT IS SAID ROBY THAT WE'VE TRUSTED TO TWO MEN SO LONG THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE BIG ENOUGH TO FILL THEIR PLACES MONK WOULDN'T HAVE DONE THE HOUSE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MONK I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE WILSON
4297-13009-0030 FOR MYSELF I'D HAVE SOONER STAYED OUT AS AN INDEPENDENT MEMBER BUT DAUBENY SAID THAT HE THOUGHT I WAS BOUND TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL I TOLD THE DUKE FROM THE BEGINNING SAID RATTLER THAT I DIDN'T THINK THAT I COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE TO HIM
4297-13009-0031 OF COURSE I WOULD SUPPORT HIM BUT I HAD BEEN TOO THOROUGHLY A PARTY MAN FOR A NEW MOVEMENT OF THIS KIND BUT HE SAID JUST THE SAME THAT HE CONSIDERED I WAS BOUND TO JOIN HIM I ASKED GRESHAM AND WHEN GRESHAM SAID SO TOO OF COURSE I HAD NO HELP FOR IT
4297-13009-0033 AND MISTER ROBY HAD BEEN FORCED TO CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE SECRETARYSHIP AT THE ADMIRALTY BUT AS THE OLD DUKE HAD SAID THEY WERE CLOSE FRIENDS AND PREPARED TO FIGHT TOGETHER ANY BATTLE WHICH MIGHT KEEP THEM IN THEIR PRESENT POSITION
4297-13009-0034 MANY OF THE CARES OF OFFICE THE PRIME MINISTER DID SUCCEED IN SHUFFLING OFF ALTOGETHER ON TO THE SHOULDERS OF HIS ELDER FRIEND HE WOULD NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE APPOINTMENT OF LADIES ABOUT WHOM HE SAID HE KNEW NOTHING
4297-13009-0036 AN ILLUSTRIOUS PERSONAGE THE MATTER AFFECTED OUR DUKE ONLY IN SO FAR THAT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS MIND THAT STRANGE APPLICATION FROM HIS OWN WIFE THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE EVEN DREAMED OF IT HE WOULD SAY TO HIMSELF
4297-13009-0037 THE DESIRE FOR PLOUGHING HAD COME UPON THE DUCHESS BUT THE DUKE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND IT HE PERCEIVED HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE MULTIPLICITY OF HIS OFFICIAL WORK THAT HIS REFUSAL SAT HEAVILY ON HIS WIFE'S BREAST AND THAT THOUGH SHE SPOKE NO FURTHER WORD
4297-13009-0039 THOUGH HE WOULD HARDLY KNOW THE CAUSE OF HIS MISERY HER RIDICULE AND RAILLERY HE COULD BEAR
4297-13009-0040 OR HER SULLENNESS IF EVER SHE WERE SULLEN UPSET HIM ALTOGETHER HE WAS IN TRUTH SO SOFT OF HEART
4297-13009-0042 HAD PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD SLAVE FOR HIM IF SLAVERY WERE NECESSARY THEN SHE HAD MADE HER REQUEST HAD BEEN REFUSED AND WAS NOW MOODY THE DUCHESS OF
4297-13009-0043 IS TO BE MISTRESS OF THE ROBES HE SAID TO HER ONE DAY HE HAD GONE TO HER UP TO HER OWN ROOM BEFORE HE DRESSED FOR DINNER HAVING DEVOTED MUCH MORE TIME THAN AS PRIME MINISTER HE OUGHT TO HAVE DONE TO A RESOLUTION THAT HE WOULD MAKE THINGS STRAIGHT WITH HER AND TO THE BEST WAY OF DOING IT
4297-13009-0045 AND I THINK THAT MAKES IT A VERY LONG TIME AGO LORD SILVERBRIDGE WAS THE DUKE'S ELDEST SON BUT WHAT DOES IT MATTER IF SHE BEGAN HER CAREER IN THE TIME OF GEORGE THE FOURTH WHAT IS IT TO YOU
4297-13009-0046 IT'S A PITY SHE SHOULD NOT REMEMBER HERS IN THE WAY SHE DRESSES SAID THE DUCHESS THIS WAS MARVELLOUS TO HIM THAT HIS WIFE
4297-13009-0048 I HOPE CORA YOU ARE NOT STILL DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE I DID NOT AGREE WITH YOU WHEN YOU SPOKE ABOUT THE PLACE FOR YOURSELF NOT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT THINK ME FIT TO BE TRUSTED WITH ANY JUDGMENT OF MY OWN
4297-13009-0049 AND FREE FROM BONDS BY WHICH THEY ARE CRAMPED AND CONFINED OF COURSE SUCH A TURN OF CHARACTER IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN DANGERS OF ITS OWN THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THE DANGERS THE CHANCES ARE THAT WHEN I SEE HER GRACE I SHALL TELL HER WHAT I THINK ABOUT HER
4297-13009-0051 YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW CONSTANTLY I CARRY YOU ABOUT WITH ME YOU CARRY A VERY UNNECESSARY BURDEN THEN SHE SAID BUT HE COULD TELL AT ONCE FROM THE ALTERED TONE OF HER VOICE AND FROM THE LIGHT OF HER EYE AS HE GLANCED INTO HER FACE
4297-13009-0052 THAT HER ANGER ABOUT THE ROBES WAS APPEASED I HAVE DONE AS YOU ASKED ABOUT A FRIEND OF YOURS HE SAID THIS OCCURRED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL AND PERFECTED LIST OF THE NEW MEN HAD APPEARED IN ALL THE NEWSPAPERS WHAT FRIEND
4297-13009-0054 YES I DO HE CERTAINLY COULDN'T GO AS LORD LIEUTENANT BUT THEY SAID THAT BARRINGTON ERLE WAS GOING TO IRELAND WELL YES I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU'D BE INTERESTED BY ALL THE INS AND OUTS OF IT

4340-15220-0060 AND PLANNING TO DO THE HONORS HANDSOMELY TO THE BOYS IT WAS VERY WARM AND JUST OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN THEY PAUSED BY A WAYSIDE WATERING TROUGH TO WASH THEIR DUSTY FACES

4340-15220-0078 LICKING HIS FACE IN SPITE OF HIS STRUGGLES BURROWING IN HIS NECK WITH A TICKLISH NOSE SNAPPING AT HIS BUTTONS AND YELPING JOYFULLY AS IF IT WAS THE BEST JOKE IN THE WORLD TO PLAY HIDE AND SEEK FOR FOUR LONG MILES
4340-15220-0079 BEFORE BEN COULD QUIET HIM BAB CAME CLIMBING UP THE BANK WITH SUCH A FUNNY MIXTURE OF FEAR FATIGUE DETERMINATION AND RELIEF IN HER DIRTY LITTLE FACE
4340-15220-0081 I COULDN'T MAKE HIM GO HOME SO I HAD TO HOLD ON TILL HE WAS SAFE HERE ELSE HE'D BE LOST AND THEN BEN WOULD FEEL BAD THE CLEVERNESS OF THAT EXCUSE TICKLED THE BOYS IMMENSELY

4340-15220-0084 I GUESS SHE'LL SAY YOU LED ME INTO MISCHIEF AND THE SHARP CHILD NODDED AS IF SHE DEFIED HIM TO DENY THE TRUTH OF THAT
4340-15220-0085 ADVISED SAM THINKING BAB GREAT FUN

4340-15220-0093 COMMANDED BEN GIVING SANCH A ROLL ON THE GRASS TO CLEAN HIM BAB SCRUBBED HER FACE TILL IT SHONE AND PULLING DOWN HER APRON TO WIPE IT SCATTERED A LOAD OF TREASURES COLLECTED IN HER WALK SOME OF THE DEAD FLOWERS
4340-15220-0094 BITS OF MOSS AND GREEN TWIGS FELL NEAR BEN AND ONE ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION A SPRAY OF BROAD SMOOTH LEAVES WITH A BUNCH OF WHITISH BERRIES ON IT WHERE DID YOU GET THAT HE ASKED POKING IT WITH HIS FOOT
4340-15220-0096 AND WITH INTENSE INTEREST NO ONLY A SNAKE AND I DON'T CARE FOR SNAKES I PICKED SOME OF THAT IT WAS SO GREEN AND PRETTY THORNY LIKES QUEER LEAVES AND BERRIES YOU KNOW ANSWERED BAB SPATTING DOWN HER ROUGH LOCKS
4340-15220-0097 WELL HE WON'T LIKE THAT NOR YOU EITHER
4340-15220-0099 AND BEN LOOKED ANXIOUSLY AT BAB WHO FELT HER CHUBBY FACE ALL OVER AND EXAMINED HER DINGY HANDS WITH A SOLEMN AIR ASKING EAGERLY WILL IT BREAK OUT ON ME FORE I GET TO THE CIRCUS
4340-15220-0100 NOT FOR A DAY OR SO I GUESS BUT IT'S BAD WHEN IT DOES COME
4362-15663-0001 MOSTLY BARE THAT EXTENDS FROM NEAR THE CAMP GROUND AT THE TIMBERLINE BUT ON MY FIRST EXCURSION TO THE SUMMIT THE WHOLE MOUNTAIN DOWN TO ITS LOW SWELLING BASE WAS SMOOTHLY LADEN WITH LOOSE FRESH SNOW
4362-15663-0002 PRESENTING A MOST GLORIOUS MASS OF WINTER MOUNTAIN SCENERY IN THE MIDST OF WHICH I SCRAMBLED AND REVELED OR LAY SNUGLY SNOWBOUND ENJOYING THE FERTILE CLOUDS AND THE SNOW BLOOM IN ALL THEIR GROWING DRIFTING GRANDEUR
4362-15663-0004 IT WAS THE CALM AFTERGLOW THAT USUALLY SUCCEEDS THE FIRST STORM OF THE WINTER I MET MANY OF THE BIRDS THAT HAD REARED THEIR YOUNG AND SPENT THEIR SUMMER IN THE SHASTA WOODS AND CHAPARRAL THEY WERE THEN ON THEIR WAY SOUTH TO THEIR WINTER HOMES
4362-15663-0005 LEADING THEIR YOUNG FULL FLEDGED AND ABOUT AS LARGE AND STRONG AS THE PARENTS SQUIRRELS DRY AND ELASTIC AFTER THE STORMS WERE BUSY ABOUT THEIR STORES OF PINE NUTS AND THE LATEST GOLDENRODS WERE STILL IN BLOOM THOUGH IT WAS NOW PAST THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER
4362-15663-0007 AT THE SALMON HATCHING ESTABLISHMENT ON THE MC CLOUD RIVER I HALTED A WEEK TO EXAMINE THE LIMESTONE BELT GRANDLY DEVELOPED THERE TO LEARN WHAT I COULD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE RIVER AND ITS BANKS
4362-15663-0008 AND TO GIVE TIME FOR THE FRESH SNOW THAT I KNEW HAD FALLEN ON THE MOUNTAIN TO SETTLE SOMEWHAT WITH A VIEW TO MAKING THE ASCENT A PEDESTRIAN ON THESE MOUNTAIN ROADS ESPECIALLY SO LATE IN THE YEAR IS SURE TO EXCITE CURIOSITY
4362-15663-0010 THE SNOW WAS TOO LOOSE AND DEEP TO CLIMB AND I SHOULD BE LOST IN DRIFTS AND SLIDES WHEN I HINTED THAT NEW SNOW WAS BEAUTIFUL AND STORMS NOT SO BAD AS THEY WERE CALLED MY ADVISERS SHOOK THEIR HEADS IN TOKEN OF SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE
4362-15663-0011 AND DECLARED THE ASCENT OF SHASTA BUTTE THROUGH LOOSE SNOW IMPOSSIBLE NEVERTHELESS BEFORE NOON OF THE SECOND OF NOVEMBER I WAS IN THE FROSTY AZURE OF THE UTMOST SUMMIT WHEN I ARRIVED AT SISSON'S EVERYTHING WAS QUIET
4362-15663-0013 AND THE FROSTS AND THE DANGERS OF MOUNTAINEERING SO LATE IN THE YEAR THEREFORE I COULD NOT ASK A GUIDE TO GO WITH ME EVEN HAD ONE BEEN WILLING ALL I WANTED WAS TO HAVE BLANKETS AND PROVISIONS DEPOSITED AS FAR UP IN THE TIMBER AS THE SNOW WOULD PERMIT A PACK ANIMAL TO GO
4362-15663-0014 THERE I COULD BUILD A STORM NEST AND LIE WARM AND MAKE RAIDS UP AND AROUND THE MOUNTAIN IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE WEATHER SETTING OUT ON THE AFTERNOON OF NOVEMBER FIRST WITH JEROME FAY MOUNTAINEER AND GUIDE IN CHARGE OF THE ANIMALS
4362-15663-0016 WHERE BREAKING THROUGH FOUR OR FIVE FEET OF MEALY SNOW THEIR FEET WERE CAUGHT BETWEEN ANGULAR BOULDERS HERE THEY WERE IN DANGER OF BEING LOST BUT AFTER WE HAD REMOVED PACKS AND SADDLES AND ASSISTED THEIR EFFORTS WITH ROPES
4362-15663-0017 THEY ALL ESCAPED TO THE SIDE OF A RIDGE ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET BELOW THE TIMBERLINE TO GO FARTHER WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION SO WE WERE COMPELLED TO CAMP AS BEST WE COULD A PITCH PINE FIRE SPEEDILY CHANGED THE TEMPERATURE
4362-15663-0019 AND INDICATED THE WAY AS WELL AS HE COULD IN THE DARKNESS HE SEEMED LOATH TO LEAVE ME BUT BEING REASSURED THAT I WAS AT HOME AND REQUIRED NO CARE HE BADE ME GOOD BYE AND RETURNED TO CAMP READY TO LEAD HIS ANIMALS DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT DAYBREAK
4362-15663-0020 ALONE IN THE SOLEMN SILENCE OF THE NIGHT HALF THE SKY WAS CLOUDED IN THE OTHER HALF THE STARS SPARKLED ICILY IN THE KEEN FROSTY AIR WHILE EVERYWHERE THE GLORIOUS WEALTH OF SNOW
4362-15663-0022 IN BLANK EXPOSURE TO THE DEEP UPPER CURRENTS OF THE SKY AND NO LABYRINTH OF PEAKS AND CANYONS I HAD EVER BEEN IN SEEMED TO ME SO DANGEROUS AS THESE IMMENSE SLOPES BARE AGAINST THE SKY
4362-15663-0023 THE FROST WAS INTENSE AND DRIFTING SNOW DUST MADE BREATHING AT TIMES RATHER DIFFICULT THE SNOW WAS AS DRY AS MEAL AND THE FINER PARTICLES DRIFTED FREELY RISING HIGH IN THE AIR WHILE THE LARGER PORTIONS OF THE CRYSTALS ROLLED LIKE SAND
4362-15663-0025 THIRTY FIVE DEGREES IN SOME PLACES MADE ANY KIND OF PROGRESS FATIGUING WHILE SMALL AVALANCHES WERE BEING CONSTANTLY SET IN MOTION IN THE STEEPEST PLACES BUT THE BRACING AIR AND THE SUBLIME BEAUTY OF THE SNOWY EXPANSE
4362-15663-0026 THRILLED EVERY NERVE AND MADE ABSOLUTE EXHAUSTION IMPOSSIBLE I SEEMED TO BE WALKING AND WALLOWING IN A CLOUD BUT HOLDING STEADILY ONWARD BY HALF PAST TEN O'CLOCK I HAD GAINED THE HIGHEST SUMMIT
4362-15663-0028 AND THE PATHWAYS OF VANISHED GLACIERS OF WHICH SHASTA HAD BEEN THE CENTER BUT AS I HAD LEFT MY COAT IN CAMP FOR THE SAKE OF HAVING MY LIMBS FREE IN CLIMBING I SOON WAS COLD THE WIND INCREASED IN VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0029 RAISING THE SNOW IN MAGNIFICENT DRIFTS THAT WERE DRAWN OUT IN THE FORM OF WAVERING BANNERS BLOWING IN THE SUN TOWARD THE END OF MY STAY A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CLOUDS STRUCK AGAINST THE SUMMIT ROCKS LIKE DRIFTING ICEBERGS
4362-15663-0031 I REACHED CAMP ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE DUSK HOLLOWED A STRIP OF LOOSE GROUND IN THE LEE OF A LARGE BLOCK OF RED LAVA WHERE FIREWOOD WAS ABUNDANT ROLLED MYSELF IN MY BLANKETS AND WENT TO SLEEP NEXT MORNING
4362-15663-0032 HAVING SLEPT LITTLE THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ASCENT AND BEING WEARY WITH CLIMBING AFTER THE EXCITEMENT WAS OVER I SLEPT LATE THEN AWAKING SUDDENLY MY EYES OPENED ON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND SUBLIME SCENES I EVER ENJOYED A BOUNDLESS WILDERNESS OF STORM CLOUDS
4362-15663-0034 BUT COLD GRAY MASSES DRIFTING LIKE DUST ON A WIND SWEPT PLAIN BEGAN TO SHUT OUT THE LIGHT FORERUNNERS OF THE COMING STORM I HAD BEEN SO ANXIOUSLY WATCHING I MADE HASTE TO GATHER AS MUCH WOOD AS POSSIBLE
4362-15663-0035 THE STORM SIDE OF MY BLANKETS WAS FASTENED DOWN WITH STAKES TO REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SIFTING IN OF DRIFT AND THE DANGER OF BEING BLOWN AWAY THE PRECIOUS BREAD SACK WAS PLACED SAFELY AS A PILLOW AND WHEN AT LENGTH THE FIRST FLAKES FELL
4362-15663-0037 WHILE IN CASE OF NEED I HAD THE MEANS OF MAKING SNOWSHOES AND COULD RETREAT OR HOLD MY GROUND AS I PLEASED PRESENTLY THE STORM BROKE FORTH INTO FULL SNOWY BLOOM AND THE THRONGING CRYSTALS DARKENED THE AIR
4362-15663-0038 THE WIND SWEPT PAST IN HISSING FLOODS GRINDING THE SNOW INTO MEAL AND SWEEPING DOWN INTO THE HOLLOWS IN ENORMOUS DRIFTS ALL THE HEAVIER PARTICLES WHILE THE FINER DUST WAS SIFTED THROUGH THE SKY INCREASING THE ICY GLOOM
4362-15663-0040 AS IF TO KNOW HOW THE WORK WAS ADVANCING DURING THESE CALM INTERVALS I REPLENISHED MY FIRE SOMETIMES WITHOUT LEAVING THE NEST FOR FIRE AND WOODPILE WERE SO NEAR THIS COULD EASILY BE DONE OR BUSIED MYSELF WITH MY NOTEBOOK
4362-15663-0041 WATCHING THE GESTURES OF THE TREES IN TAKING THE SNOW EXAMINING SEPARATE CRYSTALS UNDER A LENS AND LEARNING THE METHODS OF THEIR DEPOSITION AS AN ENDURING FOUNTAIN FOR THE STREAMS SEVERAL TIMES WHEN THE STORM CEASED FOR A FEW MINUTES
4362-15663-0043 THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL DOES NOT STRICTLY BELONG TO THESE UPPER WOODS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE HIM OUT IN SUCH WEATHER THE MOUNTAIN SHEEP ALSO QUITE A LARGE FLOCK OF THEM CAME TO MY CAMP AND TOOK SHELTER BESIDE A CLUMP OF MATTED DWARF PINES
4362-15663-0044 AND HE MUST SURELY HAVE PERISHED AND SISSON WAS BLAMED FOR ALLOWING ANY ONE TO ATTEMPT CLIMBING IN SUCH WEATHER WHILE I WAS AS SAFE AS ANYBODY IN THE LOWLANDS LYING LIKE A SQUIRREL IN A WARM FLUFFY NEST BUSIED ABOUT MY OWN AFFAIRS AND WISHING ONLY TO BE LET ALONE
4362-15663-0046 THE DAY INTERVENING BETWEEN THE TWO ASCENTS BEING DEVOTED TO ESTABLISHING A CAMP ON THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE TIMBERLINE HERE ON OUR RED TRACHYTE BED WE OBTAINED TWO HOURS OF SHALLOW SLEEP BROKEN FOR OCCASIONAL GLIMPSES OF THE KEEN STARRY NIGHT
4362-15663-0047 AT TWO O'CLOCK WE ROSE BREAKFASTED ON A WARMED TIN CUPFUL OF COFFEE AND A PIECE OF FROZEN VENISON BROILED ON THE COALS AND STARTED FOR THE SUMMIT UP TO THIS TIME THERE WAS NOTHING IN SIGHT THAT BETOKENED THE APPROACH OF A STORM
4362-15663-0049 AND OUR GLORIOUS MORNING IN THE SKY PROMISED NOTHING BUT ENJOYMENT AT NINE A M THE DRY THERMOMETER STOOD AT THIRTY FOUR DEGREES IN THE SHADE AND ROSE STEADILY UNTIL AT ONE P M IT STOOD AT FIFTY DEGREES
4362-15663-0050 PROBABLY INFLUENCED SOMEWHAT BY RADIATION FROM THE SUN WARMED CLIFFS A COMMON BUMBLEBEE NOT AT ALL BENUMBED ZIGZAGGED VIGOROUSLY ABOUT OUR HEADS FOR A FEW MOMENTS AS IF UNCONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE NEAREST HONEY FLOWER WAS A MILE BENEATH HIM
4362-15663-0052 THESE AT LENGTH UNITED WITH THE OLDER FIELD TOWARDS LASSEN'S BUTTE THUS ENCIRCLING MOUNT SHASTA IN ONE CONTINUOUS CLOUD ZONE RHETT AND KLAMATH LAKES WERE ECLIPSED BENEATH CLOUDS SCARCELY LESS BRILLIANT THAN THEIR OWN SILVERY DISKS
4362-15663-0053 THE MODOC LAVA BEDS MANY A SNOW LADEN PEAK FAR NORTH IN OREGON THE SCOTT AND TRINITY AND SISKIYOU MOUNTAINS THE PEAKS OF THE SIERRA THE BLUE COAST RANGE SHASTA VALLEY THE DARK FORESTS FILLING THE VALLEY OF THE SACRAMENTO
4362-15663-0055 ON THE CONTRARY THEY IMPRESSED ONE AS BEING LASTING ADDITIONS TO THE LANDSCAPE THE WEATHER OF THE SPRINGTIME AND SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE SIERRA IN GENERAL IS USUALLY VARIED BY SLIGHT LOCAL RAINS AND DUSTINGS OF SNOW
4362-15663-0056 MOST OF WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY FAR TOO JOYOUS AND LIFE GIVING TO BE REGARDED AS STORMS SINGLE CLOUDS GROWING IN THE SUNNY SKY RIPENING IN AN HOUR SHOWERING THE HEATED LANDSCAPE AND PASSING AWAY LIKE A THOUGHT
4362-15663-0058 SUGGESTING TO US THE IDEA OF AT ONCE SEEKING OUR SAFE CAMP IN THE TIMBER AND ABANDONING THE PURPOSE OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION OF THE BAROMETER AT THREE P M TWO HAVING ALREADY BEEN MADE
4362-15663-0059 WHILE SIMULTANEOUS OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE AT STRAWBERRY VALLEY JEROME PEERED AT SHORT INTERVALS OVER THE RIDGE CONTEMPLATING THE RISING CLOUDS WITH ANXIOUS GESTURES IN THE ROUGH WIND AND AT LENGTH DECLARED THAT IF WE DID NOT MAKE A SPEEDY ESCAPE
4362-15663-0061 AND I TOLD JEROME THAT WE TWO MOUNTAINEERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE OUR WAY DOWN THROUGH ANY STORM LIKELY TO FALL PRESENTLY THIN FIBROUS FILMS OF CLOUD BEGAN TO BLOW DIRECTLY OVER THE SUMMIT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH
4362-15663-0062 DRAWN OUT IN LONG FAIRY WEBS LIKE CARDED WOOL FORMING AND DISSOLVING AS IF BY MAGIC THE WIND TWISTED THEM INTO RINGLETS AND WHIRLED THEM IN A SUCCESSION OF GRACEFUL CONVOLUTIONS LIKE THE OUTSIDE SPRAYS OF YOSEMITE FALLS IN FLOOD TIME
4362-15663-0064 ILL DEFINED EMBANKMENT FROM THE ICY MESHES OF WHICH SNOW FLOWERS BEGAN TO FALL ALTERNATING WITH HAIL THE SKY SPEEDILY DARKENED AND JUST AS I HAD COMPLETED MY LAST OBSERVATION AND BOXED MY INSTRUMENTS READY FOR THE DESCENT
4362-15663-0065 THE STORM BEGAN IN SERIOUS EARNEST AT FIRST THE CLIFFS WERE BEATEN WITH HAIL EVERY STONE OF WHICH AS FAR AS I COULD SEE WAS REGULAR IN FORM SIX SIDED PYRAMIDS WITH ROUNDED BASE RICH AND SUMPTUOUS LOOKING AND FASHIONED WITH LOVING CARE
4362-15663-0067 THE STORM BECAME INCONCEIVABLY VIOLENT THE THERMOMETER FELL TWENTY TWO DEGREES IN A FEW MINUTES AND SOON DROPPED BELOW ZERO THE HAIL GAVE PLACE TO SNOW AND DARKNESS CAME ON LIKE NIGHT THE WIND RISING TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF VIOLENCE
4362-15663-0068 BOOMED AND SURGED AMID THE DESOLATE CRAGS LIGHTNING FLASHES IN QUICK SUCCESSION CUT THE GLOOMY DARKNESS AND THE THUNDERS THE MOST TREMENDOUSLY LOUD AND APPALLING I EVER HEARD MADE AN ALMOST CONTINUOUS ROAR
4362-15663-0070 WE MIGHT HAVE MADE GOOD OUR ESCAPE HOWEVER DARK AND WILD THE STORM AS IT WAS WE HAD FIRST TO MAKE OUR WAY ALONG A DANGEROUS RIDGE NEARLY A MILE AND A HALF LONG FLANKED IN MANY PLACES BY STEEP ICE SLOPES AT THE HEAD OF THE WHITNEY GLACIER ON ONE SIDE
4362-15663-0071 TO LET JEROME WHO HAD FALLEN A LITTLE BEHIND COME UP HERE HE OPENED A COUNCIL IN WHICH UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EXCITING BUT WITHOUT EVINCING ANY BEWILDERMENT HE MAINTAINED IN OPPOSITION TO MY VIEWS THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCEED
4362-15663-0073 JEROME MADE A DASH FROM THE SHELTER OF THE LAVA BLOCK AND BEGAN FORCING HIS WAY BACK AGAINST THE WIND TO THE HOT SPRINGS WAVERING AND STRUGGLING TO RESIST BEING CARRIED AWAY AS IF HE WERE FORDING A RAPID STREAM
4362-15663-0074 AFTER WAITING AND WATCHING IN VAIN FOR SOME FLAW IN THE STORM THAT MIGHT BE URGED AS A NEW ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF ATTEMPTING THE DESCENT I WAS COMPELLED TO FOLLOW HERE SAID JEROME AS WE SHIVERED IN THE MIDST OF THE HISSING SPUTTERING FUMAROLES
4362-15663-0076 BUT IT WAS ONLY ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS FOR THE SCALDING GAS JETS WERE SHORN OFF CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY THE OVERSWEEPING FLOOD OF FROSTY WIND AND HOW LAVISHLY THE SNOW FELL ONLY MOUNTAINEERS MAY KNOW THE CRISP CRYSTAL FLOWERS
4362-15663-0077 SEEMED TO TOUCH ONE ANOTHER AND FAIRLY TO THICKEN THE TREMENDOUS BLAST THAT CARRIED THEM THIS WAS THE BLOOM TIME THE SUMMER OF THE CLOUD AND NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN EVEN A MOUNTAIN CLOUD FLOWERING SO PROFUSELY
4362-15663-0079 SOME CRYSTALS LANDED WITH THEIR RAYS ALMOST PERFECT BUT MOST OF THEM WERE WORN AND BROKEN BY STRIKING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER OR BY ROLLING ON THE GROUND THE TOUCH OF THESE SNOW FLOWERS IN CALM WEATHER IS INFINITELY GENTLE GLINTING SWAYING
4362-15663-0080 SETTLING SILENTLY IN THE DRY MOUNTAIN AIR OR MASSED IN FLAKES SOFT AND DOWNY TO LIE OUT ALONE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF A STILL NIGHT AND BE TOUCHED BY THE FIRST OF THESE SMALL SILENT MESSENGERS FROM THE SKY IS A MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE
4362-15663-0082 A WEAVING OF TRANSLUCENT TISSUE ABOVE THEN THE ROAR OF THE WIND AND THE THUNDER AND THE DARKENING FLIGHT OF SNOW ITS SUBSIDENCE WAS NOT LESS SUDDEN THE CLOUDS BROKE AND VANISHED NOT A CRYSTAL WAS LEFT IN THE SKY
4362-15663-0083 AND IN MANY PLACES REACHED THE SKIN WE WERE GLAD AT FIRST TO SEE THE SNOW PACKING ABOUT US HOPING IT WOULD DEADEN THE FORCE OF THE WIND BUT IT SOON FROZE INTO A STIFF CRUSTY HEAP AS THE TEMPERATURE FELL RATHER AUGMENTING OUR NOVEL MISERY
4362-15663-0085 MIGHT COLLECT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES TO CAUSE SLEEP AND DEATH
4362-15663-0086 EVEN SHOULD HIS SUFFERINGS ADMIT OF SUCH A THING ACCORDINGLY WHEN DURING THE LONG DREARY WATCHES OF THE NIGHT WE ROUSED FROM A STATE OF HALF CONSCIOUSNESS WE CALLED EACH OTHER BY NAME IN A FRIGHTENED STARTLED WAY
4362-15663-0088 THAT NOW SMOULDERS NOW BRIGHTENS AND MAY BE EASILY QUENCHED THE WEARY HOURS WORE AWAY LIKE DIM HALF FORGOTTEN YEARS SO LONG AND EVENTFUL THEY SEEMED THOUGH WE DID NOTHING BUT SUFFER
4362-15663-0089 STILL THE PAIN WAS NOT ALWAYS OF THAT BITTER INTENSE KIND THAT PRECLUDES THOUGHT AND TAKES AWAY ALL CAPACITY FOR ENJOYMENT A SORT OF DREAMY STUPOR CAME ON AT TIMES
4362-15663-0091 SHINING WITH MARVELOUS BRIGHTNESS WITH LONG LANCE RAYS NEAR LOOKING AND NEW LOOKING AS IF NEVER SEEN BEFORE AGAIN THEY WOULD LOOK FAMILIAR AND REMIND US OF STARGAZING AT HOME OFTENTIMES IMAGINATION COMING INTO PLAY
4362-15663-0092 THE FROST GREW MORE AND MORE INTENSE AND WE BECAME ICY AND COVERED OVER WITH A CRUST OF FROZEN SNOW
4362-15663-0094 AND HOUR AFTER HOUR PASSED BY WHILE WE EAGERLY WATCHED THE PALE LIGHT STEALING DOWN THE RIDGE TO THE HOLLOW WHERE WE LAY BUT THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF THAT WARM FLUSHING SUNRISE SPLENDOR WE SO LONG HAD HOPED FOR
4362-15663-0095 AS THE TIME DREW NEAR TO MAKE AN EFFORT TO REACH CAMP WE BECAME CONCERNED TO KNOW WHAT STRENGTH WAS LEFT US AND WHETHER OR NO WE COULD WALK FOR WE HAD LAIN FLAT ALL THIS TIME WITHOUT ONCE RISING TO OUR FEET
4362-15663-0097 AT LENGTH AFTER THE TEMPERATURE WAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED ON THIS MEMORABLE FIRST OF MAY WE AROSE AND BEGAN TO STRUGGLE HOMEWARD OUR FROZEN TROUSERS COULD SCARCELY BE MADE TO BEND AT THE KNEE AND WE WADED THE SNOW WITH DIFFICULTY
4362-15663-0098 THE SUMMIT RIDGE WAS FORTUNATELY WIND SWEPT AND NEARLY BARE SO WE WERE NOT COMPELLED TO LIFT OUR FEET HIGH AND ON REACHING THE LONG HOME SLOPES LADEN WITH LOOSE SNOW WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS SLIDING AND SHUFFLING AND PITCHING HEADLONG
4362-15663-0100 HALF AN HOUR LATER WE HEARD SISSON SHOUTING DOWN AMONG THE FIRS COMING WITH HORSES TO TAKE US TO THE HOTEL AFTER BREAKING A TRAIL THROUGH THE SNOW AS FAR AS POSSIBLE HE HAD TIED HIS ANIMALS AND WALKED UP WE HAD BEEN SO LONG WITHOUT FOOD
4362-15663-0101 THAT WE CARED BUT LITTLE ABOUT EATING BUT WE EAGERLY DRANK THE COFFEE HE PREPARED FOR US OUR FEET WERE FROZEN AND THAWING THEM WAS PAINFUL AND HAD TO BE DONE VERY SLOWLY BY KEEPING THEM BURIED IN SOFT SNOW FOR SEVERAL HOURS
4362-15663-0103 NOTWITHSTANDING ITS TERRIFIC FURY OUR FEET WERE WRAPPED IN SACKING AND WE WERE SOON MOUNTED AND ON OUR WAY DOWN INTO THE THICK SUNSHINE GOD'S COUNTRY AS SISSON CALLS THE CHAPARRAL ZONE
4362-15663-0104 HOW BEAUTIFUL SEEMED THE GOLDEN SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE WOODS BETWEEN THE WARM BROWN BOLES OF THE CEDARS AND PINES ALL MY FRIENDS AMONG THE BIRDS AND PLANTS SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS AND WE FELT LIKE SPEAKING TO EVERY ONE OF THEM AS WE PASSED
4362-15663-0106 AND FROM THE WINDOW I SAW THE GREAT WHITE SHASTA CONE CLAD IN FORESTS AND CLOUDS AND BEARING THEM LOFTILY IN THE SKY EVERYTHING SEEMED FULL AND RADIANT WITH THE FRESHNESS AND BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM OF YOUTH
4397-15666-0000 THE GREATER PORTION OF THE CALENDAR SPRINGTIME OF UTAH HAS BEEN WINTER IN ALL THE UPPER CANYONS OF THE MOUNTAINS THE SNOW IS NOW FROM FIVE TO TEN FEET DEEP OR MORE AND MOST OF IT HAS FALLEN SINCE MARCH
4397-15666-0002 WIND RAIN AND SNOW FILLED THE WHOLE BASIN DRIVING WILDLY OVER VALLEY AND PLAIN FROM RANGE TO RANGE BESTOWING THEIR BENEFACTIONS IN MOST CORDIAL AND HARMONIOUS STORM MEASURES
4397-15666-0003 WITH BILLOWS OF DUST AND SAND
4397-15666-0005 POLITICS AND RELIGION ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE STORM REACHED THE CITY I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO BE OUT WITH A FRIEND ON THE BANKS OF THE JORDAN ENJOYING THE SCENERY CLOUDS WITH PECULIARLY RESTLESS AND SELF CONSCIOUS GESTURES
4397-15666-0006 WERE MARSHALING THEMSELVES ALONG THE MOUNTAIN TOPS AND SENDING OUT LONG OVERLAPPING WINGS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND EVEN WHERE NO CLOUD WAS VISIBLE AN OBSCURING FILM ABSORBED THE SUNLIGHT GIVING RISE TO A COLD BLUISH DARKNESS NEVERTHELESS
4397-15666-0008 TURNING FROM RANGE TO RANGE STUDYING THE DARKENING SKY AND LISTENING TO THE STILL SMALL VOICES OF THE FLOWERS AT OUR FEET SOME OF THE DENSER CLOUDS CAME DOWN CROWNING AND WREATHING THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND DROPPING LONG GRAY FRINGES
4397-15666-0009 WHOSE SMOOTH LINEAR STRUCTURE SHOWED THAT SNOW WAS BEGINNING TO FALL OF THESE PARTIAL STORMS THERE WERE SOON TEN OR TWELVE ARRANGED IN TWO ROWS WHILE THE MAIN JORDAN VALLEY BETWEEN THEM LAY AS YET IN PROFOUND CALM AT FOUR THIRTY P M
4397-15666-0011 EXCITED OUR ATTENTION WITHOUT ENABLING US TO DECIDE CERTAINLY AS TO ITS CHARACTER BUT WE WERE NOT LEFT LONG IN DOUBT FOR IN A FEW MINUTES IT CAME SWEEPING OVER THE VALLEY IN A WILD UPROAR A TORRENT OF WIND THICK WITH SAND AND DUST
4397-15666-0012 ADVANCING WITH A MOST MAJESTIC FRONT ROLLING AND OVERCOMBING LIKE A GIGANTIC SEA WAVE SCARCELY WAS IT IN PLAIN SIGHT ERE IT WAS UPON US RACING ACROSS THE JORDAN OVER THE CITY
4397-15666-0014 THE CRYSTAL FLAKES FALLING IN THE FOUL STREETS WAS A PITIFUL SIGHT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VAUNTED REFINING INFLUENCES OF TOWNS PURITY OF ALL KINDS PURE HEARTS PURE STREAMS PURE SNOW
4397-15666-0015 MUST HERE BE EXPOSED TO TERRIBLE TRIALS CITY CREEK COMING FROM ITS HIGH GLACIAL FOUNTAINS ENTERS THE STREETS OF THIS MORMON ZION PURE AS AN ANGEL BUT HOW DOES IT LEAVE IT
4397-15666-0017 THOUGH PERCHANCE THEY MIGHT BE SAUNTERING BY WITH LITTLE ELSE TO DO THAN CHAT WITH THEM POSSIBLY THERE MAY BE SALT LAKE FAMILIES SUFFICIENTLY PURE FOR ANGEL SOCIETY BUT I WAS NOT PLEASED WITH THE RECEPTION THEY GAVE THE SMALL SNOW ANGELS THAT GOD SENT AMONG THEM THE OTHER NIGHT
4397-15666-0018 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAILED THEM WITH DELIGHT THE OLD LATTER DAYS SEEMED TO SHUN THEM I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE HOW MISTER YOUNG THE LAKE PROPHET WOULD MEET SUCH MESSENGERS BUT TO RETURN TO THE STORM
4397-15666-0020 LOOKING ACROSS THE JORDAN THE GRAY SAGEY SLOPES FROM THE BASE OF THE OQUIRRH MOUNTAINS WERE COVERED WITH A THICK PLUSHY CLOTH OF GOLD SOFT AND ETHEREAL AS A CLOUD NOT MERELY TINTED AND GILDED LIKE A ROCK WITH AUTUMN SUNSHINE BUT DEEPLY MUFFLED BEYOND RECOGNITION
4397-15666-0021 SURELY NOTHING IN HEAVEN NOR ANY MANSION OF THE LORD IN ALL HIS WORLDS COULD BE MORE GLORIOUSLY CARPETED OTHER PORTIONS OF THE PLAIN WERE FLUSHED WITH RED AND PURPLE AND ALL THE MOUNTAINS AND THE CLOUDS ABOVE THEM WERE PAINTED IN CORRESPONDING LOVELINESS
4397-15666-0023 BUT NOTHING COMPARABLE WITH THIS I FELT AS IF NEW ARRIVED IN SOME OTHER FAR OFF WORLD THE MOUNTAINS THE PLAINS THE SKY ALL SEEMED NEW OTHER EXPERIENCES SEEMED BUT TO HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THIS AS SOULS ARE PREPARED FOR HEAVEN
4397-15666-0024 TRAILED THEIR LUSTROUS FRINGES THROUGH THE PINES AS IF TAKING A LAST VIEW OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHED WORK THEN CAME DARKNESS AND THE GLORIOUS DAY WAS DONE
4397-15666-0026 AND THE FARMERS GRAIN ARE FRESH AS IF LIKE THE SNOW THEY HAD COME OUT OF HEAVEN
4397-15668-0000 YOU MAY WALK THE DESERTS OF THE GREAT BASIN IN THE BLOOM TIME OF THE YEAR ALL THE WAY ACROSS FROM THE SNOWY SIERRA TO THE SNOWY WAHSATCH AND YOUR EYES WILL BE FILLED WITH MANY A GAY MALVA AND POPPY AND ABRONIA AND CACTUS
4397-15668-0002 NEVERTHELESS IN THE BUILDING AND PLANTING OF THIS GRAND TERRITORY THE LILIES WERE NOT FORGOTTEN FAR BACK IN THE DIM GEOLOGIC AGES WHEN THE SEDIMENTS OF THE OLD SEAS WERE BEING GATHERED AND OUTSPREAD IN SMOOTH SHEETS LIKE LEAVES OF A BOOK
4397-15668-0003 AND WHEN THESE SEDIMENTS BECAME DRY LAND AND WERE BAKED AND CRUMBLED INTO THE SKY AS MOUNTAIN RANGES WHEN THE LAVA FLOODS OF THE FIRE PERIOD WERE BEING LAVISHLY POURED FORTH FROM INNUMERABLE RIFTS AND CRATERS
4397-15668-0005 AND WHILE PLANTING THE PLAINS WITH SAGE AND THE HILLS WITH CEDAR SHE HAS COVERED AT LEAST ONE MOUNTAIN WITH GOLDEN ERYTHRONIUMS AND FRITILLARIAS AS ITS CROWNING GLORY AS IF WILLING TO SHOW WHAT SHE COULD DO IN THE LILY LINE EVEN HERE
4397-15668-0006 LOOKING SOUTHWARD FROM THE SOUTH END OF SALT LAKE THE TWO NORTHMOST PEAKS OF THE OQUIRRH RANGE ARE SEEN SWELLING CALMLY INTO THE COOL SKY WITHOUT ANY MARKED CHARACTER EXCEPTING ONLY THEIR SNOW CROWNS
4397-15668-0008 AND OVER ALL THE SMOOTH CROWN OF SNOW WHILE STANDING AT THEIR FEET THE OTHER DAY SHORTLY AFTER MY MEMORABLE EXCURSION AMONG THE SALT WAVES OF THE LAKE I SAID NOW I SHALL HAVE ANOTHER BAPTISM
4397-15668-0009 I WILL BATHE IN THE HIGH SKY AMONG COOL WIND WAVES FROM THE SNOW FROM THE MORE SOUTHERLY OF THE TWO PEAKS A LONG RIDGE COMES DOWN BENT LIKE A BOW ONE END IN THE HOT PLAINS THE OTHER IN THE SNOW OF THE SUMMIT
4397-15668-0011 I WAS ANIMATED BY A MOUNTAINEER'S EAGERNESS TO GET MY FEET INTO THE SNOW ONCE MORE AND MY HEAD INTO THE CLEAR SKY AFTER LYING DORMANT ALL WINTER AT THE LEVEL OF THE SEA BUT IN EVERY WALK WITH NATURE ONE RECEIVES FAR MORE THAN HE SEEKS
4397-15668-0012 I HAD NOT GONE MORE THAN A MILE FROM LAKE POINT ERE I FOUND THE WAY PROFUSELY DECKED WITH FLOWERS MOSTLY COMPOSITAE AND PURPLE LEGUMINOSAE A HUNDRED COROLLAS OR MORE TO THE SQUARE YARD WITH A CORRESPONDING ABUNDANCE OF WINGED BLOSSOMS ABOVE THEM MOTHS AND BUTTERFLIES
4397-15668-0014 NEVER BEFORE IN ALL MY WALKS HAVE I MET SO GLORIOUS A THRONG OF THESE FINE SHOWY LILIACEOUS PLANTS THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE WAS AGLOW WITH THEM FROM A HEIGHT OF FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET TO THE VERY EDGE OF THE SNOW
4397-15668-0015 ON THE UPPER SIDE WHERE THE BUSHES WERE MORE OPEN BUT A COMPANY COMPOSED OF THE TWO LILIES I HAVE MENTIONED WERE BLOOMING ON THE LOWER SIDE AND THOUGH THEY WERE AS YET OUT OF SIGHT I SUDDENLY CHANGED MY MIND AND WENT DOWN TO MEET THEM
4397-15668-0017 AND I NEED NOT TRY TO TELL THE JOY THEY MADE THEY ARE BOTH LOWLY PLANTS LOWLY AS VIOLETS THE TALLEST SELDOM EXCEEDING SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT SO THAT THE MOST SEARCHING WINDS THAT SWEEP THE MOUNTAINS SCARCE REACH LOW ENOUGH TO SHAKE THEIR BELLS
4397-15668-0018 THE PETALS BEING STRONGLY RECURVED LIKE THOSE OF LILIUM SUPERBUM OCCASIONALLY A SPECIMEN IS MET WHICH HAS FROM TWO TO FIVE FLOWERS HUNG IN A LOOSE PANICLE PEOPLE OFTENTIMES TRAVEL FAR TO SEE CURIOUS PLANTS LIKE THE CARNIVOROUS DARLINGTONIA
4397-15668-0020 PUSHING ON UP THE RUGGED SLOPES I FOUND MANY DELIGHTFUL SECLUSIONS MOIST NOOKS AT THE FOOT OF CLIFFS AND LILIES IN EVERY ONE OF THEM NOT GROWING CLOSE TOGETHER LIKE DAISIES BUT WELL APART WITH PLENTY OF ROOM FOR THEIR BELLS TO SWING FREE AND RING
4397-15668-0021 I FOUND HUNDREDS OF THEM IN FULL BLOOM WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE SNOW IN WINTER ONLY THE BULBS ARE ALIVE SLEEPING DEEP BENEATH THE GROUND LIKE FIELD MICE IN THEIR NESTS THEN THE SNOW FLOWERS FALL ABOVE THEM LILIES OVER LILIES
4397-15668-0023 AND AT THE HEIGHT OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET I CAME UPON THE FRESH TRAIL OF A FLOCK OF WILD SHEEP SHOWING THAT THESE FINE MOUNTAINEERS STILL FLOURISH HERE ABOVE THE RANGE OF MORMON RIFLES IN THE PLANTING OF HER WILD GARDENS
4397-15668-0024 NATURE TAKES THE FEET AND TEETH OF HER FLOCKS INTO ACCOUNT AND MAKES USE OF THEM TO TRIM AND CULTIVATE AND KEEP THEM IN ORDER AS THE BARK AND BUDS OF THE TREE ARE TENDED BY WOODPECKERS AND LINNETS THE EVERGREEN WOODS CONSIST AS FAR AS I OBSERVED OF TWO SPECIES
4397-15668-0026 SNOWY ICE SCULPTURED RANGES BOUNDED THE HORIZON ALL AROUND WHILE THE GREAT LAKE EIGHTY MILES LONG AND FIFTY MILES WIDE LAY FULLY REVEALED BENEATH A LILY SKY
4397-15668-0027 AND THE WIDE PRAIRIE OF WATER GLOWING IN THE GOLD AND PURPLE OF EVENING PRESENTED ALL THE COLORS THAT TINT THE LIPS OF SHELLS AND THE PETALS OF LILIES THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LAKE THIS SIDE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS UTAH LAKE
4397-15668-0029 THE GRANDEST I HAD CARRIED IN MANY A DAY I REACHED THE HOTEL ON THE LAKE ABOUT DUSK WITH ALL MY FRESH RICHES AND MY FIRST MOUNTAIN RAMBLE IN UTAH WAS ACCOMPLISHED ON MY WAY BACK TO THE CITY THE NEXT DAY
4397-15668-0030 I SHOOK MY BIG HANDFUL OF LILIES IN HIS FACE AND SHOUTED HERE ARE THE TRUE SAINTS ANCIENT AND LATTER DAY ENDURING FOREVER
4397-15668-0032 ARE TWO SPECIES OF ZIGADENAS FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA
4397-15668-0033 AND THREE OR FOUR HANDSOME ALLIUMS ONE OF THESE LILIES THE CALOCHORTUS SEVERAL SPECIES OF WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN IN CALIFORNIA AS THE MARIPOSA TULIPS HAS RECEIVED GREAT CONSIDERATION AT THE HANDS OF THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0035 AND THROUGHOUT ONE HUNGRY WINTER IN PARTICULAR THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE SUBSISTED CHIEFLY ON THE BULBS OF THE TULIPS CALLED SEGO BY THE INDIANS WHO TAUGHT THEM ITS USE LILIACEOUS WOMEN AND GIRLS ARE RARE AMONG THE MORMONS
4397-15668-0036 OFTEN CURIOUSLY FRECKLED LIKE THE PETALS OF FRITILLARIA ATROPURPUREA THEY ARE FRUIT RATHER THAN FLOWER GOOD BROWN BREAD BUT DOWN IN THE SAN PITCH VALLEY AT GUNNISON I DISCOVERED A GENUINE LILY HAPPILY NAMED LILY YOUNG
4397-15668-0038 HAS BEEN TRANSPLANTED TO THIS WILDERNESS WHERE SHE BLOOMS ALONE THE LILY OF SAN PITCH PITCH IS AN OLD INDIAN WHO I SUPPOSE PITCHED INTO THE SETTLERS AND THUS ACQUIRED FAME ENOUGH TO GIVE NAME TO THE VALLEY
4397-15668-0039 HERE I FEEL UNEASY ABOUT THE NAME OF THIS LILY FOR THE COMPOSITORS HAVE A PERVERSE TRICK OF MAKING ME SAY ALL KINDS OF ABSURD THINGS WHOLLY UNWARRANTED BY PLAIN COPY AND I FEAR THAT THE LILY OF SAN PITCH WILL APPEAR IN PRINT AS THE WIDOW OF SAM PATCH
4397-15678-0001 A VERY DIFFERENT MAN SEEN NOW AND THEN AT LONG INTERVALS BUT USUALLY INVISIBLE IS THE FREE ROAMER OF THE WILDERNESS HUNTER PROSPECTOR EXPLORER SEEKING HE KNOWS NOT WHAT LITHE AND SINEWY HE WALKS ERECT
4397-15678-0002 MAKING HIS WAY WITH THE SKILL OF WILD ANIMALS ALL HIS SENSES IN ACTION WATCHFUL AND ALERT LOOKING KEENLY AT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT HIS IMAGINATION WELL NOURISHED IN THE WEALTH OF THE WILDERNESS COMING INTO CONTACT WITH FREE NATURE IN A THOUSAND FORMS
4397-15678-0004 OTHERS HALF SETTLE DOWN AND CHANGE IN PART INTO FARMERS EACH MAKING CHOICE OF SOME FERTILE SPOT WHERE THE LANDSCAPE ATTRACTS HIM BUILDS A SMALL CABIN WHERE WITH FEW WANTS TO SUPPLY FROM GARDEN OR FIELD HE HUNTS AND FARMS IN TURN
4397-15678-0005 UNTIL NIGHT BEGINS TO DRAW NEAR AND LIKE FOREST SHADOWS THICKENS INTO DARKNESS AND HIS DAY IS DONE IN THESE WASHINGTON WILDS LIVING ALONE ALL SORTS OF MEN MAY PERCHANCE BE FOUND POETS PHILOSOPHERS
4397-15678-0007 NOR IN YOUR WALKS IN THE WOODS WILL YOU BE LIKELY TO SEE MANY OF THE WILD ANIMALS HOWEVER FAR YOU MAY GO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DOUGLAS SQUIRREL AND THE MOUNTAIN GOAT THE SQUIRREL IS EVERYWHERE AND THE GOAT YOU CAN HARDLY FAIL TO FIND IF YOU CLIMB ANY OF THE HIGH MOUNTAINS THE DEER
4397-15678-0008 TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE BY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND SWIMMING TO THE ISLANDS OFF SHORE THE ELK AND PERHAPS ALSO THE MOOSE STILL EXIST IN THE MOST REMOTE AND INACCESSIBLE SOLITUDES OF THE FOREST BUT THEIR NUMBERS HAVE BEEN GREATLY REDUCED OF LATE
4397-15678-0010 AND ALONG THE RIVERS WHILE SALMON ARE GOING UP TO SPAWN THE BLACK BEAR MAY BE FOUND FAT AND AT HOME MANY ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BOTH FOR THEIR FLESH AND SKINS THE LARGE BROWN SPECIES LIKES HIGHER AND OPENER GROUND
4397-15678-0011 HE IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE FAMOUS GRIZZLY AND WISE HUNTERS ARE VERY FOND OF LETTING HIM ALONE THE TOWNS OF PUGET SOUND ARE OF A VERY LIVELY PROGRESSIVE AND ASPIRING KIND
4397-15678-0013 SEATTLE IS ALSO CHARMINGLY LOCATED ABOUT TWENTY MILES DOWN THE SOUND FROM TACOMA ON ELLIOTT BAY IT IS THE TERMINUS OF THE SEATTLE LAKE SHORE AND EASTERN RAILROAD NOW IN PROCESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CALLS ITSELF THE QUEEN CITY OF THE SOUND
4397-15678-0014 AMONG THE TREES AND STUMPS AND BRUSH WHICH HIDE A GOOD MANY OF THE HOUSES AND THE STAKES WHICH MARK THE LOTS SO THAT WITHOUT BEING AS YET VERY LARGE TOWNS THEY SEEM TO FADE AWAY INTO THE DISTANCE
4397-15678-0016 PAVED BROADWAYS AND BOULEVARDS SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS BLOCKS SCHOOLS CHURCHES FACTORIES AND FOUNDRIES THE LUSTY TITANIC CLANG OF BOILER MAKING MAY BE HEARD THERE
4397-15678-0017 AND PLENTY OF THE LANGUID MUSIC OF PIANOS MINGLING WITH THE BABEL NOISES OF COMMERCE CARRIED ON IN A HUNDRED TONGUES THE MAIN STREETS ARE CROWDED WITH BRIGHT WIDE AWAKE LAWYERS MINISTERS MERCHANTS AGENTS FOR EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
4397-15678-0019 VIGOROUS LIFE AND STRIFE ARE TO BE SEEN EVERYWHERE THE SPIRIT OF PROGRESS IS IN THE AIR STILL IT IS HARD TO REALIZE HOW MUCH GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE HERE OF A KIND THAT MAKES FOR CIVILIZATION THE ENTHUSIASTIC EXULTING ENERGY DISPLAYED IN THE BUILDING OF NEW TOWNS
4397-15678-0020 RAILROADS AND MILLS IN THE OPENING OF MINES OF COAL AND IRON AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES IN GENERAL TO MANY ESPECIALLY IN THE ATLANTIC STATES WASHINGTON IS HARDLY KNOWN AT ALL IT IS REGARDED AS BEING YET A FAR WILD WEST
4397-15678-0022 WHILE ON SOME OF THE LINES OF ADVANCEMENT IT IS AT THE FRONT NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHARP RIVALRY BETWEEN DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND TOWNS THE LEADING MEN MOSTLY PULL TOGETHER FOR THE GENERAL GOOD AND GLORY
4397-15678-0023 BUILDING BUYING BORROWING TO PUSH THE COUNTRY TO ITS PLACE KEEPING ARITHMETIC BUSY IN COUNTING POPULATION PRESENT AND TO COME SHIPS TOWNS FACTORIES TONS OF COAL AND IRON FEET OF LUMBER MILES OF RAILROAD
4397-15678-0025 HE WAS VERY PROUD OF THE HONOR AND LIVED LONG ENOUGH TO LEAD HIS GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT THE STREETS THE GREATER PART OF THE LOWER BUSINESS PORTION OF THE TOWN INCLUDING A LONG STRETCH OF WHARVES AND WAREHOUSES BUILT ON PILES
4397-15678-0026 THE PEOPLE HOWEVER ARE IN NO WISE DISCOURAGED AND ERE LONG THE LOSS WILL BE GAIN INASMUCH AS A BETTER CLASS OF BUILDINGS CHIEFLY OF BRICK ARE BEING ERECTED IN PLACE OF THE INFLAMMABLE WOODEN ONES WHICH WITH COMPARATIVELY FEW EXCEPTIONS WERE BUILT OF PITCHY SPRUCE
4397-15678-0028 AND A LOOK INTO THE BLACK DEPTHS OF THE UNDERWORLD OTHERS AGAIN TAKE THE STEAMERS FOR VICTORIA FRASER RIVER OR VANCOUVER THE NEW AMBITIOUS TOWN AT THE TERMINUS OF THE CANADIAN RAILROAD THUS GETTING VIEWS OF THE OUTER WORLD IN A NEAR FOREIGN COUNTRY
4397-15678-0029 GREEN RIVER IS A SMALL ROCKY STREAM WITH PICTURESQUE BANKS AND DERIVES ITS NAME FROM THE BEAUTIFUL PALE GREEN HUE OF ITS WATERS AMONG THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL THE SUMMER REST AND PLEASURE PLACES IS THE FAMOUS HOP RANCH ON THE UPPER SNOQUALMIE RIVER
4397-15678-0031 HALF PRAIRIE LEVEL AND FERTILE AND BEAUTIFULLY DIVERSIFIED WITH OUTSTANDING GROVES OF SPRUCES AND ALDERS AND RICH FLOWERY FRINGES OF SPIRAEA AND WILD ROSES THE RIVER MEANDERING DEEP AND TRANQUIL THROUGH THE MIDST OF IT
4397-15678-0032 ON THE PORTIONS MOST EASILY CLEARED SOME THREE HUNDRED ACRES OF HOP VINES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND ARE NOW IN FULL BEARING YIELDING IT IS SAID AT THE RATE OF ABOUT A TON OF HOPS TO THE ACRE THEY ARE A BEAUTIFUL CROP THESE VINES OF THE NORTH
4397-15678-0034 MIGHT BE RAISED IN WASHINGTON FOR THE WANTS OF ALL THE WORLD BUT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND PICKERS TO HANDLE THE CROP MOST OF THE PICKING IS DONE BY INDIANS AND TO THIS FINE CLEAN PROFITABLE WORK THEY COME IN GREAT NUMBERS IN THEIR CANOES OLD AND YOUNG
4397-15678-0035 STILL MORE STRIKING ARE THEIR QUEER CAMPS ON THE EDGES OF THE FIELDS OR OVER ON THE RIVER BANK WITH THE FIRELIGHT SHINING ON THEIR WILD JOLLY FACES BUT WOE TO THE RANCH SHOULD FIRE WATER GET THERE BUT THE CHIEF ATTRACTIONS HERE ARE NOT FOUND IN THE HOPS
4397-15678-0037 AND FINE VIEWS OF THE FALL MAY BE HAD ON THAT SIDE BOTH FROM ABOVE AND BELOW IT IS SITUATED ON THE MAIN RIVER WHERE IT PLUNGES OVER A SHEER PRECIPICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FEET HIGH IN LEAVING THE LEVEL MEADOWS OF THE ANCIENT LAKE BASIN
4397-15678-0038 THE POOL IS OF CONSIDERABLE DEPTH AS IS SHOWN BY THE RADIATING WELL BEATEN FOAM AND MIST WHICH IS OF A BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR AT TIMES OF EXQUISITE FINENESS OF TONE AND BY THE HEAVY WAVES THAT LASH THE ROCKS IN FRONT OF IT
4397-15678-0040 THE ROAD LEADS THROUGH MAJESTIC WOODS WITH FERNS TEN FEET HIGH BENEATH SOME OF THE THICKETS AND ACROSS A GRAVELLY PLAIN DEFORESTED BY FIRE MANY YEARS AGO ORANGE LILIES ARE PLENTIFUL
4397-15678-0041 AND HANDSOME SHINING MATS OF THE KINNIKINIC SPRINKLED WITH BRIGHT SCARLET BERRIES FROM A PLACE CALLED HUNT'S AT THE END OF THE WAGON ROAD A TRAIL LEADS THROUGH LUSH DRIPPING WOODS NEVER DRY
4397-15678-0043 THE MAJESTIC TREES OVERHEAD LEANING OVER THE BRINK LIKE LISTENERS EAGER TO CATCH EVERY WORD OF THE WHITE REFRESHING WATERS
4406-16882-0000 BELONGING TO OUR GARRISON BUT NONE OF THEM WOULD STIR THOUGH ANOTHER TIME IF ANY INDIAN HAD COME TO THE DOOR THEY WERE READY TO FLY UPON HIM AND TEAR HIM DOWN THE LORD HEREBY WOULD MAKE US THE MORE ACKNOWLEDGE HIS HAND AND TO SEE THAT OUR HELP IS ALWAYS IN HIM
4406-16882-0002 IN OR NEAR THE THROAT FELL DOWN DEAD WHEREAT THE INDIANS SCORNFULLY SHOUTED AND HALLOWED AND WERE PRESENTLY UPON HIM STRIPPING OFF HIS CLOTHES THE BULLETS FLYING THICK ONE WENT THROUGH MY SIDE AND THE SAME AS WOULD SEEM
4406-16882-0003 THROUGH THE BOWELS AND HAND OF MY DEAR CHILD IN MY ARMS ONE OF MY ELDER SISTERS CHILDREN NAMED WILLIAM HAD THEN HIS LEG BROKEN WHICH THE INDIANS PERCEIVING THEY KNOCKED HIM ON HIS HEAD
4406-16882-0005 AND HER ELDER SON TELLING HER THAT HER SON WILLIAM WAS DEAD AND MYSELF WAS WOUNDED SHE SAID AND LORD LET ME DIE WITH THEM WHICH WAS NO SOONER SAID BUT SHE WAS STRUCK WITH A BULLET AND FELL DOWN DEAD OVER THE THRESHOLD
4406-16882-0006 I HOPE SHE IS REAPING THE FRUIT OF HER GOOD LABORS BEING FAITHFUL TO THE SERVICE OF GOD IN HER PLACE IN HER YOUNGER YEARS SHE LAY UNDER MUCH TROUBLE UPON SPIRITUAL ACCOUNTS TILL IT PLEASED GOD TO MAKE THAT PRECIOUS SCRIPTURE TAKE HOLD OF HER HEART AND HE SAID UNTO ME
4406-16882-0008 AND RELATIONS LIE BLEEDING OUT THEIR HEART BLOOD UPON THE GROUND THERE WAS ONE WHO WAS CHOPPED INTO THE HEAD WITH A HATCHET AND STRIPPED NAKED
4406-16882-0009 AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TORN OUR VERY HEARTS OUT YET THE LORD BY HIS ALMIGHTY POWER PRESERVED A NUMBER OF US FROM DEATH FOR THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR OF US TAKEN ALIVE AND CARRIED CAPTIVE I HAD OFTEN BEFORE THIS SAID THAT IF THE INDIANS SHOULD COME
4406-16882-0011 THAN THAT MOMENT TO END MY DAYS AND THAT I MAY THE BETTER DECLARE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME DURING THAT GRIEVOUS CAPTIVITY I SHALL PARTICULARLY SPEAK OF THE SEVERAL REMOVES WE HAD UP AND DOWN THE WILDERNESS THE FIRST REMOVE NOW AWAY WE MUST GO WITH THOSE BARBAROUS CREATURES
4406-16882-0012 WITH OUR BODIES WOUNDED AND BLEEDING AND OUR HEARTS NO LESS THAN OUR BODIES ABOUT A MILE WE WENT THAT NIGHT UP UPON A HILL WITHIN SIGHT OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY INTENDED TO LODGE THERE WAS HARD BY A VACANT HOUSE DESERTED BY THE ENGLISH BEFORE FOR FEAR OF THE INDIANS
4406-16882-0014 SOME ROASTING SOME LYING AND BURNING AND SOME BOILING TO FEED OUR MERCILESS ENEMIES WHO WERE JOYFUL ENOUGH THOUGH WE WERE DISCONSOLATE
4406-16882-0015 AND THE DISMALNESS OF THE PRESENT NIGHT MY THOUGHTS RAN UPON MY LOSSES AND SAD BEREAVED CONDITION ALL WAS GONE MY HUSBAND GONE AT LEAST SEPARATED FROM ME HE BEING IN THE BAY AND TO ADD TO MY GRIEF THE INDIANS TOLD ME THEY WOULD KILL HIM AS HE CAME HOMEWARD
4406-16882-0017 AND IT SEEMED AT PRESENT WORSE THAN DEATH THAT IT WAS IN SUCH A PITIFUL CONDITION BESPEAKING COMPASSION AND I HAD NO REFRESHING FOR IT NOR SUITABLE THINGS TO REVIVE IT LITTLE DO MANY THINK WHAT IS THE SAVAGENESS AND BRUTISHNESS OF THIS BARBAROUS ENEMY

4406-16882-0021 AND CARRIED IT IN MY ARMS TILL MY STRENGTH FAILED AND I FELL DOWN WITH IT THEN THEY SET ME UPON A HORSE WITH MY WOUNDED CHILD IN MY LAP AND THERE BEING NO FURNITURE UPON THE HORSE'S BACK AS WE WERE GOING DOWN A STEEP HILL WE BOTH FELL OVER THE HORSE'S HEAD
4406-16882-0023 BY A LITTLE FIRE AND A FEW BOUGHS BEHIND ME WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY LAP
4406-16882-0024 MY OWN WOUND ALSO GROWING SO STIFF THAT I COULD SCARCE SIT DOWN OR RISE UP YET SO IT MUST BE THAT I MUST SIT ALL THIS COLD WINTER NIGHT UPON THE COLD SNOWY GROUND WITH MY SICK CHILD IN MY ARMS
4406-16882-0026 ONE OF THE INDIANS GOT UP UPON A HORSE AND THEY SET ME UP BEHIND HIM WITH MY POOR SICK BABE IN MY LAP A VERY WEARISOME AND TEDIOUS DAY I HAD OF IT WHAT WITH MY OWN WOUND AND MY CHILD'S BEING SO EXCEEDING SICK AND IN A LAMENTABLE CONDITION WITH HER WOUND
4406-16882-0027 THIS DAY IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT AN HOUR BY SUN
4406-16882-0029 IN THIS MISERABLE CONDITION WITHOUT ANY REFRESHING OF ONE NATURE OR OTHER EXCEPT A LITTLE COLD WATER I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE HOW AT ANOTHER TIME I COULD NOT BEAR TO BE IN THE ROOM WHERE ANY DEAD PERSON WAS
4406-16882-0030 BY MY MASTER IN THIS WRITING MUST BE UNDERSTOOD QUINNAPIN WHO WAS A SAGAMORE AND MARRIED KING PHILIP'S WIFE'S SISTER NOT THAT HE FIRST TOOK ME BUT I WAS SOLD TO HIM BY ANOTHER NARRAGANSETT INDIAN WHO TOOK ME WHEN FIRST I CAME OUT OF THE GARRISON
4406-16882-0032 WHEN I CAME I ASKED THEM WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH IT THEN THEY TOLD ME IT WAS UPON THE HILL
4406-16882-0033 AND THERE THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD BURIED IT
4406-16882-0035 SHE WAS ABOUT TEN YEARS OLD AND TAKEN FROM THE DOOR AT FIRST BY A PRAYING INDIANA AND AFTERWARD SOLD FOR A GUN
4406-16882-0036 AND YE WILL TAKE BENJAMIN ALSO ALL THESE THINGS ARE AGAINST ME
4406-16882-0038 I HAD NOT SEEN HIM BEFORE SINCE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TOWN AND I KNEW NOT WHERE HE WAS TILL I WAS INFORMED BY HIMSELF THAT HE WAS AMONGST A SMALLER PARCEL OF INDIANS WHOSE PLACE WAS ABOUT SIX MILES OFF WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES HE ASKED ME WHETHER HIS SISTER SARAH WAS DEAD
4406-16882-0039 AND TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN HIS SISTER MARY AND PRAYED ME THAT I WOULD NOT BE TROUBLED IN REFERENCE TO HIMSELF THE OCCASION OF HIS COMING TO SEE ME AT THIS TIME WAS THIS THERE WAS AS I SAID ABOUT SIX MILES FROM US A SMALL PLANTATION OF INDIANS WHERE IT SEEMS HE HAD BEEN DURING HIS CAPTIVITY
4406-16882-0041 BY THEIR NOISE AND HOOPING THEY SIGNIFIED HOW MANY THEY HAD DESTROYED WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME TWENTY THREE
4406-16882-0042 AND EVERY TIME THAT THE OTHER WENT OVER THEIR NUMBER THESE AT HOME GAVE A SHOUT THAT THE VERY EARTH RUNG AGAIN AND THUS THEY CONTINUED TILL THOSE THAT HAD BEEN UPON THE EXPEDITION WERE COME UP TO THE SAGAMORE'S WIGWAM AND THEN
4406-16882-0044 AND TURN ALL THOSE CURSES UPON OUR ENEMIES I DO NOT DESIRE TO LIVE TO FORGET THIS SCRIPTURE AND WHAT COMFORT IT WAS TO ME NOW
4406-16882-0045 SOME ONE WAY AND SOME ANOTHER THERE WERE NOW BESIDES MYSELF NINE ENGLISH CAPTIVES IN THIS PLACE ALL OF THEM CHILDREN EXCEPT ONE WOMAN
4406-16882-0047 I WISHED HER NOT TO RUN AWAY BY ANY MEANS FOR WE WERE NEAR THIRTY MILES FROM ANY ENGLISH TOWN
4406-16882-0048 AND ANOTHER CHILD IN HER ARMS TWO YEARS OLD AND BAD RIVERS THERE WERE TO GO OVER AND WE WERE FEEBLE WITH OUR POOR AND COARSE ENTERTAINMENT I HAD MY BIBLE WITH ME I PULLED IT OUT AND ASKED HER WHETHER SHE WOULD READ
4406-16882-0050 SHE WOULD BE OFTEN ASKING THE INDIANS TO LET HER GO HOME THEY NOT BEING WILLING TO THAT AND YET VEXED WITH HER IMPORTUNITY GATHERED A GREAT COMPANY TOGETHER ABOUT HER AND STRIPPED HER NAKED AND SET HER IN THE MIDST OF THEM AND WHEN THEY HAD SUNG AND DANCED ABOUT HER IN THEIR HELLISH MANNER
4406-16882-0051 AS LONG AS THEY PLEASED THEY KNOCKED HER ON HEAD AND THE CHILD IN HER ARMS WITH HER WHEN THEY HAD DONE THAT THEY MADE A FIRE AND PUT THEM BOTH INTO IT
4406-16882-0053 WE CAME ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON TO THIS PLACE COLD AND WET AND SNOWY AND HUNGRY AND WEARY AND NO REFRESHING FOR MAN BUT THE COLD GROUND TO SIT ON AND OUR POOR INDIAN CHEER
4406-16882-0054 THIS WAS A SWEET CORDIAL TO ME WHEN I WAS READY TO FAINT MANY AND MANY A TIME HAVE I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SWEETLY OVER THIS SCRIPTURE AT THIS PLACE WE CONTINUED ABOUT FOUR DAYS THE FIFTH REMOVE
4406-16882-0056 SOME CARRIED ONE AND SOME ANOTHER FOUR OF THEM CARRIED A GREAT INDIAN UPON A BIER BUT GOING THROUGH A THICK WOOD WITH HIM THEY WERE HINDERED AND COULD MAKE NO HASTE WHEREUPON THEY TOOK HIM UPON THEIR BACKS AND CARRIED HIM ONE AT A TIME TILL
4406-16882-0057 UPON A FRIDAY A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE CAME TO THIS RIVER
4406-16882-0059 BEING VERY FAINT I ASKED MY MISTRESS TO GIVE ME ONE SPOONFUL OF THE MEAL BUT SHE WOULD NOT GIVE ME A TASTE THEY QUICKLY FELL TO CUTTING DRY TREES TO MAKE RAFTS TO CARRY THEM OVER THE RIVER AND SOON MY TURN CAME TO GO OVER BY THE ADVANTAGE OF SOME BRUSH
4406-16882-0060 WHICH THEY HAD LAID UPON THE RAFT TO SIT UPON I DID NOT WET MY FOOT WHICH MANY OF THEMSELVES AT THE OTHER END WERE MID LEG DEEP WHICH CANNOT BUT BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FAVOR OF GOD TO MY WEAKENED BODY IT BEING A VERY COLD TIME I WAS NOT BEFORE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH
4406-16882-0062 I TOLD THEM IT WAS THE SABBATH DAY AND DESIRED THEM TO LET ME REST AND TOLD THEM I WOULD DO AS MUCH MORE TOMORROW TO WHICH THEY ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD BREAK MY FACE AND HERE I CANNOT BUT TAKE NOTICE OF THE STRANGE PROVIDENCE OF GOD IN PRESERVING THE HEATHEN
4406-16882-0063 THEY WERE MANY HUNDREDS OLD AND YOUNG SOME SICK AND SOME LAME MANY HAD PAPOOSES AT THEIR BACKS THE GREATEST NUMBER AT THIS TIME WITH US WERE SQUAWS
4406-16882-0065 THEY SET THEIR WIGWAMS ON FIRE AND WENT AWAY IT WAS A COLD MORNING AND BEFORE US THERE WAS A GREAT BROOK WITH ICE ON IT SOME WADED THROUGH IT UP TO THE KNEES AND HIGHER BUT OTHERS WENT TILL THEY CAME TO A BEAVER DAM AND I AMONGST THEM
4406-16882-0066 WE CAME THAT DAY TO A GREAT SWAMP BY THE SIDE OF WHICH WE TOOK UP OUR LODGING THAT NIGHT WHEN I CAME TO THE BROW OF THE HILL THAT LOOKED TOWARD THE SWAMP I THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN COME TO A GREAT INDIAN TOWN
4406-16882-0068 AND AN EXCEEDING HIGH AND STEEP HILL BEFORE IT BEFORE I GOT TO THE TOP OF THE HILL I THOUGHT MY HEART AND LEGS AND ALL WOULD HAVE BROKEN AND FAILED ME WHAT THROUGH FAINTNESS AND SORENESS OF BODY IT WAS A GRIEVOUS DAY OF TRAVEL TO ME
4406-16883-0000 AND THE CHANGE THAT HAD COME UPON US WE HAD HUSBAND AND FATHER AND CHILDREN AND SISTERS AND FRIENDS AND RELATIONS AND HOUSE AND HOME AND MANY COMFORTS OF THIS LIFE BUT NOW WE MAY SAY AS JOB
4406-16883-0002 EVEN AS THE PSALMIST SAYS TO DECLARE THE WORKS OF THE LORD AND HIS WONDERFUL POWER IN CARRYING US ALONG PRESERVING US IN THE WILDERNESS WHILE UNDER THE ENEMY'S HAND AND RETURNING OF US IN SAFETY AGAIN AND HIS GOODNESS
4406-16883-0003 IN BRINGING TO MY HAND SO MANY COMFORTABLE AND SUITABLE SCRIPTURES IN MY DISTRESS BUT TO RETURN
4406-16883-0005 WHICH WAS THE FIRST TIME TO MY REMEMBRANCE THAT I WEPT BEFORE THEM ALTHOUGH I HAD MET WITH SO MUCH AFFLICTION AND MY HEART WAS MANY TIMES READY TO BREAK YET COULD I NOT SHED ONE TEAR IN THEIR SIGHT BUT RATHER
4406-16883-0006 BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON THERE WE SATE DOWN
4406-16883-0008 AND ASKED ME WHETHER I WOULD SMOKE IT A USUAL COMPLIMENT NOWADAYS AMONGST SAINTS AND SINNERS BUT THIS NO WAY SUITED ME FOR THOUGH I HAD FORMERLY USED TOBACCO YET I HAD LEFT IT EVER SINCE I WAS FIRST TAKEN
4406-16883-0009 IT SEEMS TO BE A BAIT THE DEVIL LAYS TO MAKE MEN LOSE THEIR PRECIOUS TIME
4406-16883-0011 WHEREUPON THEY FELL TO BOILING OF GROUND NUTS AND PARCHING OF CORN
4406-16883-0012 DURING MY ABODE IN THIS PLACE PHILIP SPAKE TO ME TO MAKE A SHIRT FOR HIS BOY WHICH I DID FOR WHICH HE GAVE ME A SHILLING I OFFERED THE MONEY TO MY MASTER BUT HE BADE ME KEEP IT AND WITH IT I BOUGHT A PIECE OF HORSE FLESH
4406-16883-0014 AND BEAR TOGETHER AND INVITED MY MASTER AND MISTRESS TO DINNER BUT THE PROUD GOSSIP BECAUSE I SERVED THEM BOTH IN ONE DISH WOULD EAT NOTHING EXCEPT ONE BIT THAT HE GAVE HER UPON THE POINT OF HIS KNIFE
4406-16883-0015 HEARING THAT MY SON WAS COME TO THIS PLACE I WENT TO SEE HIM AND FOUND HIM LYING FLAT UPON THE GROUND I ASKED HIM HOW HE COULD SLEEP SO HE ANSWERED ME THAT HE WAS NOT ASLEEP BUT AT PRAYER AND LAY SO THAT THEY MIGHT NOT OBSERVE WHAT HE WAS DOING
4406-16883-0017 WHO OWNED THAT MARY THURSTON CAME RUNNING AFTER ME AND GOT IT AWAY AGAIN
4406-16883-0018 I PUT IT IN MY POCKET TO KEEP IT SAFE YET NOTWITHSTANDING SOMEBODY STOLE IT BUT PUT FIVE INDIAN CORNS IN THE ROOM OF IT WHICH CORNS WERE THE GREATEST PROVISIONS I HAD IN MY TRAVEL FOR ONE DAY
4406-16883-0020 BUT INSTEAD OF GOING EITHER TO ALBANY OR HOMEWARD WE MUST GO FIVE MILES UP THE RIVER AND THEN GO OVER IT HERE WE ABODE A WHILE HERE LIVED A SORRY INDIAN WHO SPOKE TO ME TO MAKE HIM A SHIRT WHEN I HAD DONE IT HE WOULD PAY ME NOTHING
4406-16883-0021 BUT HE LIVING BY THE RIVERSIDE WHERE I OFTEN WENT TO FETCH WATER I WOULD OFTEN BE PUTTING OF HIM IN MIND AND CALLING FOR MY PAY AT LAST HE TOLD ME IF I WOULD MAKE ANOTHER SHIRT FOR A PAPOOSE NOT YET BORN HE WOULD GIVE ME A KNIFE WHICH HE DID WHEN I HAD DONE IT
4406-16883-0023 WHERE THEY HAD STORED UP SOME IN THE GROUND
4406-16883-0024 I TURNED HOMEWARD AGAIN AND MET WITH MY MASTER HE SHOWED ME THE WAY TO MY SON WHEN I CAME TO HIM I FOUND HIM NOT WELL AND WITHALL HE HAD A BOIL ON HIS SIDE WHICH MUCH TROUBLED HIM WE BEMOANED ONE ANOTHER A WHILE AS THE LORD HELPED US
4406-16883-0026 MY SON WAS ILL AND I COULD NOT BUT THINK OF HIS MOURNFUL LOOKS AND NO CHRISTIAN FRIEND WAS NEAR HIM TO DO ANY OFFICE OF LOVE FOR HIM EITHER FOR SOUL OR BODY AND MY POOR GIRL I KNEW NOT WHERE SHE WAS NOR WHETHER SHE WAS SICK OR WELL OR ALIVE OR DEAD
4406-16883-0027 I REPAIRED UNDER THESE THOUGHTS TO MY BIBLE MY GREAT COMFORT IN THAT TIME AND THAT SCRIPTURE CAME TO MY HAND CAST THY BURDEN UPON THE LORD AND HE SHALL SUSTAIN THEE PSALM FIFTY FIVE
4406-16883-0029 BUT NOW THAT WAS SAVORY TO ME THAT ONE WOULD THINK WAS ENOUGH TO TURN THE STOMACH OF A BRUTE CREATURE ONE BITTER COLD DAY I COULD FIND NO ROOM TO SIT DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
4406-16883-0030 AND GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS AND BADE ME COME AGAIN AND TOLD ME THEY WOULD BUY ME IF THEY WERE ABLE AND YET THESE WERE STRANGERS TO ME THAT I NEVER SAW BEFORE THE TENTH REMOVE
4406-16883-0032 I LIFTED UP MY HEART TO GOD HOPING THE REDEMPTION WAS NOT FAR OFF AND THE RATHER BECAUSE THEIR INSOLENCY GREW WORSE AND WORSE BUT THE THOUGHTS OF MY GOING HOMEWARD FOR SO WE BENT OUR COURSE
4406-16883-0033 MUCH CHEERED MY SPIRIT AND MADE MY BURDEN SEEM LIGHT AND ALMOST NOTHING AT ALL BUT TO MY AMAZEMENT AND GREAT PERPLEXITY THE SCALE WAS SOON TURNED FOR WHEN WE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY ON A SUDDEN MY MISTRESS GIVES OUT
4406-16883-0035 BE STILL AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD PSALM FORTY SIX
4406-16883-0036 WHICH WERE SOME REFRESHMENT TO ME TOWARDS NIGHT I GATHERED SOME STICKS FOR MY OWN COMFORT THAT I MIGHT NOT LIE A COLD BUT WHEN WE CAME TO LIE DOWN THEY BADE ME TO GO OUT AND LIE SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR THEY HAD COMPANY THEY SAID COME IN MORE THAN THEIR OWN
4406-16883-0038 WAS I FAIN TO STOOP TO THIS RUDE FELLOW AND TO GO OUT IN THE NIGHT I KNEW NOT WHITHER MINE EYES HAVE SEEN THAT FELLOW AFTERWARDS WALKING UP AND DOWN BOSTON UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF A FRIEND INDIAN AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF THE LIKE CUT
4406-16883-0039 I WENT TO ONE WIGWAM AND THEY TOLD ME THEY HAD NO ROOM THEN I WENT TO ANOTHER AND THEY SAID THE SAME AT LAST AN OLD INDIAN BADE ME TO COME TO HIM AND HIS SQUAW GAVE ME SOME GROUND NUTS
4406-16883-0041 WE WENT IN THE MORNING TO GATHER GROUND NUTS TO THE RIVER AND WENT BACK AGAIN THAT NIGHT I WENT WITH A GOOD LOAD AT MY BACK FOR THEY WHEN THEY WENT THOUGH BUT A LITTLE WAY WOULD CARRY ALL THEIR TRUMPERY WITH THEM I TOLD THEM THE SKIN WAS OFF MY BACK
4406-16883-0042 BUT I HAD NO OTHER COMFORTING ANSWER FROM THEM THAN THIS THAT IT WOULD BE NO MATTER IF MY HEAD WERE OFF TOO THE THIRTEENTH REMOVE INSTEAD OF GOING TOWARD THE BAY WHICH WAS THAT I DESIRED
4406-16883-0044 AND A FEW ROASTED GROUND NUTS I HAD NOT SEEN MY SON A PRETTY WHILE
4406-16883-0045 AND ASKED HIM WHEN HE SAW HIM HE ANSWERED ME THAT SUCH A TIME HIS MASTER ROASTED HIM
4406-16883-0047 THAT MAKES THE LEAST CONSCIENCE OF SPEAKING OF TRUTH IN THIS PLACE ON A COLD NIGHT AS I LAY BY THE FIRE I REMOVED A STICK THAT KEPT THE HEAT FROM ME
4406-16883-0048 YET UPON THIS AND THE LIKE OCCASIONS I HOPE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY WITH JOB
4406-16883-0050 BUT HE WIST NOT THAT THE LORD WAS DEPARTED FROM HIM ABOUT THIS TIME I BEGAN TO THINK THAT ALL MY HOPES OF RESTORATION WOULD COME TO NOTHING I THOUGHT OF THE ENGLISH ARMY AND HOPED FOR THEIR COMING AND BEING TAKEN BY THEM BUT THAT FAILED
4406-16883-0051 I HOPED TO BE CARRIED TO ALBANY AS THE INDIANS HAD DISCOURSED BEFORE BUT THAT FAILED ALSO I THOUGHT OF BEING SOLD TO MY HUSBAND
4406-16883-0053 THEY ALL GATHERED ABOUT THE POOR MAN ASKING HIM MANY QUESTIONS I DESIRED ALSO TO GO AND SEE HIM AND WHEN I CAME HE WAS CRYING BITTERLY SUPPOSING THEY WOULD QUICKLY KILL HIM WHEREUPON I ASKED ONE OF THEM WHETHER THEY INTENDED TO KILL HIM HE ANSWERED ME THEY WOULD NOT
4406-16883-0054 HE BEING A LITTLE CHEERED WITH THAT I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE WELFARE OF MY HUSBAND HE TOLD ME HE SAW HIM SUCH A TIME IN THE BAY AND HE WAS WELL BUT VERY MELANCHOLY BY WHICH I CERTAINLY UNDERSTOOD THOUGH I SUSPECTED IT BEFORE
4406-16883-0056 AND THAT ALL PERSUADED I WAS DEAD SO LIKE WERE THESE BARBAROUS CREATURES TO HIM WHO WAS A LIAR FROM THE BEGINNING AS I WAS SITTING ONCE IN THE WIGWAM HERE PHILIP'S MAID CAME IN WITH THE CHILD IN HER ARMS
4406-16883-0057 I TOLD HER I WOULD TEAR HER COAT THEN WITH THAT MY MISTRESS RISES UP
4406-16883-0059 THAN IT PROVED TO BE IN HIS REMAINING WITH THE INDIANS I WENT TO SEE AN ENGLISH YOUTH IN THIS PLACE
4406-16883-0060 HE TOLD ME HE WAS VERY SICK OF A FLUX WITH EATING SO MUCH BLOOD THEY HAD TURNED HIM OUT OF THE WIGWAM AND WITH HIM AN INDIAN PAPOOSE ALMOST DEAD WHOSE PARENTS HAD BEEN KILLED
4441-76250-0001 HE WAS CONTRARY TO HIS CUSTOM NOT IN DRESSING GOWN AND SLIPPERS AND HIS WIFE WAS WEARING AN EXPENSIVE MORNING GOWN YES THEY WERE ALL HERE YESTERDAY SAID MISSUS FALK LAUGHING GAILY ALL FIVE OF THEM

4441-76250-0005 IS THAT SO YES AND THEY WERE IMPERTINENT ENOUGH TO SAY THAT I HAD NO LONGER ANY REASON TO BE STUCK UP PROUD OLD GIRL THEY SAID STUCK UP PERSONALLY I SHOULD NEVER HAVE CONDESCENDED

4441-76263-0001 AND MOREOVER THERE WERE SO MANY YOUNGER MEMBERS OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREATER NEED OF IT BUT HE WAS MADE TO REALIZE THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE SUN EXTINGUISHED BUT THAT THE SMALLER PLANETS TOO SUFFERED FROM TOTAL ECLIPSE HE HAD WORKED STRENUOUSLY DURING THE SUMMER
4441-76263-0003 DID NOT WANT LANDSCAPES BUT PORTRAITS OF THE WATERING PLACES AND SUMMER RESORTS THEY KNEW AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SELL EVEN THESE THE ONLY DEMAND WAS FOR SENTIMENTAL GENRE PICTURES AND HALF NUDE FIGURES
4441-76263-0004 THEREFORE SELLEN HAD FALLEN ON EVIL DAYS FOR HE COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO PAINT AGAINST HIS BETTER JUDGMENT HE WAS NOW RENTING A FORMER PHOTOGRAPHIC STUDIO ON THE TOP OF A HOUSE IN GOVERNMENT STREET THE ACCOMMODATION CONSISTED OF THE STUDIO ITSELF
4441-76263-0006 WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THE PURCHASE OF FUEL THE ONLY PIECE OF FURNITURE WAS A WOODEN GARDEN SEAT STUDDED WITH PROTRUDING NAILS IT WAS SO SHORT THAT A MAN USING IT AS A BED

4441-76263-0009 ON A COLD AFTERNOON A SHORT TIME BEFORE CHRISTMAS SELLEN WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS EASEL PAINTING FOR THE THIRD TIME A NEW PICTURE ON AN OLD CANVAS HE HAD JUST RISEN FROM HIS HARD BED NO SERVANT HAD COME IN TO LIGHT HIS FIRE
4441-76263-0010 PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAD NO SERVANT AND PARTLY BECAUSE HE HAD NOTHING WITH WHICH TO MAKE A FIRE NO SERVANT HAD BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES OR BROUGHT HIS COFFEE AND YET HE WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS EASEL WHISTLING MERRILY ENGAGED IN PAINTING A BRILLIANT SUNSET WHEN THERE CAME FOUR KNOCKS AT THE DOOR

4441-76263-0046 THE LATTER STAGGERED TO THE FIRE LAY DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CURLED HIMSELF UP LIKE A DOG FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOBODY SPOKE
4481-17498-0000 THE AUTHOR IS PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT A SEQUEL TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES THE BOOK WHICH WAS RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH FAVOR LAST YEAR YET IT IS NOT NECESSARY ONE SHOULD HAVE READ THE FIRST BOOK TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT VOLUME
4481-17498-0001 THE CHARACTERS BEING TAKEN TO ENTIRELY NEW SCENES THE VARIOUS FOREIGN LOCALITIES ARE ACCURATELY DESCRIBED
4481-17498-0003 LEST I BE ACCUSED OF UNDUE SENSATIONALISM IN RELATING THE SOMEWHAT DRAMATIC SICILIAN INCIDENT I WILL ASSURE MY READER THAT THE STORY DOES NOT EXAGGERATE PRESENT CONDITIONS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE ISLAND IN FACT IL DUCA AND TATO
4481-17498-0004 ARE DRAWN FROM LIFE ALTHOUGH THEY DID NOT HAVE THEIR MOUNTAIN LAIR SO NEAR TO TAORMINA AS I HAVE VENTURED TO LOCATE IT EXCEPT THAT I HAVE ADAPTED THEIR CLEVER SYSTEM OF BRIGANDAGE TO THE EXIGENCIES OF THIS STORY THEIR HISTORY IS TRULY RELATED
4481-17498-0006 OR IN SYMPATHY WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE WORK OF REFORMATION IS NECESSARILY SLOW AMERICANS ESPECIALLY MUST EXERCISE CAUTION IN TRAVELLING IN ANY PART OF SICILY YET WITH PROPER CARE NOT TO TEMPT THE IRRESPONSIBLE NATIVES
4481-17498-0007 THEY ARE AS SAFE IN SICILY AS THEY ARE AT HOME AUNT JANE'S NIECES ARE SHOWN TO BE AS FRANKLY ADVENTUROUS AS THE AVERAGE CLEAR HEADED AMERICAN GIRL BUT THEIR EXPERIENCES AMID THE ENVIRONMENTS OF AN ANCIENT AND STILL PRIMITIVE CIVILIZATION ARE IN NO WISE EXTRAORDINARY
4481-17498-0009 WAS SEATED AT THE PIANO SOFTLY PLAYING THE ONE PIECE THE MUSIC TEACHER HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRILLING INTO HER FLIGHTY HEAD BY VIRTUE OF MUCH PATIENCE AND PERSEVERANCE IN A THICK CUSHIONED MORRIS CHAIR RECLINED THE MOTIONLESS FORM OF UNCLE JOHN
4481-17498-0010 A CHUBBY LITTLE MAN IN A GRAY SUIT WHOSE FEATURES WERE TEMPORARILY ECLIPSED BY THE NEWSPAPER THAT WAS SPREAD CAREFULLY OVER THEM OCCASIONALLY A GASP OR A SNORE FROM BENEATH THE PAPER SUGGESTED THAT THE LITTLE MAN WAS SNOOZING
4481-17498-0012 NODDING HIS GRIZZLED HEAD TO MARK THE TIME AS WELL AS TO EMPHASIZE HIS EVIDENT APPROBATION PATSY HAD PLAYED THIS SAME PIECE FROM START TO FINISH SEVEN TIMES SINCE DINNER BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY ONE SHE KNEW
4481-17498-0013 BUT THE MAJOR COULD HAVE LISTENED TO IT SEVEN HUNDRED TIMES WITHOUT THE FLICKER OF AN EYELASH IT WAS NOT THAT HE ADMIRED SO MUCH THE PIECE THE GIRL WAS PLAYING AS THE GIRL WHO WAS PLAYING THE PIECE HIS PRIDE IN PATSY WAS UNBOUNDED
4481-17498-0015 AND SAT BOLT UPRIGHT GAZING AT HIS COMPANIONS WITH A STARTLED LOOK THAT MELTED INTO ONE OF BENIGN COMPLACENCY AS HE OBSERVED HIS SURROUNDINGS AND REALIZED WHERE HE WAS THE INTERRUPTION GAVE PATSY AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOP PLAYING THE TUNE
4481-17498-0016 SHE SWUNG AROUND ON THE STOOL AND LOOKED WITH AMUSEMENT AT HER NEWLY AWAKENED UNCLE YOU'VE BEEN ASLEEP SHE SAID NO INDEED QUITE A MISTAKE REPLIED THE LITTLE MAN SERIOUSLY I'VE ONLY BEEN THINKING
4481-17498-0018 YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE UP EATING THE SALAD SIR BAH DON'T I KNOW ASKED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WELL IF YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS BETTER THAN OUR HEARING I SUPPOSE YOU DO RETORTED THE MAJOR BUT TO AN IGNORANT INDIVIDUAL LIKE MESELF
4481-17498-0019 THE IMPRESSION CONVEYED WAS THAT YOU SNORED LIKE A MAN THAT HAS FORGOTTEN HIS MANNERS AN GONE TO SLEEP IN THE PRISENCE OF A LADY THEN NO ONE HAS A BETTER RIGHT TO DO THAT DECLARED PATSY SOOTHINGLY AND I'M SURE OUR DEAR UNCLE JOHN'S THOUGHTS
4481-17498-0021 I'M GOING TO EUROPE HE SAID THE MAJOR GAVE AN INVOLUNTARY START AND THEN TURNED TO LOOK AT HIM CURIOUSLY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE PATSY ALONG HE CONTINUED WITH A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN THE MAJOR FROWNED
4481-17498-0022 YOU'RE DREAMING AGAIN PATSY SWUNG HER FEET FROM SIDE TO SIDE FOR SHE WAS SUCH A LITTLE THING THAT THE STOOL RAISED HER ENTIRELY OFF THE FLOOR THERE WAS A THOUGHTFUL LOOK ON HER ROUND FRECKLED FACE AND A WISTFUL ONE IN HER GREAT BLUE EYES
4481-17498-0024 AND THEN CARRY IT OUT IN SPITE OF ALL OPPOSITION BUT TO TAKE PATSY TO EUROPE WOULD BE LIKE PULLING THE MAJOR'S EYE TEETH OR AMPUTATING HIS GOOD RIGHT ARM WORSE FAR WORSE IT WOULD MEAN TAKING THE SUNSHINE OUT OF HER OLD FATHER'S SKY ALTOGETHER
4481-17498-0025 AND PAINTING IT A GRIM DESPAIRING GRAY BUT HE RESOLVED NOT TO SUBMIT WITHOUT A STRUGGLE SIR SAID HE STERNLY HE ALWAYS CALLED HIS BROTHER IN LAW SIR WHEN HE WAS IN A SARCASTIC OR REPROACHFUL MOOD I'VE HAD AN IDEA FOR SOME TIME THAT YOU WERE PLOTTING MISCHIEF
4481-17498-0027 THE GRIZZLED OLD IRISHMAN HAD BEEN AS TENDER TOWARD HIM AS A WOMAN AND STUDIOUSLY AVOIDED ANY SPEECH OR EPITHET THAT BY CHANCE MIGHT INJURE THE FEELINGS OF HIS DEAD WIFE'S ONLY BROTHER BUT THE MAJOR'S INVARIABLE COURTESY TO THE POOR OR UNFORTUNATE
4481-17498-0028 WAS NO LONGER IN EVIDENCE WHEN HE FOUND THAT JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE WITH A STRONGLY DEFINED HABIT OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS AND STRIVING IN OBSCURE AND UNCONVENTIONAL WAYS TO MAKE EVERYBODY AROUND HIM HAPPY
4481-17498-0030 AND HOLDING THE DIGNIFIED MAJOR IN LOVING REGARD WAS GLAD TO CROSS SWORDS WITH HIM NOW AND THEN TO ADD VARIETY TO THEIR PLEASANT RELATIONS IT'S THIS WAY MAJOR DOYLE HE NOW REMARKED COOLLY
4481-17498-0031 YOU'VE NO WORRY AT ALL WHY WE'VE JUST MADE YOU A QUARTER OF A MILLION IN C H AND D'S THE WE IS EXPLAINED BY STATING THAT THE MAJOR HELD AN IMPORTANT POSITION IN THE GREAT BANKING HOUSE A POSITION MISTER MERRICK HAD SECURED FOR HIM SOME MONTHS PREVIOUSLY
4481-17498-0033 AND THE RESULT IS AN ACCUMULATION OF ALL THIS DREADFUL MONEY SO MY DEAR MAJOR
4481-17498-0034 AND WHERE BY INDUSTRY AND PERSEVERANCE I CAN SCATTER SOME OF MY ILL GOTTEN GAINS THE MAJOR SMILED GRIMLY THAT'S EUROPE RIGHT ENOUGH HE SAID AND I DON'T OBJECT JOHN TO YOUR GOING THERE WHENEVER YOU PLEASE YOU'RE DISGRACEFULLY COUNTRYFIED
4481-17498-0036 AND GO WHINEVER YOU PLEASE SOR BUT FORBEAR THE WICKEDNESS OF PUTTING FOOLISH THOUGHTS INTO OUR PATSY'S SWEET HEAD SHE CAN'T GO A STEP AND YOU KNOW IT IT'S POSITIVE CRUELTY TO HER SIR TO SUGGEST SUCH A THING
4481-17498-0037 THE MAJOR'S SPEECH HAD A TOUCH OF THE BROGUE WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED BUT RECOVERED WHEN HE CALMED DOWN WHY YOU SELFISH OLD HUMBUG CRIED UNCLE JOHN INDIGNANTLY WHY CAN'T SHE GO WHEN THERE'S MONEY AND TIME TO SPARE
4481-17498-0039 OR HIS OATMEAL FOR BREAKFAST AND PATSY HAS THE HOUSE TO LOOK AFTER ADDED THE MAJOR COMPLACENTLY UNCLE JOHN GAVE A SNORT OF CONTEMPT FOR AN UNREASONABLE MAN SHOW ME AN IRISHMAN HE REMARKED
4481-17498-0040 HERE YOU'VE BEEN TELLING ME HOW EUROPE IS AN EDUCATION AND A DELIGHT AND IN THE NEXT BREATH YOU DELIBERATELY DEPRIVE YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER WHOM YOU PRETEND TO LOVE OF THE ADVANTAGES SHE MIGHT GAIN BY A TRIP ABROAD AND WHY JUST BECAUSE YOU WANT HER YOURSELF
4481-17498-0042 AND MISTER MARVIN HAS BEEN SO KIND AND CONSIDERATE THAT I WON'T PLAY HIM A DIRTY TRICK BY LEAVING HIM IN THE LURCH PATSY NODDED APPROVAL THAT'S RIGHT DADDY SHE SAID UNCLE JOHN LAY BACK IN THE CHAIR AND PUT THE NEWSPAPER OVER HIS FACE AGAIN
4481-17498-0043 THEN THE MAJOR DREW OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND MOPPED HIS BROW YOU'D LIKE TO GO MAVOURNEEN HE ASKED SOFTLY YES DADDY BUT I WON'T OF COURSE TUT TUT DON'T YOU GO PUTTING YOURSELF AGAINST YOUR OLD FATHER'S WILL PATSY IT'S NOT SO FAR TO EUROPE HE CONTINUED THOUGHTFULLY
4481-17498-0045 SHE WAS IN HIS LAP NOW HER CHUBBY ARMS CLASPED AROUND HIS NECK AND HER SOFT CHEEK LAID CLOSE BESIDE HIS ROUGH AND RUDDY ONE AND WHEN YE GET BACK PATSY DARLIN HE WHISPERED TENDERLY STROKING HER HAIR
4481-17498-0046 IT'S THE WAY OF LIFE MAVOURNEEN UNLESS A COUPLE HAPPENS TO BE SIAMESE TWINS THEY'RE BOUND TO GET SEPARATED IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS MORE OR LESS IF NOT FREQUENTLY I WON'T GO DADDY
4481-17498-0048 AND HE LOOKED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE ROUND LITTLE MAN UNDER THE NEWSPAPER UNCLE JOHN EMERGED AGAIN IT WAS WONDERFUL HOW WELL HE UNDERSTOOD THE DOYLE FAMILY HIS FACE WAS NOW SMILING AND WORE A LOOK OF SUPREME SATISFACTION
4481-17499-0000 UNCLE JOHN MAKES PLANS THE THOUGHT CAME TO ME A LONG TIME AGO UNCLE JOHN RESUMED BUT IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY THAT I GOT ALL THE DETAILS FIXED AND SETTLED IN MY MIND I'VE BEEN A ROUGH OLD DUFFER PATSY
4481-17499-0002 A SECRET YOU WERE TRYING TO KEEP FROM ME YOU CRAFTY YOUNG WOMAN UNTIL I DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT NOW HERE I AM WITH THREE NIECES ON MY HANDS YOU MAY SAY TWO SIR INTERRUPTED THE MAJOR PATSY CAN TAKE CARE OF HERSELF
4481-17499-0003 HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID UNCLE JOHN I SAY I'VE GOT THREE NIECES AS FINE A TRIO OF INTELLIGENT SWEET AND ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMEN AS YOU'LL RUN ACROSS IN A MONTH OF SUNDAYS I DARE YOU TO DENY IT SIR
4481-17499-0005 NOT YET HE SAID I'D FORGOTTEN TO MENTION IT TO THEM FOR MY PART CONTINUED THE GIRL I CAN GET READY IN A WEEK EASILY BUT BETH IS WAY OUT IN OHIO AND WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE CAN GO OR NOT I'LL TELEGRAPH HER AND FIND OUT SAID UNCLE JOHN
4481-17499-0006 DO IT TO DAY SUGGESTED THE MAJOR I WILL AND TO MORROW YOU MUST SEE LOUISE ADDED PATSY I'M NOT SURE SHE'LL WANT TO GO DEAR SHE'S SUCH A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY YOU KNOW THAT HER ENGAGEMENTS MAY KEEP HER AT HOME
4481-17499-0008 PERHAPS SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO BE SENSIBLE SUGGESTED THE MAJOR WELL I'LL SEE HER AND HER MOTHER TO MORROW MORNING DECIDED UNCLE JOHN
4481-17499-0009 YOU AND BETH SHALL GO ANYHOW AND WE'LL BRING LOUISE A WEDDING PRESENT WITH THIS DECLARATION HE TOOK HIS HAT AND WALKING STICK AND STARTED FOR THE TELEGRAPH STATION LEAVING PATSY AND HER FATHER TO CANVASS THE UNEXPECTED SITUATION
4481-17499-0011 WHO NEVER HAD CREDITED HIM WITH SUFFICIENT ABILITY TO EARN MORE THAN A PRECARIOUS LIVELIHOOD BUT THE MAN WAS SHREWD ENOUGH IN A BUSINESS WAY ALTHOUGH SIMPLE ALMOST TO CHILDISHNESS IN MANY OTHER MATTERS WHEN HE RETURNED QUITE UNHERALDED TO END HIS DAYS AT HOME
4481-17499-0012 AND EMPLOY HIS AMPLE WEALTH TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE HE FOR A TIME KEPT HIS SUCCESS A SECRET AND SO LEARNED MUCH OF THE DISPOSITIONS AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF HIS THREE NIECES THEY WERE AT THAT TIME VISITING HIS UNMARRIED SISTER JANE AT HER ESTATE AT ELMHURST
4481-17499-0014 PATSY PROVED THE ONE BRIGHT STAR IN THE FIRMAMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT SUPPOSING UNCLE JOHN TO BE POOR SHE INSISTED UPON CARRYING HIM TO NEW YORK WITH HER AND SHARING WITH HIM THE HUMBLE TENEMENT ROOM IN WHICH SHE LIVED WITH HER FATHER A RETIRED VETERAN WHO HELPED PAY THE FAMILY EXPENSES
4481-17499-0015 BY KEEPING BOOKS FOR A MERCANTILE FIRM WHILE PATSY WORKED IN A HAIR DRESSER'S SHOP IT WAS NOW THAT UNCLE JOHN PROVED A MODERN FAIRY GODFATHER TO AUNT JANE'S NIECES WHO WERE LIKEWISE HIS OWN NIECES THE THREE GIRLS HAD LITTLE IN COMMON EXCEPT THEIR POVERTY
4481-17499-0017 WHERE THE TWO WOMEN FRANKLY INTRIGUED TO ENSNARE FOR LOUISE A HUSBAND WHO HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS TO ENSURE BOTH MOTHER AND DAUGHTER A COMFORTABLE HOME IN SPITE OF THIS WORLDLY AND UNLOVELY AMBITION WHICH THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT PARTIALLY EXCUSE LOUISE
4481-17499-0018 WHO WAS BUT SEVENTEEN HAD MANY GOOD AND WOMANLY QUALITIES COULD THEY HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN ATMOSPHERE UNINFLUENCED BY THE SCHEMES OF HER VAIN AND SELFISH MOTHER UNCLE JOHN CASTING ASIDE THE MASK OF POVERTY CAME TO THE RELIEF OF ALL THREE GIRLS
4481-17499-0020 AND INSTALLED HER AND THE MAJOR IN ITS COSIEST APARTMENT THE RENTS OF THE REMAINING FLATS GIVING THE DOYLES AN ADEQUATE INCOME FOR ALL TIME TO COME HERE UNCLE JOHN BELIEVING HIMSELF CORDIALLY WELCOME AS INDEED HE WAS MADE HIS OWN HOME
4481-17499-0021 AND IT REQUIRED NO SHREWD GUESSING TO ARRIVE AT THE CONCLUSION THAT LITTLE PATSY WAS DESTINED TO INHERIT SOME DAY ALL HIS MILLIONS
4481-17499-0023 MONEY HAD NO POWER TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE DOYLES THE MAJOR REMAINED THE SAME SIMPLE HONEST COURTEOUS YET BRUSQUE OLD WARRIOR WHO HAD WON UNCLE JOHN'S LOVE AS A HARD WORKING BOOK KEEPER
4481-17499-0024 AND PATSY'S BRIGHT AND SUNNY DISPOSITION HAD CERTAIN POWER TO CHEER ANY HOME WHETHER LOCATED IN A PALACE OR A HOVEL NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD UNCLE JOHN BEEN SO SUPREMELY HAPPY
4481-17499-0026 PATSY LOUISE AND I SAIL FOR EUROPE NEXT TUESDAY WILL YOU JOIN US AS MY GUEST IF SO TAKE FIRST TRAIN TO NEW YORK WHERE I WILL LOOK AFTER YOUR OUTFIT ANSWER IMMEDIATELY THAT WAS A MESSAGE LIKELY TO SURPRISE A COUNTRY GIRL
4481-17499-0027 BUT IT DID NOT STRIKE JOHN MERRICK AS IN ANY WAY EXTRAORDINARY HE THOUGHT HE COULD DEPEND UPON BETH SHE WOULD BE AS EAGER TO GO AS HE WAS TO HAVE HER AND WHEN HE HAD PAID FOR THE TELEGRAM HE DISMISSED THE MATTER FROM FURTHER THOUGHT NEXT MORNING
4481-17499-0029 SIPPING HER COFFEE IN AN UPPER ROOM BUT SHE COULD NOT DENY HERSELF TO UNCLE JOHN HER DEAD HUSBAND'S BROTHER AND HER ONLY DAUGHTER'S BENEFACTOR WHICH MEANT INDIRECTLY HER OWN BENEFACTOR SO SHE ORDERED THE MAID TO SHOW HIM UP AT ONCE
4481-17499-0030 LOUISE IS STILL SWEETLY SLEEPING SHE SAID AND WON'T WAKEN FOR HOURS YET IS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HER HE ASKED ANXIOUSLY OH DEAR NO BUT EVERYONE DOES NOT GET UP WITH THE MILKMAN AS YOU DO JOHN
4481-17499-0032 AH YES HE RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY I'VE ALWAYS NOTICED THAT THE OPERA MAKES FOLKS DESPERATELY HUNGRY FOR THEY FLOCK TO THE RESTAURANTS AS SOON AS THEY CAN GET AWAY SINGULAR ISN'T IT WHY I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT IN THAT LIGHT
4481-17499-0033 BUT LOUISE IS WELL QUITE WELL THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF FOR I'M GOING TO TAKE HER TO EUROPE WITH ME NEXT WEEK HE SAID MISSUS MERRICK WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE NEARLY DROPPED HER COFFEE CUP
4481-17499-0035 IT WILL TAKE A MONTH AT LEAST TO MAKE HER GOWNS AND STUFF AND RUBBISH HE GROWLED THAT SHOWS MARTHA HOW LITTLE YOU KNOW ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIPS NO ONE MAKES GOWNS TO GO ABROAD WITH YOU BUY EM IN PARIS TO BRING HOME
4481-17499-0036 AH YES TO BE SURE SHE MUTTERED PERHAPS THEN IT CAN BE DONE IF LOUISE HAS NO OTHER ENGAGEMENTS JUST WHAT PATSY SAID SEE HERE MARTHA DO YOU IMAGINE THAT ANY GIRL WHO IS HALF HUMAN COULD HAVE ENGAGEMENTS THAT WOULD KEEP HER FROM EUROPE
4481-17499-0038 I'VE NO DOUBT LOUISE WILL BE DELIGHTED TO GO AND SO WILL I YOU WHY WHY WHOM DO YOU INTEND TAKING JUST THE THREE GIRLS AUNT JANE'S THREE NIECES ALSO MINE BUT YOU'LL WANT A CHAPERONE FOR THEM
4481-17499-0039 WHY SO PROPRIETY REQUIRES IT AND SO DOES ORDINARY PRUDENCE LOUISE I KNOW WILL BE DISCREET FOR IT IS HER NATURE BUT PATSY IS SUCH A LITTLE FLYAWAY
4481-17499-0041 THREE BETTER GIRLS NEVER LIVED AND I'LL TRUST EM ANYWHERE BESIDES THAT WE AREN'T GOING TO ANY OF YOUR CONFOUNDED SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WE'RE GOING ON A REG'LAR PICNIC AND IF I DON'T GIVE THOSE GIRLS THE TIME OF THEIR LIVES MY NAME AIN'T JOHN MERRICK
4481-17499-0042 A CHAPERONE INDEED MISSUS MERRICK HELD UP HER HANDS IN HORROR I'M NOT SURE JOHN SHE GASPED THAT I OUGHT TO TRUST MY DEAR CHILD WITH AN UNCLE WHO DISREGARDS SO OPENLY THE PROPRIETIES
4481-17499-0044 WHY YOU DON'T DARE SAY YOUR SOUL'S YOUR OWN WHEN LOUISE IS AWAKE THAT CHAPERONE BUSINESS IS ALL HUMBUGGERY UNLESS AN OLD UNCLE LIKE ME CAN BE A CHAPERONE ANYHOW I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE APPOINTED I WON'T WAIT FOR LOUISE TO WAKE UP
4481-17499-0045 JUST TELL HER THE NEWS AND HELP HER TO GET READY ON TIME AND NOW I'M OFF GOOD MORNING MARTHA SHE REALLY HAD NO WORDS OF PROTEST READY AT HAND AND IT WAS LONG AFTER QUEER OLD JOHN MERRICK HAD GONE AWAY THAT SHE REMEMBERED A DOZEN EFFECTIVE SPEECHES THAT SHE MIGHT HAVE DELIVERED
4481-17499-0047 AND IT IS JUST AS WELL TO POSTPONE ANY ENGAGEMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT THE FACTS I CAN DO THAT NICELY WHILE MY SWEET CHILD IS IN EUROPE WITH UNCLE JOHN AND AWAY FROM ALL DANGER OF ENTANGLEMENTS
4640-19187-0000 AND JUNE EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT KNEW A GREAT DEAL MORE ABOUT IT THAN JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO SO THE BARRICADE OF THE
4640-19187-0002 ALL SORTS OF RUBBISH BROUGHT AND ADDED FROM ALL DIRECTIONS COMPLICATED THE EXTERNAL CONFUSION THE REDOUBT HAD BEEN CLEVERLY MADE OVER INTO A WALL ON THE INSIDE AND A THICKET ON THE OUTSIDE
4640-19187-0003 THE STAIRCASE OF PAVING STONES WHICH PERMITTED ONE TO MOUNT IT LIKE THE WALL OF A CITADEL HAD BEEN RECONSTRUCTED THE BARRICADE HAD BEEN PUT IN ORDER THE TAP ROOM DISENCUMBERED
4640-19187-0005 WHICH ALLOWED THE INSURGENTS TO BREATHE MORE FREELY THEY HAD FOUND MEANS OF TAKING REFUGE IN SOME NEIGHBORING HOUSE THE GREATER PART OF THE WOUNDED WERE ABLE AND WISHED TO FIGHT STILL
4640-19187-0006 ON A LITTER OF MATTRESSES AND TRUSSES OF STRAW IN THE KITCHEN WHICH HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO AN AMBULANCE THERE WERE FIVE MEN GRAVELY WOUNDED TWO OF WHOM WERE MUNICIPAL GUARDSMEN
4640-19187-0008 AND MABEUF LYING PRONE THE POLE OF THE OMNIBUS ALTHOUGH SNAPPED OFF BY THE FUSILLADE WAS STILL SUFFICIENTLY UPRIGHT TO ADMIT OF THEIR FASTENING THE FLAG TO IT
4640-19187-0009 THE FIFTY MEN IN THE BARRICADE HAD SPEEDILY EXHAUSTED THE SCANTY PROVISIONS OF THE WINE SHOP DURING THE SIXTEEN HOURS WHICH THEY HAD PASSED THERE
4640-19187-0011 WITH WHY
4640-19187-0012 AS THEY COULD NO LONGER EAT
4640-19187-0014 AND IN ORDER THAT NO ONE MIGHT TOUCH THEM HE HAD THEM PLACED UNDER THE TABLE ON WHICH FATHER MABEUF WAS LYING ABOUT TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THEY RECKONED UP THEIR STRENGTH THERE WERE STILL THIRTY SEVEN OF THEM
4640-19187-0015 THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN THE TORCH WHICH HAD BEEN REPLACED IN ITS CAVITY IN THE PAVEMENT HAD JUST BEEN EXTINGUISHED THE INTERIOR OF THE BARRICADE THAT SPECIES OF TINY COURTYARD APPROPRIATED FROM THE STREET
4640-19187-0017 DAWN AWAKENS MINDS AS IT DOES THE BIRDS ALL BEGAN TO TALK JOLY PERCEIVING A CAT PROWLING ON A GUTTER EXTRACTED PHILOSOPHY FROM IT WHAT IS THE CAT HE EXCLAIMED
4640-19187-0018 IT IS A CORRECTIVE THE GOOD GOD HAVING MADE THE MOUSE SAID HULLO I HAVE COMMITTED A BLUNDER AND SO HE MADE THE CAT THE CAT IS THE ERRATUM OF THE MOUSE
4640-19187-0020 OUR HEARTS QUIVER SO AND HUMAN LIFE IS SUCH A MYSTERY THAT EVEN IN THE CASE OF A CIVIC MURDER EVEN IN A MURDER FOR LIBERATION IF THERE BE SUCH A THING
4640-19187-0021 THE REMORSE FOR HAVING STRUCK A MAN SURPASSES THE JOY OF HAVING SERVED THE HUMAN RACE AND SUCH ARE THE WINDINGS OF THE EXCHANGE OF SPEECH THAT A MOMENT LATER BY A TRANSITION BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH JEAN PROUVAIRE'S VERSES
4640-19187-0023 COURNAND WITH DELILLE POINTING OUT THE PASSAGES TRANSLATED BY MALFILATRE PARTICULARLY THE PRODIGIES OF CAESAR'S DEATH AND AT THAT WORD CAESAR THE CONVERSATION REVERTED TO BRUTUS
4640-19187-0024 CAESAR SAID COMBEFERRE FELL JUSTLY CICERO WAS SEVERE TOWARDS CAESAR AND HE WAS RIGHT THAT SEVERITY IS NOT DIATRIBE
4640-19187-0026 THE BLADE BUT ANTIQUITY ADMITTED IT CAESAR THE VIOLATOR OF THE RUBICON CONFERRING AS THOUGH THEY CAME FROM HIM THE DIGNITIES WHICH EMANATED FROM THE PEOPLE NOT RISING AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SENATE
4640-19187-0027 COMMITTED THE ACTS OF A KING AND ALMOST OF A TYRANT
4640-19187-0029 HE HAD MADE HIS WAY OUT THROUGH MONDETOUR LANE GLIDING ALONG CLOSE TO THE HOUSES THE INSURGENTS WE WILL REMARK WERE FULL OF HOPE
4640-19187-0030 THAN AS TO THEIR CAUSE MOREOVER SUCCOR WAS EVIDENTLY ON THE WAY TO THEM THEY RECKONED ON IT WITH THAT FACILITY OF TRIUMPHANT PROPHECY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SOURCES OF STRENGTH IN THE FRENCH COMBATANT

4640-19187-0039 IT WAS HAILED WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC ACCLAMATION NO ONE EVER HAS KNOWN THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO SPOKE THUS HE WAS SOME UNKNOWN BLOUSE WEARER A STRANGER
4640-19187-0041 LET US GET OURSELVES KILLED HERE TO THE VERY LAST MAN

4640-19188-0020 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT BECOMES OF HIM WHEN HE IS ABANDONED I HAVE SEEN ONE A VERY SMALL CREATURE NO TALLER THAN THAT HIS FATHER WAS DEAD POOR PEOPLE HAD TAKEN HIM IN OUT OF CHARITY
4640-19188-0021 AND WHOSE PIPE YOU KNOW WAS OF MASTIC AND YELLOW CLAY HIS BREATHING WAS HOARSE HIS FACE LIVID HIS LIMBS FLACCID HIS BELLY PROMINENT HE SAID NOTHING IF YOU SPOKE TO HIM HE DID NOT ANSWER
4640-19188-0023 THAT POOR BRAT I REMEMBER AND I SEEM TO SEE HIM NOW WHEN HE LAY NUDE ON THE DISSECTING TABLE HOW HIS RIBS STOOD OUT ON HIS SKIN LIKE THE GRAVES BENEATH THE GRASS IN A CEMETERY
4640-19188-0024 STATISTICS SHOW THAT THE MORTALITY AMONG ABANDONED CHILDREN IS FIFTY FIVE PER CENT I REPEAT IT IS A QUESTION OF WOMEN IT CONCERNS MOTHERS IT CONCERNS YOUNG GIRLS IT CONCERNS LITTLE CHILDREN
4640-19188-0026 STRANGE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE HUMAN HEART AT ITS MOST SUBLIME MOMENTS COMBEFERRE WHO SPOKE THUS WAS NOT AN ORPHAN HE RECALLED THE MOTHERS OF OTHER MEN AND FORGOT HIS OWN
4640-19188-0027 HE WAS ABOUT TO GET HIMSELF KILLED HE WAS AN EGOIST MARIUS FASTING FEVERED HAVING EMERGED IN SUCCESSION FROM ALL HOPE AND HAVING BEEN STRANDED IN GRIEF THE MOST SOMBRE OF SHIPWRECKS
4640-19188-0029 HE BEHELD MEN GOING AND COMING AS THROUGH A FLAME HE HEARD VOICES SPEAKING AS AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS BUT THIS MOVED HIM THERE WAS IN THIS SCENE A POINT WHICH PIERCED AND ROUSED EVEN HIM
4640-19188-0030 HE HAD BUT ONE IDEA NOW TO DIE AND HE DID NOT WISH TO BE TURNED ASIDE FROM IT BUT HE REFLECTED IN HIS GLOOMY SOMNAMBULISM THAT WHILE DESTROYING HIMSELF
4640-19188-0032 THIS IS THE REPUBLIC AND UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE REIGNS DO YOU YOURSELVES DESIGNATE THOSE WHO ARE TO GO THEY OBEYED AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF A FEW MINUTES FIVE WERE UNANIMOUSLY SELECTED
4640-19188-0033 AND STEPPED OUT OF THE RANKS THERE ARE FIVE OF THEM EXCLAIMED MARIUS THERE WERE ONLY FOUR UNIFORMS WELL BEGAN THE FIVE ONE MUST STAY BEHIND
4640-19188-0035 DO YOU DESIGNATE WHO IS TO REMAIN YES SAID THE FIVE CHOOSE WE WILL OBEY YOU MARIUS DID NOT BELIEVE THAT HE WAS CAPABLE OF ANOTHER EMOTION
4640-19188-0036 WHICH ONE BEHOLDS IN THE DEPTHS OF HISTORY HOVERING OVER THERMOPYLAE
4640-19188-0038 THE FIFTH MAN WAS SAVED
4640-19188-0039 THANKS TO HIS DRESS OF A NATIONAL GUARDSMAN HE HAD MADE HIS WAY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE SENTINEL STATIONED BY THE INSURGENTS IN THE RUE MONDETOUR HAD NO OCCASION TO GIVE THE ALARM FOR A SINGLE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
4640-19189-0000 THE PLENITUDE OF THE REVOLUTION HE WAS INCOMPLETE HOWEVER SO FAR AS THE ABSOLUTE CAN BE SO HE HAD TOO MUCH OF SAINT JUST ABOUT HIM AND NOT ENOUGH OF ANACHARSIS CLOOTS
4640-19189-0001 STILL HIS MIND IN THE SOCIETY OF THE FRIENDS OF THE A B C HAD ENDED BY UNDERGOING A CERTAIN POLARIZATION FROM COMBEFERRE'S IDEAS FOR SOME TIME PAST HE HAD BEEN GRADUALLY EMERGING FROM THE NARROW FORM OF DOGMA
4640-19189-0003 A SORT OF STIFLED FIRE DARTED FROM HIS EYES WHICH WERE FILLED WITH AN INWARD LOOK ALL AT ONCE HE THREW BACK HIS HEAD HIS BLOND LOCKS FELL BACK LIKE THOSE OF AN ANGEL ON THE SOMBRE QUADRIGA MADE OF STARS
4640-19189-0004 THEY WERE LIKE THE MANE OF A STARTLED LION IN THE FLAMING OF AN HALO
4640-19189-0006 HUMAN CONSCIENCE BECOME AN ALTAR NO MORE HATREDS THE FRATERNITY OF THE WORKSHOP AND THE SCHOOL FOR SOLE PENALTY AND RECOMPENSE FAME WORK FOR ALL RIGHT FOR ALL
4640-19189-0007 PEACE OVER ALL NO MORE BLOODSHED NO MORE WARS HAPPY MOTHERS TO CONQUER MATTER IS THE FIRST STEP TO REALIZE THE IDEAL IS THE SECOND REFLECT ON WHAT PROGRESS HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED
4640-19189-0009 ON THE DAY WHEN THIS PROMETHEAN TASK SHALL BE ACCOMPLISHED AND WHEN MAN SHALL HAVE DEFINITELY HARNESSED TO HIS WILL THE TRIPLE CHIMAERA OF ANTIQUITY THE HYDRA THE DRAGON AND THE GRIFFIN
4640-19189-0010 COURAGE AND ONWARD CITIZENS WHITHER ARE WE GOING TO SCIENCE MADE GOVERNMENT TO THE FORCE OF THINGS BECOME THE SOLE PUBLIC FORCE
4640-19189-0012 EUROPE WILL HAVE HER AMPHICTYONS THE GLOBE WILL HAVE ITS AMPHICTYONS FRANCE BEARS THIS SUBLIME FUTURE IN HER BREAST THIS IS THE GESTATION OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
4640-19189-0013 I REVERE YOU YES YOU CLEARLY BEHOLD THE FUTURE YES YOU ARE RIGHT YOU HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER
4640-19189-0015 WHERE TWO OR THREE OF THESE SOVEREIGNTIES ARE COMBINED THE STATE BEGINS BUT IN THAT ASSOCIATION THERE IS NO ABDICATION EACH SOVEREIGNTY CONCEDES A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF ITSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORMING THE COMMON RIGHT
4640-19189-0016 THIS QUANTITY IS THE SAME FOR ALL OF US THIS IDENTITY OF CONCESSION WHICH EACH MAKES TO ALL IS CALLED EQUALITY COMMON RIGHT IS NOTHING ELSE THAN THE PROTECTION OF ALL BEAMING ON THE RIGHT OF EACH
4640-19189-0018 HENCE WHAT IS CALLED THE SOCIAL BOND SOME SAY SOCIAL CONTRACT WHICH IS THE SAME THING THE WORD CONTRACT
4640-19189-0019 A SOCIETY OF GREAT BLADES OF GRASS AND TINY OAKS A PROXIMITY OF JEALOUSIES WHICH RENDER EACH OTHER NULL AND VOID LEGALLY SPEAKING IT IS ALL APTITUDES POSSESSED OF THE SAME OPPORTUNITY
4640-19189-0021 AN IDENTICAL SOCIETY WILL SPRING YES INSTRUCTION LIGHT LIGHT EVERYTHING COMES FROM LIGHT AND TO IT EVERYTHING RETURNS CITIZENS THE NINETEENTH CENTURY IS GREAT BUT THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WILL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0022 THEN THERE WILL BE NOTHING MORE LIKE THE HISTORY OF OLD WE SHALL NO LONGER AS TO DAY HAVE TO FEAR A CONQUEST AN INVASION A USURPATION A RIVALRY OF NATIONS
4640-19189-0024 FROM THE FAILURE OF WORK AND THE SCAFFOLD AND THE SWORD AND BATTLES AND THE RUFFIANISM OF CHANCE IN THE FOREST OF EVENTS ONE MIGHT ALMOST SAY THERE WILL BE NO MORE EVENTS WE SHALL BE HAPPY
4640-19189-0025 AS THE PLANET AROUND THE LIGHT FRIENDS THE PRESENT HOUR IN WHICH I AM ADDRESSING YOU IS A GLOOMY HOUR BUT THESE ARE TERRIBLE PURCHASES OF THE FUTURE A REVOLUTION IS A TOLL
4640-19189-0027 A HEAP OF IDEAS AND A HEAP OF WOES HERE MISERY MEETS THE IDEAL THE DAY EMBRACES THE NIGHT AND SAYS TO IT I AM ABOUT TO DIE AND THOU SHALT BE BORN AGAIN WITH ME
4640-19189-0028 FROM THE EMBRACE OF ALL DESOLATIONS FAITH LEAPS FORTH SUFFERINGS BRING HITHER THEIR AGONY AND IDEAS THEIR IMMORTALITY THIS AGONY AND THIS IMMORTALITY ARE ABOUT TO JOIN
4640-19189-0030 HIS LIPS CONTINUED TO MOVE SILENTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE TALKING TO HIMSELF WHICH CAUSED THEM ALL TO GAZE ATTENTIVELY AT HIM IN THE ENDEAVOR TO HEAR MORE THERE WAS NO APPLAUSE
4640-19189-0031 JAVERT LACONIC
4640-19189-0033 MARIUS LET US INSIST ON THIS POINT WAS UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DARK WINGS WHICH ARE SPREAD OVER THOSE IN THE DEATH AGONY HE FELT THAT HE HAD ENTERED THE TOMB
4640-19189-0034 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND HE NO LONGER BEHELD THE FACES OF THE LIVING EXCEPT WITH THE EYES OF ONE DEAD
4640-19189-0036 AND HAD NOT EVEN THE AIR OF HEARING HIM WHEN MARIUS RAISED HIS VOICE TO SAY I KNOW HIM
4640-19189-0037 AND IF SUCH A WORD CAN BE USED FOR SUCH IMPRESSIONS WE SHOULD SAY THAT IT PLEASED HIM HE HAD ALWAYS FELT THE ABSOLUTE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ADDRESSING THAT ENIGMATICAL MAN WHO WAS IN HIS EYES
4640-19189-0039 THE FIVE CHOSEN MEN LEFT THE BARRICADE BY WAY OF MONDETOUR LANE
4640-19189-0040 ONE OF THEM WEPT AS HE TOOK HIS LEAVE BEFORE SETTING OUT THEY EMBRACED THOSE WHO REMAINED WHEN THE FIVE MEN SENT BACK TO LIFE HAD TAKEN THEIR DEPARTURE
4640-19189-0042 JAVERT REPLIED WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME WAIT WE NEED ALL OUR CARTRIDGES JUST AT PRESENT THEN GIVE ME A DRINK SAID JAVERT
4640-19189-0043 THEY ADDED TO THE SYSTEM OF LIGATURES WHICH RENDERED EVERY ATTEMPT AT ESCAPE IMPOSSIBLE THAT SORT OF BOND WHICH IS CALLED IN PRISONS A MARTINGALE WHICH STARTING AT THE NECK
4680-16026-0000 THE FOLLOWING DAY WAS THE THREE D OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO A DATE WHICH IT IS NECESSARY TO INDICATE ON ACCOUNT OF THE GRAVE EVENTS WHICH AT THAT EPOCH HUNG ON THE HORIZON OF PARIS IN THE STATE OF LIGHTNING CHARGED CLOUDS

4680-16026-0003 AND READILY RECOGNIZED THE ONE WHICH MARIUS HAD MOVED
4680-16026-0004 NONE OF THAT LISETTE SHE SEATED HERSELF ON THE UNDERPINNING OF THE RAILING CLOSE BESIDE THE BAR AS THOUGH SHE WERE GUARDING IT IT WAS PRECISELY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RAILING TOUCHED THE NEIGHBORING WALL THERE WAS A DIM NOOK THERE
4680-16026-0006 AN OLD BELATED BOURGEOIS WHO WAS MAKING HASTE TO ESCAPE FROM THIS
4680-16026-0007 AS HE SKIRTED THE GARDEN RAILINGS AND REACHED THE ANGLE WHICH IT MADE WITH THE WALL HEARD A DULL AND THREATENING VOICE SAYING I'M NO LONGER SURPRISED THAT HE COMES HERE EVERY EVENING
4680-16026-0009 THE FIRST TO ARRIVE AT THE GARDEN RAILING HALTED AND WAITED FOR THE OTHERS
4680-16026-0010 GRASPING EACH BAR IN SUCCESSION AND SHAKING THEM CAUTIOUSLY THUS HE CAME TO THE BAR WHICH MARIUS HAD LOOSENED AS HE WAS ON THE POINT OF GRASPING THIS BAR A HAND EMERGED ABRUPTLY FROM THE DARKNESS FELL UPON HIS ARM
4680-16026-0012 THE MAN UNDERWENT THAT SHOCK WHICH THE UNEXPECTED ALWAYS BRINGS HE BRISTLED UP IN HIDEOUS WISE NOTHING IS SO FORMIDABLE TO BEHOLD AS FEROCIOUS BEASTS WHO ARE UNEASY THEIR TERRIFIED AIR EVOKES TERROR
4680-16026-0013 BRUJON AND MONTPARNASSE HAD NOISELESSLY DRAWN NEAR WITHOUT PRECIPITATION WITHOUT UTTERING A WORD WITH THE SINISTER SLOWNESS PECULIAR TO THESE MEN OF THE NIGHT SOME INDESCRIBABLE BUT HIDEOUS TOOLS WERE VISIBLE IN THEIR HANDS

4680-16026-0033 AND SAID GENTLY WELL NO I WON'T APPROACH BUT DON'T SPEAK SO LOUD SO YOU INTEND TO HINDER US IN OUR WORK MY DAUGHTER BUT WE MUST EARN OUR LIVING ALL THE SAME
4680-16026-0034 AND HER ATTITUDE NOTHING MORE RESOLUTE AND MORE SURPRISING COULD BE SEEN THE SIX RASCALS SPEECHLESS AND GLOOMY AT BEING HELD IN CHECK BY A GIRL RETREATED BENEATH THE SHADOW CAST BY THE LANTERN AND HELD COUNSEL WITH FURIOUS AND

4680-16041-0001 MAD WITH GRIEF NO LONGER CONSCIOUS OF ANYTHING FIXED OR SOLID IN HIS BRAIN INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING ANYTHING THENCEFORTH OF FATE AFTER THOSE TWO MONTHS PASSED IN THE INTOXICATION OF YOUTH AND LOVE
4680-16041-0002 OVERWHELMED AT ONCE BY ALL THE REVERIES OF DESPAIR HE HAD BUT ONE DESIRE REMAINING TO MAKE A SPEEDY END OF ALL HE SET OUT AT RAPID PACE HE FOUND HIMSELF MOST OPPORTUNELY ARMED
4680-16041-0004 AND REACHED THE RUE DE RIVOLI THE SHOPS WERE OPEN THERE
4680-16041-0005 WOMEN WERE MAKING THEIR PURCHASES IN THE STALLS PEOPLE WERE EATING ICES IN THE CAFE LAITER AND NIBBLING SMALL CAKES AT THE ENGLISH PASTRY COOK'S SHOP
4680-16041-0007 NEAR THE FOUNTAIN OF THE ARBRE SEC THERE WERE ASSEMBLAGES MOTIONLESS AND GLOOMY GROUPS WHICH WERE TO THOSE WHO WENT AND CAME AS STONES IN THE MIDST OF RUNNING WATER AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE DES PROUVAIRES
4680-16041-0008 THERE WERE HARDLY ANY BLACK COATS OR ROUND HATS NOW BUT SMOCK FROCKS BLOUSES CAPS AND BRISTLING AND CADAVEROUS HEADS THIS MULTITUDE UNDULATED CONFUSEDLY IN THE NOCTURNAL GLOOM
4680-16041-0010 ONLY THE SOLITARY AND DIMINISHING ROWS OF LANTERNS COULD BE SEEN VANISHING INTO THE STREET IN THE DISTANCE THE LANTERNS OF THAT DATE RESEMBLED LARGE RED STARS HANGING TO ROPES AND SHED UPON THE PAVEMENT A SHADOW
4680-16041-0011 WHICH HAD THE FORM OF A HUGE SPIDER THESE STREETS WERE NOT DESERTED THERE COULD BE DESCRIED PILES OF GUNS MOVING BAYONETS AND TROOPS BIVOUACKING NO CURIOUS OBSERVER PASSED THAT LIMIT THERE CIRCULATION CEASED
4680-16041-0013 HE SHUNNED THE PATROLS HE AVOIDED THE SENTINELS HE MADE A CIRCUIT REACHED THE RUE DE BETHISY
4680-16041-0014 THERE WERE NO LONGER ANY LANTERNS AFTER HAVING PASSED THE ZONE OF THE CROWD HE HAD PASSED THE LIMITS OF THE TROOPS HE FOUND HIMSELF IN SOMETHING STARTLING THERE WAS NO LONGER A PASSER BY NO LONGER A SOLDIER
4680-16041-0016 ENTERING A STREET WAS LIKE ENTERING A CELLAR HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE HE TOOK A FEW STEPS SOME ONE PASSED CLOSE TO HIM AT A RUN WAS IT A MAN OR A WOMAN WERE THERE MANY OF THEM HE COULD NOT HAVE TOLD
4680-16041-0017 IT HAD PASSED AND VANISHED PROCEEDING FROM CIRCUIT TO CIRCUIT HE REACHED A LANE WHICH HE JUDGED TO BE THE RUE DE LA POTERIE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THIS STREET
4680-16041-0019 HE CLIMBED OVER THE STONES AND FOUND HIMSELF ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BARRIER HE WALKED VERY NEAR THE STREET POSTS AND GUIDED HIMSELF ALONG THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES A LITTLE BEYOND THE BARRICADE IT SEEMED TO HIM
4680-16041-0020 MARIUS LEFT THE HORSES BEHIND HIM AS HE WAS APPROACHING A STREET WHICH SEEMED TO HIM TO BE THE RUE DU CONTRAT SOCIAL A SHOT COMING NO ONE KNOWS WHENCE AND TRAVERSING THE DARKNESS AT RANDOM WHISTLED CLOSE BY HIM
4680-16041-0022 WHICH IS LIKE A CITY WITHIN A CITY
4680-16041-0023 HOLLOWED OUT IN THE CENTRE OF PARIS THERE THE GLANCE FELL INTO AN ABYSS THANKS TO THE BROKEN LANTERNS THANKS TO THE CLOSED WINDOWS THERE ALL RADIANCE ALL LIFE ALL SOUND ALL MOVEMENT CEASED
4680-16041-0025 TO MULTIPLY EVERY COMBATANT BY THE POSSIBILITIES WHICH THAT OBSCURITY CONTAINS AT DUSK EVERY WINDOW WHERE A CANDLE WAS BURNING RECEIVED A SHOT THE LIGHT WAS EXTINGUISHED SOMETIMES THE INHABITANT WAS KILLED HENCE
4680-16041-0026 NOTHING WAS STIRRING THERE WAS NOTHING BUT FRIGHT MOURNING STUPOR IN THE HOUSES AND IN THE STREETS A SORT OF SACRED HORROR NOT EVEN THE LONG ROWS OF WINDOWS AND STORES THE INDENTATIONS OF THE CHIMNEYS AND THE ROOFS
4680-16041-0028 OF INDISTINCT GLEAMS WHICH BROUGHT OUT BROKEN AND ECCENTRIC LINES AND PROFILES OF SINGULAR BUILDINGS SOMETHING LIKE THE LIGHTS WHICH GO AND COME IN RUINS IT WAS AT SUCH POINTS THAT THE BARRICADES WERE SITUATED
4680-16041-0029 THE REST WAS A LAKE OF OBSCURITY FOGGY HEAVY AND FUNEREAL ABOVE WHICH IN MOTIONLESS AND MELANCHOLY OUTLINES ROSE THE TOWER OF SAINT JACQUES
4680-16041-0031 AND AS WE HAVE JUST SEEN ANY STREET WHICH ONE MIGHT COME TO OFFERED NOTHING BUT DARKNESS A WILD DARKNESS FULL OF TRAPS FULL OF UNSEEN AND FORMIDABLE SHOCKS INTO WHICH IT WAS ALARMING TO PENETRATE
4680-16041-0032 ALL WAS OVER NO MORE LIGHT WAS TO BE HOPED FOR HENCEFORTH EXCEPT THE LIGHTNING OF GUNS NO FURTHER ENCOUNTER EXCEPT THE ABRUPT AND RAPID APPARITION OF DEATH WHERE HOW WHEN NO ONE KNEW
4680-16041-0034 THAT THE MOST TIMID FELT THEMSELVES SEIZED WITH RESOLUTION AND THE MOST DARING WITH TERROR MOREOVER ON BOTH SIDES THE FURY THE RAGE AND THE DETERMINATION WERE EQUAL
4680-16041-0035 FOR THE ONE PARTY TO ADVANCE MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF RETREATING FOR THE OTHER TO REMAIN MEANT DEATH AND NO ONE DREAMED OF FLIGHT IT WAS INDISPENSABLE THAT ALL SHOULD BE ENDED ON THE FOLLOWING DAY
4680-16041-0037 HERE ONLY ONE SOUND WAS AUDIBLE A SOUND AS HEART RENDING AS THE DEATH RATTLE
4680-16041-0038 NATURE SEEMED TO HAVE FALLEN INTO ACCORD WITH WHAT MEN WERE ABOUT TO DO NOTHING DISTURBED THE HARMONY OF THE WHOLE EFFECT THE STARS HAD DISAPPEARED HEAVY CLOUDS FILLED THE HORIZON WITH THEIR MELANCHOLY FOLDS
4680-16041-0040 CLASPING AND THROWING EACH OTHER WHILE EACH ONE HASTENED AND INVITED THE LAST AND DECISIVE HOUR OF THE CRISIS FAR AWAY AND QUITE OUTSIDE OF THIS FATAL QUARTER IN THE MOST PROFOUND DEPTHS OF THE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES OF THAT
4680-16041-0041 WRETCHED OLD PARIS WHICH DISAPPEARS UNDER THE SPLENDOR OF HAPPY AND OPULENT PARIS THE SOMBRE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE COULD BE HEARD GIVING UTTERANCE TO A DULL ROAR A FEARFUL AND SACRED VOICE
4680-16042-0001 HAD PRESERVED WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD AT THE CORNER OF THE LAST HOUSE ON HIS LEFT HE THRUST HIS HEAD FORWARD AND LOOKED INTO THE FRAGMENT OF THE RUE MONDETOUR
4680-16042-0002 WHICH CAST A BROAD CURTAIN OF SHADOW IN WHICH HE WAS HIMSELF ENGULFED HE PERCEIVED SOME LIGHT ON THE PAVEMENT A BIT OF THE WINE SHOP AND BEYOND A FLICKERING LAMP WITHIN A SORT OF SHAPELESS WALL AND MEN CROUCHING DOWN WITH GUNS ON THEIR KNEES
4680-16042-0004 MARIUS HAD BUT A STEP MORE TO TAKE
4680-16042-0005 FOLDED HIS ARMS AND FELL TO THINKING ABOUT HIS FATHER HE THOUGHT OF THAT HEROIC COLONEL PONTMERCY WHO HAD BEEN SO PROUD A SOLDIER WHO HAD GUARDED THE FRONTIER OF FRANCE UNDER THE REPUBLIC
4680-16042-0007 AT THE EXPIRATION OF TWENTY YEARS HAD RETURNED FROM THE GREAT WARS WITH A SCARRED CHEEK A SMILING COUNTENANCE TRANQUIL ADMIRABLE PURE AS A CHILD HAVING DONE EVERYTHING FOR FRANCE AND NOTHING AGAINST HER
4680-16042-0008 TO OFFER HIS BREAST TO BAYONETS TO SHED HIS BLOOD TO SEEK THE ENEMY TO SEEK DEATH THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO WAGE WAR IN HIS TURN AND DESCEND TO THE FIELD OF BATTLE AND THAT THE FIELD OF BATTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS TO DESCEND WAS THE STREET
4680-16042-0010 AND TO DEPART IN WRATH INTO THE GLOOM THAT IF IT HAD THUS FLED IT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS INTELLIGENT AND BECAUSE IT HAD FORESEEN THE FUTURE THAT IT HAD HAD A PRESENTIMENT OF THIS REBELLION THE WAR OF THE GUTTERS
4680-16042-0011 BLOWS GIVEN AND RECEIVED IN THE REAR IT WAS BECAUSE COMING FROM MARENGO AND FRIEDLAND IT DID NOT WISH TO GO TO THE RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE IT WAS BECAUSE AFTER WHAT IT HAD DONE WITH THE FATHER IT DID NOT WISH TO DO THIS FOR THE SON
4680-16042-0013 IT WOULD ASSUREDLY HAVE SCORCHED HIS HANDS AND BURST OUT AFLAME BEFORE HIS EYES LIKE THE SWORD OF THE ANGEL
4680-16042-0014 WOUND THE SIDE OF HIS COUNTRY AND THEN HE FELL TO WEEPING BITTERLY THIS WAS HORRIBLE BUT WHAT WAS HE TO DO LIVE WITHOUT COSETTE HE COULD NOT SINCE SHE WAS GONE HE MUST NEEDS DIE
4680-16042-0016 SHOULD HE RETREAT AFTER GOING SO FAR SHOULD HE FLEE FROM DANGER AFTER HAVING APPROACHED IT SHOULD HE SLIP AWAY AFTER HAVING COME AND PEEPED INTO THE BARRICADE SLIP AWAY ALL IN A TREMBLE SAYING AFTER ALL I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF IT AS IT IS
4680-16042-0017 WHO WERE A MERE HANDFUL AGAINST AN ARMY SHOULD HE BE UNTRUE AT ONCE TO HIS LOVE TO COUNTRY TO HIS WORD SHOULD HE GIVE TO HIS COWARDICE THE PRETEXT OF PATRIOTISM BUT THIS WAS IMPOSSIBLE AND IF THE PHANTOM OF HIS FATHER WAS THERE IN THE GLOOM
4680-16042-0019 IT MAKES ONE SEE CLEARLY TO BE NEAR DEATH THE VISION OF THE ACTION INTO WHICH HE FELT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS ON THE POINT OF ENTERING APPEARED TO HIM NO MORE AS LAMENTABLE BUT AS SUPERB
4680-16042-0020 HE LEFT NONE OF THEM UNANSWERED LET US SEE WHY SHOULD HIS FATHER BE INDIGNANT ARE THERE NOT CASES WHERE INSURRECTION RISES TO THE DIGNITY OF DUTY
4680-16042-0022 THERE IS ONLY JUST AND UNJUST WAR UNTIL THAT DAY WHEN THE GRAND HUMAN AGREEMENT IS CONCLUDED WAR THAT AT LEAST WHICH IS THE EFFORT OF THE FUTURE WHICH IS HASTENING ON AGAINST THE PAST WHICH IS LAGGING IN THE REAR MAY BE NECESSARY
4680-16042-0023 WHETHER FOREIGN OR CIVIL IS INIQUITOUS IT IS CALLED CRIME OUTSIDE THE PALE OF THAT HOLY THING JUSTICE BY WHAT RIGHT DOES ONE FORM OF MAN DESPISE ANOTHER BY WHAT RIGHT SHOULD THE SWORD OF WASHINGTON
4680-16042-0025 WAR OF THE STREETS WHY NOT THAT WAS THE WAR OF AMBIORIX OF ARTEVELDE OF MARNIX OF PELAGIUS BUT AMBIORIX FOUGHT AGAINST ROME ARTEVELDE AGAINST FRANCE
4680-16042-0026 AN INVASION VIOLATES THE GEOGRAPHICAL FRONTIER DRIVING OUT THE TYRANT OR DRIVING OUT THE ENGLISH IN BOTH CASES REGAINING POSSESSION OF ONE'S OWN TERRITORY THERE COMES AN HOUR WHEN PROTESTATION NO LONGER SUFFICES
4680-16042-0028 AFTER DIDEROT DANTON MULTITUDES HAVE A TENDENCY TO ACCEPT THE MASTER THEIR MASS BEARS WITNESS TO APATHY A CROWD IS EASILY LED AS A WHOLE TO OBEDIENCE MEN MUST BE STIRRED UP PUSHED ON
4680-16042-0029 TREATED ROUGHLY BY THE VERY BENEFIT OF THEIR DELIVERANCE THEIR EYES MUST BE WOUNDED BY THE TRUE LIGHT MUST BE HURLED AT THEM IN TERRIBLE HANDFULS
4680-16042-0031 ARE WHAT HISTORY IS IN THE HABIT OF CALLING GOOD KINGS BUT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT TO BE PARCELLED OUT THE LOGIC OF THE TRUE IS RECTILINEAR THE PECULIARITY OF TRUTH IS THAT IT LACKS COMPLAISANCE NO CONCESSIONS THEN
4680-16042-0032 BOTH REPRESENT IN A CERTAIN MEASURE THE CONFISCATION OF RIGHT AND IN ORDER TO CLEAR AWAY UNIVERSAL INSURRECTION THEY MUST BE COMBATED IT MUST BE DONE FRANCE BEING ALWAYS THE ONE TO BEGIN
4680-16042-0034 RESTORES THE PEOPLE TO THE PEOPLE RESTORES SOVEREIGNTY TO MAN REPLACES THE PURPLE ON THE HEAD OF FRANCE RESTORES EQUITY AND REASON IN THEIR PLENITUDE SUPPRESSES EVERY GERM OF ANTAGONISM BY RESTORING EACH ONE TO HIMSELF
4680-16042-0035 ANNIHILATES THE OBSTACLE WHICH ROYALTY PRESENTS TO THE WHOLE IMMENSE UNIVERSAL CONCORD AND PLACES THE HUMAN RACE ONCE MORE ON A LEVEL WITH THE RIGHT THESE WARS BUILD UP PEACE
4680-16042-0037 WITHOUT MOVING AND THERE WAS PERCEPTIBLE THAT QUASI SILENCE WHICH MARKS THE LAST STAGE OF EXPECTATION OVERHEAD AT THE SMALL WINDOW IN THE THIRD STORY MARIUS DESCRIED A SORT OF SPECTATOR WHO APPEARED TO HIM TO BE SINGULARLY ATTENTIVE
4680-16042-0038 THIS WAS THE PORTER WHO HAD BEEN KILLED BY LE CABUC BELOW BY THE LIGHTS OF THE TORCH WHICH WAS THRUST BETWEEN THE PAVING STONES THIS HEAD COULD BE VAGUELY DISTINGUISHED NOTHING COULD BE STRANGER IN THAT SOMBRE AND UNCERTAIN GLEAM
4788-91208-0000 IT LOOKS BIG AND IMPORTANT AND IT MAKES A GREAT NOISE EVEN PEOPLE A LONG WAY UP IN THE SCALE OF CIVILIZATION ARE IN THE HABIT OF TAKING THESE ATTRIBUTES PERHAPS NOT AS THE ESSENTIAL ONES OF LEADERSHIP BUT AT ALL EVENTS AS THOSE BY WHICH A LEADER MAY BE RECOGNIZED
4788-91208-0001 THE POINTSMAN MOVES A HANDLE AND THE FOAMING GIANT THAT WOULD IT MAY BE HAVE SPED ON TO HIS DESTRUCTION AND THAT OF THE PASSIVE CREW WHO FOLLOW IN HIS REAR IS SHUNTED TO ANOTHER LINE RUNNING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND TO A MORE DESIRABLE GOAL
4788-91208-0003 MISTER MILL'S ACHIEVEMENTS IN BOTH BRANCHES OF PHILOSOPHY ARE SUCH AS TO GIVE HIM THE FOREMOST PLACE IN EITHER WHETHER WE REGARD HIM AS AN EXPOUNDER OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF MIND OR THE PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIETY HE IS
4788-91208-0004 THE STRUCTURE RAISED BY ADAM SMITH MALTHUS AND RICARDO BUT RAISED IT AT LEAST ONE STORY HIGHER HIS INESTIMABLE SYSTEM OF LOGIC WAS A REVOLUTION IT HARDLY NEEDS OF COURSE TO BE SAID THAT HE OWED MUCH TO HIS PREDECESSORS
4788-91208-0006 OF THE MASS OF ORIGINAL THOUGHT THAT STILL REMAINS TO MISTER MILL'S CREDIT THE GREAT CRITICAL POWER THAT COULD GATHER VALUABLE TRUTHS FROM SO MANY DISCORDANT SOURCES AND THE WONDERFUL SYNTHETIC ABILITY REQUIRED TO WELD THESE AND HIS OWN CONTRIBUTIONS
4788-91208-0007 INTO ONE ORGANIC WHOLE WHEN MISTER MILL COMMENCED HIS LABORS THE ONLY LOGIC RECOGNIZED WAS THE SYLLOGISTIC
4788-91208-0009 SOME GENERAL PROPOSITIONS TO START WITH AND THESE GENERAL PROPOSITIONS BEING EX
4788-91208-0010 INCAPABLE OF BEING PROVED FROM OTHER PROPOSITIONS IT FOLLOWED THAT IF THEY WERE KNOWN TO US AT ALL THEY MUST BE ORIGINAL DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS HERE WAS A PERFECT PARADISE OF QUESTION BEGGING THE ULTIMATE MAJOR PREMISE IN EVERY ARGUMENT BEING ASSUMED
4788-91208-0012 AS THE ONLY BASES OF REASONING IT IS TRUE THAT OUTSIDE OF THE LOGIC OF THE SCHOOLS GREAT ADVANCES HAD BEEN MADE IN THE RULES OF SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THESE RULES WERE NOT ONLY IMPERFECT IN THEMSELVES BUT THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE LAW OF CAUSATION
4788-91208-0013 WAS BUT IMPERFECTLY REALIZED AND THEIR TRUE RELATION TO SYLLOGISM HARDLY DREAMT OF MISTER MILL ALTERED ALL THIS HE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GENERAL TYPE OF REASONING IS NEITHER FROM GENERALS TO PARTICULARS NOR FROM PARTICULARS TO GENERALS BUT FROM PARTICULARS TO PARTICULARS
4788-91208-0015 THE MORTALITY OF JOHN THOMAS AND OTHERS IS AFTER ALL THE WHOLE EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR THE MORTALITY OF THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON NOT ONE IOTA IS ADDED TO THE PROOF BY INTERPOLATING A GENERAL PROPOSITION
4788-91208-0016 WE NOT ONLY MAY ACCORDING TO MISTER MILL REASON FROM SOME PARTICULAR INSTANCES TO OTHERS BUT WE FREQUENTLY DO SO AS HOWEVER THE INSTANCES WHICH ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE ONE FRESH INSTANCE
4788-91208-0018 ALL REASONING IS SHOWN TO BE AT BOTTOM INDUCTIVE INDUCTIONS AND THEIR INTERPRETATION MAKE UP THE WHOLE OF LOGIC AND TO INDUCTION ACCORDINGLY MISTER MILL DEVOTED HIS CHIEF ATTENTION FOR THE FIRST TIME INDUCTION WAS TREATED AS THE OPUS MAGNUM OF LOGIC
4788-91208-0019 AND THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SCIENCE TRACED TO THEIR INDUCTIVE ORIGIN IT WAS THIS TAKEN WITH HIS THEORY OF THE SYLLOGISM WHICH WORKED THE GREAT CHANGE BOTH HIS SYSTEM OF LOGIC AND HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY
4788-91208-0021 THE PERFECTION OF HIS METHOD ITS APPLICATION AND THE UPROOTING OF PREJUDICES WHICH STOOD IN ITS WAY THIS WAS THE TASK TO WHICH MISTER MILL APPLIED HIMSELF WITH AN ABILITY AND SUCCESS RARELY MATCHED AND NEVER SURPASSED
4788-91208-0022 THE BIGGEST LION IN THE PATH WAS THE DOCTRINE OF SO CALLED NECESSARY TRUTH THIS DOCTRINE WAS ESPECIALLY OBNOXIOUS TO HIM AS IT SET UP A PURELY SUBJECTIVE STANDARD OF TRUTH AND A STANDARD AS HE WAS EASILY ABLE TO SHOW
4788-91208-0024 OF THE CONTRADICTORY OF A PROPOSITION IS A PROOF OF ITS TRUTH CO EQUAL WITH EXPERIENCE BUT THAT ITS VALUE TRANSCENDS EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE MAY TELL US WHAT IS BUT IT IS BY THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF CONCEIVING IT OTHERWISE
4788-91208-0025 IN HIS EXAMINATION OF SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON'S PHILOSOPHY MISTER MILL GIVES BATTLE TO THIS MODE OF THOUGHT AFTER REVIEWING IN AN OPENING CHAPTER THE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH HAVE BEEN HELD RESPECTING THE RELATIVITY OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
4788-91208-0027 BY A MISTAKE HE FELL INTO THE NECESSITY OF LOOKING AT THE MATTER IN THE CONCRETE HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE FORCE OF MISTER MILL'S ARGUMENT THAT THE INFINITE MUST INCLUDE A FARRAGO OF CONTRADICTIONS
4788-91208-0028 IN WHICH THESE CONTRADICTORY ATTRIBUTES INHERE BUT IT WAS AGAINST A CORRESPONDING BEING THE INFINITE THAT MISTER MILL WAS ARGUING IT IS THIS THAT HE CALLS A
4788-91208-0030 AND PRESCRIBE TO HIM A RULE OF LIFE THAT PERSON HAS A RELIGION AND THOUGH EVERY ONE NATURALLY PREFERS HIS OWN RELIGION TO ANY OTHER ALL MUST ADMIT THAT IF THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTACHMENT AND OF THIS FEELING OF DUTY IS THE AGGREGATE OF OUR FELLOW CREATURES
4788-91208-0031 THIS RELIGION OF THE INFIDEL CANNOT IN HONESTY AND CONSCIENCE BE CALLED AN INTRINSICALLY BAD ONE MANY INDEED MAY BE UNABLE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS OBJECT IS CAPABLE OF GATHERING ROUND IT FEELINGS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG
4788-91208-0033 NEVER HAS THE LIBEL OF HUMANITY INVOLVED IN THE CURRENT THEOLOGY BEEN MORE FORCIBLY POINTED OUT WITH ITS CONSTANT APPEAL TO LOW MOTIVES OF PERSONAL GAIN
4788-91208-0034 AND ALL HIS RELATIONS TO HIS FELLOW CREATURES THE VERY BIRDS ABOUT HIS DWELLING SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE IT IT IS THIS NOBLE SENTIMENT WHICH INFUSES A SOUL OF LIFE INTO HIS TEACHINGS AND THE ENUNCIATION AND ACTING OUT OF WHICH CONSTITUTE HIM
4788-94904-0001 THAT FORM OF GOVERNMENT WILL BE GENERALLY SPEAKING LESS SUITABLE TO THEM THOUGH THIS IS NOT TRUE UNIVERSALLY FOR THE ADAPTATION OF A PEOPLE TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT DEPEND SO MUCH UPON THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE GENERAL SCALE OF HUMANITY
4788-94904-0002 AS UPON THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS CERTAIN SPECIAL REQUISITES REQUISITES HOWEVER SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH THEIR DEGREE OF GENERAL ADVANCEMENT THAT ANY VARIATION BETWEEN THE TWO IS RATHER THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE
4788-94904-0004 WHO HAVE GAINED POWER OVER THE COUNTRY ARE DISPOSED TO OFFER IT THE BOON TO INDIVIDUAL REFORMERS THE QUESTION IS ALMOST IRRELEVANT SINCE IF NO OTHER OBJECTION CAN BE MADE TO THEIR ENTERPRISE THAN THAT THE OPINION OF THE NATION IS NOT YET ON THEIR SIDE
4788-94904-0005 THEY HAVE THE READY AND PROPER ANSWER THAT TO BRING IT OVER TO THEIR SIDE IS THE VERY END THEY AIM AT WHEN OPINION IS REALLY ADVERSE ITS HOSTILITY IS USUALLY TO THE FACT OF CHANGE RATHER THAN TO REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IN ITSELF
4788-94904-0007 WHETHER MONARCHICAL OR POPULAR IN ANY CASE IN WHICH THE ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS AT ALL LIKELY TO BE MADE INDIFFERENCE TO IT
4788-94904-0008 RATHER THAN POSITIVE OPPOSITION ARE THE OBSTACLES TO BE EXPECTED THESE HOWEVER ARE AS FATAL AND MAY BE AS HARD TO BE GOT RID OF AS ACTUAL AVERSION IT BEING EASIER IN MOST CASES TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF AN ACTIVE FEELING THAN TO CREATE ONE
4788-94904-0010 AND IS IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE PUBLIC TO IT PRINCIPALLY THE HOPES AND FEARS OF INDIVIDUALS ARE DIRECTED AND BY IT BOTH THE BENEFITS AND THE TERRORS AND PRESTIGE OF GOVERNMENT ARE MAINLY REPRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC EYE
4788-94904-0011 UNLESS THEREFORE THE AUTHORITIES WHOSE OFFICE IT IS TO CHECK THE EXECUTIVE ARE BACKED BY AN EFFECTIVE OPINION AND FEELING IN THE COUNTRY THE EXECUTIVE HAS ALWAYS THE MEANS OF SETTING THEM ASIDE OR COMPELLING THEM TO SUBSERVIENCE
4788-94904-0013 THEY SELDOM OBTAIN A FOOTING AT ALL AND IF THEY DO ARE ALMOST SURE TO BE OVERTHROWN AS SOON AS THE HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OR ANY PARTY LEADER WHO CAN MUSTER FORCE FOR A COUP DE MAIN IS WILLING TO RUN SOME SMALL RISK FOR ABSOLUTE POWER
4788-94904-0014 THESE CONSIDERATIONS RELATE TO THE FIRST TWO CAUSES OF FAILURE IN A REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT THE THIRD IS WHEN THE PEOPLE WANT EITHER THE WILL OR THE CAPACITY TO FULFILL THE PART WHICH BELONGS TO THEM IN A REPRESENTATIVE CONSTITUTION
4788-94904-0016 OR OF SOME ONE WITH WHOM THEY ARE CONNECTED AS ADHERENTS OR DEPENDENTS THE SMALL CLASS WHO IN THIS STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING GAIN THE COMMAND OF THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY FOR THE MOST PART USE IT SOLELY AS A MEANS OF SEEKING THEIR FORTUNE IF THE EXECUTIVE IS WEAK
4788-94904-0017 THE COUNTRY IS DISTRACTED BY MERE STRUGGLES FOR PLACE IF STRONG IT MAKES ITSELF DESPOTIC AT THE CHEAP PRICE OF APPEASING THE REPRESENTATIVES OR SUCH OF THEM AS ARE CAPABLE OF GIVING TROUBLE BY A SHARE OF THE SPOIL
4788-94904-0019 WHEN HOWEVER THE EVIL STOPS HERE THE PRICE MAY BE WORTH PAYING FOR THE PUBLICITY AND DISCUSSION WHICH THOUGH NOT AN INVARIABLE ARE A NATURAL ACCOMPANIMENT OF ANY EVEN NOMINAL REPRESENTATION
4788-94904-0020 THAT THE PLACE HUNTERS WHO CHIEFLY COMPOSE THE REPRESENTATIVE ASSEMBLY THOUGH THEY CONTRIBUTE LITTLE OR NOTHING DIRECTLY TO GOOD GOVERNMENT NOR EVEN MUCH TEMPER THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE EXECUTIVE
4788-94904-0022 THEY WOULD CERTAINLY AS IN SPANISH AMERICA KEEP THE COUNTRY IN A STATE OF CHRONIC REVOLUTION AND CIVIL WAR A DESPOTISM NOT EVEN LEGAL BUT OF ILLEGAL VIOLENCE WOULD BE ALTERNATELY EXERCISED BY A SUCCESSION OF POLITICAL ADVENTURERS
4788-94904-0023 AND THE NAME AND FORMS OF REPRESENTATION WOULD HAVE NO EFFECT BUT TO PREVENT DESPOTISM FROM ATTAINING THE STABILITY AND SECURITY BY WHICH ALONE ITS EVILS CAN BE MITIGATED OR ITS FEW ADVANTAGES REALIZED
4788-94904-0025 TO THE ACQUISITION OF WHICH REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT IS LIKELY TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT THE MOST OBVIOUS OF THESE CASES IS THE ONE ALREADY CONSIDERED IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE STILL TO LEARN THE FIRST LESSON OF CIVILIZATION THAT OF OBEDIENCE
4788-94904-0026 A RACE WHO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN ENERGY AND COURAGE BY STRUGGLES WITH NATURE AND THEIR NEIGHBORS BUT WHO HAVE NOT YET SETTLED DOWN INTO PERMANENT OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMON SUPERIOR WOULD BE LITTLE LIKELY TO ACQUIRE THIS HABIT UNDER THE COLLECTIVE GOVERNMENT OF THEIR OWN BODY
4788-94904-0028 A MILITARY LEADER IS THE ONLY SUPERIOR TO WHOM THEY WILL SUBMIT EXCEPT OCCASIONALLY SOME PROPHET SUPPOSED TO BE INSPIRED FROM ABOVE OR CONJURER REGARDED AS POSSESSING MIRACULOUS POWER THESE MAY EXERCISE A TEMPORARY ASCENDANCY
4788-94904-0029 BUT AS IT IS MERELY PERSONAL IT RARELY EFFECTS ANY CHANGE IN THE GENERAL HABITS OF THE PEOPLE UNLESS THE PROPHET LIKE MOHAMMED IS ALSO A MILITARY CHIEF AND GOES FORTH THE ARMED APOSTLE OF A NEW RELIGION
4788-94904-0031 AND READY SUBMISSION TO TYRANNY IF A PEOPLE THUS PROSTRATED BY CHARACTER AND CIRCUMSTANCES COULD OBTAIN REPRESENTATIVE INSTITUTIONS THEY WOULD INEVITABLY CHOOSE THEIR TYRANTS AS THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE YOKE WOULD BE MADE HEAVIER ON THEM BY THE CONTRIVANCE WHICH
4788-94904-0032 MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO LIGHTEN IT ON THE CONTRARY MANY A PEOPLE HAS GRADUALLY EMERGED FROM THIS CONDITION BY THE AID OF A CENTRAL AUTHORITY WHOSE POSITION HAS MADE IT THE RIVAL AND HAS ENDED BY MAKING IT THE MASTER OF THE LOCAL DESPOTS
4788-94904-0034 HE WAS THE OBJECT OF HOPE AND RELIANCE THROUGHOUT THE KINGDOM WHILE EACH LOCAL POTENTATE WAS ONLY POWERFUL WITHIN A MORE OR LESS CONFINED SPACE AT HIS HANDS REFUGE AND PROTECTION WERE SOUGHT FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY AGAINST FIRST ONE
4788-94904-0035 THEN ANOTHER OF THE IMMEDIATE OPPRESSORS HIS PROGRESS TO ASCENDANCY WAS SLOW BUT IT RESULTED FROM SUCCESSIVELY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES WHICH OFFERED THEMSELVES ONLY TO HIM IT WAS THEREFORE SURE AND IN PROPORTION AS IT WAS ACCOMPLISHED
4788-94904-0037 UNDER HIS PROTECTION NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES WERE FORMED WHICH KNEW NO ONE ABOVE THEM BUT THE KING
4788-94904-0038 AND THE MONARCH WAS LONG COMPELLED BY NECESSITIES OF POSITION TO EXERT HIS AUTHORITY AS THE ALLY RATHER THAN THE MASTER OF THE CLASSES WHOM HE HAD AIDED IN AFFECTING THEIR LIBERATION IN THIS MANNER A CENTRAL POWER DESPOTIC IN PRINCIPLE
4788-294466-0000 MARY'S NETTLESOME BROWN PONY WAS HARD TO QUIET UNTIL JERRY REACHED OUT A STRONG BROWN HAND AND PATTED ITS HEAD MARY LIFTED STARTLED BLUE EYES JERRY WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT SHE ASKED
4788-294466-0001 WE COULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED THAT GUN SHOT AND SURELY THE HORSES HEARD IT ALSO JERRY'S SMILE WAS REASSURING TWAS THE STORY THAT FRIGHTENED YOU GIRLS I RECKON HE SAID GLANCING ABOUT AND UP AND DOWN THE ROAD AS HE SPOKE
4788-294466-0003 HURRY ALONG HOME TO YOUR MILKING JERRY AND DICK DON'T YOU BOTHER TO COME WITH US NOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THE NEWCOMB RANCH YOU OUGHT TO BE THERE IT'S ONLY A FEW MILES UP OVER THIS SUNSHINY ROAD TO GLEESON WE AREN'T THE LEAST BIT AFRAID TO RIDE HOME ALONE ARE WE
4788-294466-0004 SHE SMILED AT HER FRIEND MARY NOT WISHING TO APPEAR FOOLISHLY TIMID SAID IN AS COURAGEOUS A VOICE AS SHE COULD MUSTER OF COURSE WE'RE NOT AFRAID GOODBYE BOYS WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
4788-294466-0006 THEY'RE NICE BOYS AREN'T THEY MARY SAID I'VE ALWAYS WISHED I HAD A BROTHER AND I DO BELIEVE JERRY IS GOING TO BE JUST LIKE ONE ALOUD DORA REPLIED I HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETIMES HE CALLS YOU LITTLE SISTER TO HERSELF SHE THOUGHT
4788-294466-0007 OH MARY HOW BLIND YOU ARE DREAMILY THE YOUNGER GIRL WAS SAYING THAT'S BECAUSE WE WERE PLAYMATES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE SO VERY LONG AGO OH MY HOW ANCIENT WE ARE DORA SAID TEASINGLY
4788-294466-0009 WHEN SHE SPOKE SHE SAID IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT JERRY SHOULD CALL ME LITTLE SISTER OUR MOTHERS WERE LIKE SISTERS WHEN THEY WERE GIRL BRIDES I'VE TOLD YOU HOW THEY BOTH CAME FROM THE EAST JUST AS WE HAVE MY MOTHER MET DAD IN BISBEE WHERE HE WAS A MINING ENGINEER
4788-294466-0010 AND JERRY'S MOTHER TAUGHT A LITTLE DESERT SCHOOL OVER NEAR THE NEWCOMB RANCH SHE DIDN'T TEACH LONG THOUGH FOR THAT VERY FIRST VACATION SHE MARRIED JERRY'S COWBOY FATHER AFTER THAT MOTHER AND MISSUS NEWCOMB WERE GOOD FRIENDS NATURALLY BEING BRIDES AND NEIGHBORS
4788-294466-0012 FAR BELOW THEM THE DESERT VALLEY STRETCHED MANY MILES SOUTHWARD TO THE MEXICAN BORDER THE GIRLS COULD SEE A DISTANT BLUE HAZE THAT WAS THE SMOKE FROM THE DOUGLAS COPPER SMELTERS THE LATE AFTERNOON SUN LAY IN FLOODS OF SILVER LIGHT ON THE SANDY ROAD AHEAD OF THEM
4788-294466-0013 IT WAS VERY STILL NOT A SOUND WAS TO BE HEARD NOW AND THEN A RABBIT DARTED PAST SILENTLY HOW PEACEFUL THIS HOUR IS ON THE DESERT MARY BEGAN GLANCING AT HER FRIEND WHO WAS RIDING SO CLOSE AT HER SIDE
4788-294466-0015 DORA NODDED SO HE SAID THEN SHE HASTENED TO ADD OH DON'T THINK I'M INFERRING THAT JERRY TOLD AN UNTRUTH BUT YOU KNOW THAT SOME EVENINGS HE HAS STAYED WITH US FOR SUPPER AND MARY GLANCED UP STARTLED DORA BELLMAN SHE SAID
4788-294466-0016 I DON'T BELIEVE HE WILL TELL US ABOUT THAT I ACTED SO LIKE A SCARE CAT ALL THE TIME WE WERE THERE HE WON'T EVER TAKE US THERE AGAIN AND HE PROBABLY WON'T TELL US THE STORY EITHER THEN I'LL FIND IT OUT SOME OTHER WAY DORA DECLARED
4788-294466-0018 IN THE LONG AGO DAYS WHEN THE TOWN HAD BEEN TEEMING WITH LIFE PICTURESQUE LOOKING MINERS AND RANCHERS HAD SAT THERE TILTED BACK SMOKING PIPES AND SWAPPING YARNS TODAY THE CHAIRS WERE EMPTY AN OLD MAN SHRIVELED
4788-294466-0019 GRAY BEARDED UNKEMPT BUT WITH KIND GRAY EYES DEEP SUNKEN UNDER SHAGGY BROWS STOOD IN THE OPEN DOOR HE SMILED OUT AT THEM IN A FRIENDLY WAY THEN BECKONED WITH A BONY FINGER
4788-294466-0021 DORA EXCLAIMED AS SHE RODE CLOSE TO THE PORCH THANKS A LOT SHE CALLED BRIGHTLY UP TO THE OLD MAN WHO WAS HANDING THE PACKET DOWN OVER THE SAGGING WOODEN RAIL HIS FRIENDLY TOOTHLESS SMILE WAS DIRECTED AT THE SMALLER GIRL
4788-294466-0022 HE SAID MIS FARLEY YER NURSE WOMAN CAME DOWN TER MAIL SOME LETTERS A SPELL BACK THEN BEFORE MARY COULD REPLY HE CONTINUED IN HIS SHRILL WAVERING VOICE
4788-294466-0025 BUSTIN BRONCS MARY SMILED IN APPRECIATION OF THE OLD MAN'S JOKE NO JERRY WON'T EXPECT DICK TO DO THAT RIGHT AT FIRST HE'S OFFICIAL FENCE MENDER JUST AT PRESENT DORA DEFENDED THE ABSENT BOY MISTER HARVEY
4788-294466-0026 YOU WAIT UNTIL DICK HAS BEEN ON THE DESERT LONG ENOUGH TO GET A COAT OF TAN HE MAY SURPRISE YOU
4788-294466-0028 A BRIGHT BLACK EYED MEXICAN BOY OF ABOUT TEN RAN OUT TO THE ROAD AS THE GIRLS APPROACHED COME ON EMANUEL MARY SANG DOWN TO HIM YOU MAY PUT UP OUR HORSES AND EARN A DIME THE SMALL BOY'S WHITE TEETH FLASHED IN A DELIGHTED GRIN
4788-294466-0029 HIS BROWN FEET RACED SO FAST THAT BY THE TIME THE GIRLS WERE DISMOUNTING BEFORE THE BIG SQUARE TWO STORIED ADOBE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS EMANUEL WAS THERE TO LEAD THEIR HORSES AROUND BACK MARY GLANCED AFFECTIONATELY AT THE OLD PLACE WITH ITS FLOWER EDGED WALK
4788-294466-0031 THEN GLANCING UP AT THE NURSE WHO HAD APPEARED FROM HER FATHER'S BEDROOM SHE ASKED EAGERLY MAY I TELL DAD AN ADVENTURE WE'VE HAD MISSUS FARLEY MIDDLE AGED KIND FACED SHOOK HER HEAD SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL NOT TONIGHT PLEASE WON'T TOMORROW DO
4813-248638-0000 A TOWN OF ENTERPRISE AND CHARACTER EVER SINCE THE FIRST WATER POWER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST POWDER MILL IN THIS COUNTRY THE FIRST CHOCOLATE MILL IN THIS COUNTRY AND THUS THROUGH A WHOLE LINE OF FIRST THINGS THE FIRST VIOLONCELLO
4813-248638-0002 AND OF CHARMING WALKS AND DRIVES AND VIEWS MANY OF THE OLD FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN THE TOWN ITS PRESTIGE STILL LIVE IN THEIR ANCESTRAL MANORS AND MANY OF THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE MOVED THERE IN RECENT YEARS
4813-248638-0003 AS THE STRANGER PASSES THROUGH MILTON HE IS CAPTIVATED BY GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT HOMESTEADS SETTLING BEHIND THEIR WHITE COLONIAL FENCES TOPPED WITH WHITE COLONIAL URNS HALF HIDDEN BY THEIR ANTIQUE TREES WITH AN AIR OF COMFORTABLE EASE
4813-248638-0005 BUT MODERN MILTON IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS AS OLD MILTON
4813-248638-0006 THAT SWIMS FOREVER AGAINST THE SKY THAT MARCHES FOREVER AROUND THE HORIZON THE ROUNDED SUMMITS OF THE BLUE HILLS TO WHICH THE EYE IS IRRESISTIBLY ATTRACTED BEFORE ENTERING THE TOWN WHICH PRINCIPALLY CLAIMS THEM ARE THE WORN DOWN STUMPS OF ANCIENT MOUNTAINS
4813-248638-0008 AND ARE THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURE OF THE SOUTHERN COAST FROM THEM THE MASSACHUSET TRIBE ABOUT THE BAY DERIVED ITS NAME SIGNIFYING NEAR THE GREAT HILLS WHICH NAME WAS CHANGED BY THE ENGLISH TO MASSACHUSETTS
4813-248638-0009 AND APPLIED TO BOTH BAY AND COLONY ALTHOUGH ITS INDIAN NAME HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM THIS LOVELY RANGE THE LOVELINESS REMAINS ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY SHIMMERS UNDER THE MYSTERIOUS BLOOM OF THESE HEIGHTS
4813-248638-0011 IT SEEMS TO HAVE A SINGULAR WAY OF MOVING FROM POINT TO POINT AS ONE MOTORS AND ALTHOUGH ONE MAY BE FORCED TO ADMIT THAT THIS MAY BE DUE MORE TO THE WINDING ROADS THAN TO THE ILLUSIVENESS OF THE HILL STILL THE BUOYANT EFFECT IS THE SAME
4813-248638-0012 RUSKIN DECLARES SOMEWHERE WITH HIS QUAINT AND CHARACTERISTIC MIXTURE OF POSITIVENESS AND IDEALISM THAT INHABITANTS OF GRANITE COUNTRIES
4813-248638-0014 EACH HAS THROUGH ITS OWN FAIR NAME DONE HONOR TO THE FAIR NAMES WHICH HAVE PRECEDED IT ONE OF THE VERY FIRST TO BE ATTRACTED BY THE LOFTY AND YET LOVELY APPEAL OF THIS REGION WAS GOVERNOR THOMAS HUTCHINSON
4813-248638-0015 AND THE WIDE FLAT TWIST OF THE NEPONSET RIVER WINDING THROUGH IT FOR ALL THE WORLD LIKE A DECORATIVE PANEL
4813-248638-0017 HE WALKED ON FOOT DOWN THE HILL SHAKING HANDS WITH HIS NEIGHBORS PATRIOT AND TORY ALIKE WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES AS HE LEFT BEHIND HIM THE GARDEN AND THE TREES HE HAD PLANTED AND THE HOUSE WHERE HE HAD SO HAPPILY LIVED
4813-248638-0018 THE VIEW FROM THE BACK HOLDS EVEN MORE INTIMATE ATTRACTION HERE IS THE OLD OLD GARDEN AND ALTHOUGH THE EPHEMERAL BLOSSOMS OF THE PRESENT SPRINGTIME SHINE BRIGHTLY FORTH THE BOX FULL TWENTY FEET HIGH SPEAKS OF ANOTHER EPOCH
4813-248638-0020 TWO OTHER MEN OF NOTE WHO SINCE THE DAYS OF OUR YEARS ARE BUT THREESCORE AND TEN CHOSE THAT THEIR DAYS WITHOUT NUMBER SHOULD BE SPENT IN THE TOWN THEY LOVED WERE WENDELL PHILLIPS AND RIMMER THE SCULPTOR WHO ARE BOTH BURIED AT MILTON
4813-248638-0021 NOT ONLY NOTABLE PERSONAGES BUT NOTABLE EVENTS HAVE BEEN ENGENDERED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THESE HILLS THE SUFFOLK RESOLVES WHICH WERE THE PRELUDE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WERE ADOPTED AT THE VOSE HOUSE
4813-248638-0023 WHEN THE FOURTH LIBERTY LOAN OF TWO MILLION NINE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WAS SUBSCRIBED FROM A POPULATION OF NINE THOUSAND ALL THE VARIOUS VICISSITUDES OF PEACE AND WAR HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED ON THE HIGH LEVEL
4813-248638-0024 THAT ONE MIGHT EXPECT FROM MEN AND WOMEN NOBLY NURTURED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS HOW MUCH OF ITS SUCCESS MILTON ATTRIBUTES TO ITS LOCATION FOR ONE JOINS INDEED A DISTINGUISHED FELLOWSHIP WHEN ONE BUILDS UPON A HILL
4813-248638-0026 OF ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND ACRES A LABYRINTH OF IDYLLIC FOOTPATHS AND LEAFY TRAILS OF TWISTING DRIVES AND WALKS THAT OPEN OUT UPON SUPERB VISTAS IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS THE GRANITE QUARRY MAN
4813-248638-0027 FAR MORE INTERESTED IN THE VALUE OF THE STONE THAT UNDERLAY THE WOODED SLOPES THAN IN RUSKIN'S THEORY OF ITS PURIFYING EFFECT UPON THE INHABITANTS HAD ALREADY OBTAINED A FOOTING HERE WHEN UNDER THE ABLE LEADERSHIP OF CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS
4813-248638-0029 THE RACE TRACK WITH ITS JUDGES STANDS IS STILL THERE BUT THERE ARE NO MORE HORSE RACES ALTHOUGH THE FORBES FAMILY STILL HOLDS A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
4813-248638-0030 YOU MAY SEE TOO A SOLITARY FIGURE WITH A SCIENTIST'S STOOP OR A TUTOR WITH A GROUP OF BOYS MAKING A FIRST HAND STUDY OF A REGION WHICH IS FULL OF INTEREST TO THE GEOLOGIST CIRCLING THUS AROUND THE BASE OF THE GREAT BLUE HILL
4813-248638-0032 ONCE AT THE TOP THE EYE IS OVERWHELMED BY A CIRCUIT OF MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES IT IS ALMOST TOO IMMENSE AT FIRST ALMOST AS BARREN AS AN EMPTY EXPANSE OF ROLLING GREEN SEA BUT AS THE EYE GROWS ACCUSTOMED TO THE STRETCHING DISTANCES
4813-248638-0033 OBJECTS BOTH NEAR AND FAR BEGIN TO APPEAR AND SOON IF THE DAY IS CLEAR BUILDINGS MAY BE IDENTIFIED IN MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE VILLAGES WE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE FEET ABOVE THE SEA ON THE HIGHEST COASTLAND
4813-248638-0035 AND FAR BEYOND THE HILLS OF ANDOVER AND GEORGETOWN A LITTLE TO THE EAST BOSTON WITH ITS GILDED DOME THEN THE HARBOR WITH ITS ISLANDS HEADLANDS AND FORTIFICATIONS
4813-248638-0036 AS FAR AS EASTERN POINT LIGHTHOUSE IN GLOUCESTER FORTY MILES TO THE NORTHEAST APPEAR THE TWIN LIGHTHOUSES ON THATCHER'S ISLAND SEEMING FROM HERE TO BE STANDING NOT ON THE LAND BUT OUT IN THE OCEAN
4813-248638-0038 AND THE POINTING FINGER OF MINOT'S LIGHT FACING NEARLY SOUTH THE LONG RIDGE OF MANOMET HILL IN PLYMOUTH THIRTY THREE MILES AWAY STANDS CLEAR AGAINST THE SKY WHILE TWENTY SIX MILES AWAY IN DUXBURY ONE SEES THE MYLES STANDISH MONUMENT
4813-248638-0039 AND FAR BEYOND IT IS THE GRAND MONADNOCK IN JAFFREY
4813-248638-0041 OF THE UNCANOONUC MOUNTAINS FIFTY NINE MILES AWAY THIS THEN IS THE GREAT BLUE HILL OF MILTON THOSE WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW ENGLAND CAN STAND HERE AND PICK OUT A HUNDRED DISTINGUISHING LANDMARKS
4813-248638-0042 AND THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN HERE BEFORE MAY FIND AN UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE WHOLE REGION AT ONE SWEEP OF THE EYE FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TOPOGRAPHY THE SUMMIT OF GREAT BLUE HILL IS THE PLACE TO REACH BUT FOR THE SENSE OF MYSTERIOUS BEAUTY
4813-248638-0044 ONE REMEMBERS STEVENSON'S OBSERVATION THAT SOMETIMES TO TRAVEL HOPEFULLY IS BETTER THAN TO ARRIVE SO LET US COME DOWN FOR AFTER ALL LOVE IS OF THE VALLEY DOWN AGAIN TO THE OLD TOWN OF MILTON
4813-248638-0045 WE HAVE NOT HALF BEGUN TO WANDER OVER IT NOT HALF BEGUN TO HEAR THE PLEASANT STORIES IT HAS TO TELL WHEN ONE IS AS OLD AS THIS FOR MILTON WAS DISCOVERED BY A BAND FROM PLYMOUTH WHO CAME UP THE NEPONSET RIVER IN SIXTEEN TWENTY ONE
4813-248638-0047 AND THOSE MILLS STAND UPON THE SITE OF THE FIRST GRIST MILL IN NEW ENGLAND TO BE RUN BY WATER POWER THIS WAS IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FOUR AND ONE LIKES TO PICTURE THE STURDY COLONISTS TRAILING INTO TOWN THEIR PACKS UPON THEIR BACKS
4813-248638-0048 LIKE CHILDREN IN KINDERGARTEN GAMES TO HAVE THEIR GRAIN GROUND ISRAEL STOUGHTON WAS THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO ESTABLISHED THIS FIRST MILL A NAME PERPETUATED
4813-248638-0050 SET AGAINST A STONE WALL NEAR ITS ORIGINAL SITE THIS EARLY CHURCH AND EARLY SCHOOL WAS A LOG CABIN WITH A THATCHED ROOF AND LATTICED WINDOWS IF ONE MAY BELIEVE THE RELIEF
4813-248638-0051 BUT MEN OF BRAINS AND CHARACTER WERE TAUGHT THERE LESSONS WHICH STOOD THEM AND THE COLONY IN GOOD STEAD ONE FANCIES THE STUDENTS ROVING EYES MAY HAVE OCCASIONALLY STRAYED DOWN THE INDIAN TRAIL DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE OLD SITE A TRAIL WHICH
4813-248638-0053 YONDER RAILROAD TRACK MARKS THE SPOT WHERE THE VERY FIRST TIE IN THE COUNTRY WAS LAID AND LAID FOR NO LESS SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE THAN TO FACILITATE THE CARRYING OF GRANITE BLOCKS FOR BUNKER HILL MONUMENT FROM THEIR QUARRY TO THE HARBOR GRANITE FROM THE HILLS
4813-248638-0054 AGAIN WE ARE DRAWN BACK TO THE IRRESISTIBLE MAGNET OF THOSE MIGHTY MONITORS YES WHEREVER ONE GOES IN MILTON EITHER ON FOOT TO DAY OR BACK THROUGH THE CHAPTERS OF THREE CENTURIES AGO THE BLUE HILLS DOMINATE EVERY EVENT
4813-248641-0000 MANY OF THE CARS ARE MODERATELY PRICED AFFAIRS THE TONNEAU WELL FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF MISCELLANEOUS AGES AND ENLIVENED BY A FAMILY DOG OR TWO FOR THIS IS THE WAY THAT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SPENDS ITS MODERN SABBATH HOLIDAY
4813-248641-0001 FOR A ROAD ORIGINALLY MARKED BY THE MOCCASINED FEET OF INDIANS AND WIDENED GRADUALLY BY THE TOILSOME JOURNEYINGS OF ROUGH COLONIAL CARTS AND COACHES
4813-248641-0003 SUCH A SHORT TIME AGO A WILDERNESS COULD PRODUCE NOT AS THE FINEST FLOWER ON ITS TREE OF EVOLUTION BUT CERTAINLY AS ITS MOST EXOTIC THE PLUTOCRAT WHO LIVES IN A PALACE WITH FIFTY SERVANTS TO DO HIS BIDDING
4813-248641-0004 AND THE FINE LADY WHOSE SOLE EXERCISE OF HER MENTAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS CONSISTS IN ALLOWING HER MAID TO DRESS HER YES NEW ENGLAND HAS CHANGED AMAZINGLY IN THE REVOLUTIONS OF THREE CENTURIES
4813-248641-0006 THIS WOODEN MEETING HOUSE WITH THE TRUNCATED PYRAMIDAL ROOF AND BELFRY TO SERVE AS A LOOKOUT STATION HAS JUST BEEN BUILT A STAGE AHEAD ARCHITECTURALLY OF THE LOG MEETING HOUSE WITH CLAY FILLED CHINKS THATCHED ROOF OILED PAPER WINDOWS
4813-248641-0007 EARTHEN FLOOR AND A STAGE BEHIND THE CHARMING STEEPLE STYLE MADE POPULAR BY SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN AND NOW MULTIPLIED IN COUNTLESS GRACEFUL EXAMPLES ALL OVER NEW ENGLAND
4813-248641-0009 IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN EIGHTY ONE IT IS MERELY THE NEW MEETING HOUSE OF THE LITTLE HAMLET OF HINGHAM THE PEOPLE ARE VERY PROUD OF THEIR NEW BUILDING THE TIMBERS HAVE BEEN HEWN WITH THE BROAD AXE OUT OF SOLID WHITE PINE
4813-248641-0010 THE MARKS ARE STILL VISIBLE PARTICULARLY IN THOSE RAFTERS OF THE ROOF OPEN TO THE ATTIC THE BELFRY IS PRECISELY IN THE CENTER OF THE FOUR SIDED PITCHED ROOF TO BE SURE THIS NECESSITATES RINGING THE BELL FROM ONE OF THE PEWS
4813-248641-0012 NO PAINT NO DECORATIONS NO COLORED WINDOWS NO ORGAN OR ANYTHING WHICH COULD EVEN REMOTELY SUGGEST THE COLOR THE BEAUTY THE FORMALISM OF THE CHURCHES OF ENGLAND
4813-248641-0013 SINCE IN SIXTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE GENERAL COURT DECREED THAT NO DWELLING
4813-248641-0015 EACH TEN FAMILIES IS UNDER AN INSPECTOR IF THERE IS ANY QUESTION OF DELINQUENTS HIDING IN THEM AND SO IN TWOS AND THREES OFTEN THE MAN TRUDGING AHEAD WITH HIS GUN AND THE WOMAN CARRYING HER BABY WHILE THE SMALLER CHILDREN CLING TO HER SKIRTS
4813-248641-0016 SOMETIMES MAN AND WOMAN AND A CHILD OR TWO ON HORSEBACK NO MATTER HOW WILD THE STORM HOW SWOLLEN THE STREAMS HOW DEEP THE WHIRLING SNOW THEY ALL COME TO CHURCH
4813-248641-0018 AND THE SLAVES AND INDIANS ARE IN THE REAR TO SEAT ONE'S SELF IN THE WRONG PUE IS AN OFFENSE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE HERE IS THE CHURCH AND HERE ARE THE PEOPLE AS THE OLD RHYME HAS IT WHAT THEN OF THE SERVICES
4813-248641-0019 THAT THEY ARE INTERMINABLE WE KNOW THE TITHING MAN OR CLERK MAY TURN THE BRASS BOUND HOURGLASS BY THE SIDE OF THE PULPIT TWO AND THREE TIMES DURING THE SERMON AND ONCE OR TWICE DURING THE PRAYER INTERMINABLE
4813-248641-0021 THEY STAND TOO WHILE THE PSALMS AND HYMNS ARE LINED OUT AND AS THEY SING THEM VERY UNCERTAINLY AND VERY INCORRECTLY THIS PERFORMANCE ALONE SOMETIMES TAKES AN HOUR AS THERE IS NO ORGAN NOR NOTES
4813-248641-0022 AND ONLY A FEW COPIES OF THE BAY PSALM BOOK OF WHICH BY THE WAY A COPY NOW WOULD BE WORTH MANY TIMES ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD AFTER THE MORNING SERVICE THERE IS A NOON INTERMISSION IN WHICH THE HALF FROZEN CONGREGATION STIRS AROUND
4813-248641-0024 THESE EXTERNAL TRAPPINGS OF THE SERVICE SOUND DEPRESSING ENOUGH BUT IF THE MESSAGE RECEIVED WITHIN THESE CHILLY WALLS IS CHEERING MAYBE WE CAN FORGET OR IGNORE THE PHYSICAL DISCOMFORTS BUT IS THE MESSAGE CHEERING HELL DAMNATION ETERNAL TORTURES
4813-248641-0025 PAINFUL THEOLOGICAL HAIR SPLITTINGS HARROWING SELF EXAMINATIONS AND HUMILIATING PUBLIC CONFESSIONS THIS IS WHAT THEY GATHER ON THE NARROW WOODEN BENCHES TO LISTEN TO HOUR AFTER HOUR SEARCHING THEIR SOULS FOR SIN WITH AN ALMOST FRENZIED EAGERNESS
4813-248641-0027 FROM THE MOTHER CHURCH AND THE MOTHER COUNTRY AND FORTIFY THEM IN THEIR STRUGGLE IN A NEW LAND IT WAS RELIGIOUS ZEAL WHICH FURNISHED THIS MOTIVE POWER DIFFERENT IMPLEMENTS AND DIFFERENTLY DIRECTED FORCE ARE NEEDED TO EXTRACT THE DIAMOND FROM THE EARTH
4813-248641-0028 HAVING DONE ITS WORK HAVING FOUNDED SOUNDLY AND PEOPLED STRONGLY AN EXCEPTIONAL REGION THE NEW ENGLAND CONSCIENCE HAD NO FURTHER NECESSITY FOR BEING THOSE WHOM IT NOW TORTURES WITH ITS HOT PINCERS OF DOUBT AND SELF REPROACH
4813-248641-0030 BY THEIR SELF IMPOSED RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCE AND THIS MORAL STAMINA HAS MARKED NEW ENGLAND EVER SINCE AND MARKED HER TO HER GLORY ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM CHURCHES INDEED ONE CANNOT SPEAK OF HINGHAM
4813-248641-0031 WITHOUT ADMIRING MENTION OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH THIS BUILDING OF EXQUISITE PROPORTIONS AND FINISH WITHIN AND WITHOUT BUILT BY BULFINCH IN EIGHTEEN O SIX IS ONE OF THE MOST FLAWLESS EXAMPLES OF ITS TYPE ON THE SOUTH SHORE
4813-248641-0033 BUT THE UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE NEW NORTH CHURCH IS ITS SLAVE GALLERIES THESE TWO SMALL GALLERIES BETWEEN THE ROOF AND THE CHOIR LOFT HELD FOR THIRTY YEARS IN DIMINISHING NUMBERS NEGROES AND INDIANS
4813-248641-0034 THE LAST OCCUPANT WAS A BLACK LUCRETIA WHO AFTER BEING FREED WAS INVITED TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS WITH HER MASTER AND MISTRESS WHICH SHE DID AND WHICH SHE CONTINUED TO DO UNTIL HER DEATH NOT SO VERY LONG AGO
4813-248641-0036 EVEN MOTORING THROUGH TOO QUICKLY AS MOTORISTS MUST ONE CANNOT HELP BEING STRUCK BY THE SUBSTANTIAL DIGNITY OF THE PLACE BY THE WELL KEPT PROSPERITY OF THE HOUSES LARGE AND SMALL WHICH FRINGE THE FINE OLD HIGHWAY
4813-248641-0037 THE TOWN HAS PRESERVED A CRANFORD LIKE CHARM AND WHY NOT WHEN THE VERY HOUSE IS STILL HANDSOMELY PRESERVED WHERE THE NAMELESS NOBLEMAN FRANCIS LE BARON WAS CONCEALED BETWEEN THE FLOORS
4813-248641-0039 NAMED AFTER THE INDIAN CHIEF WHO GRANTED THE ORIGINAL DEEDS OF THE TOWN HAS FOUND QUARTERS IN AN EXTREMELY INTERESTING HOUSE DATING FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY IN THE SPACIOUS LIVING ROOM ARE SEVENTEEN PANELS ON THE WALLS AND IN THE DOORS
4813-248641-0040 PAINTED WITH CHARMING OLD FASHIONED SKILL BY JOHN HAZLITT THE BROTHER OF THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST THE REVEREND DANIEL SHUTE HOUSE BUILT IN SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IS PRACTICALLY INTACT WITH ITS PANELED ROOMS
4813-248641-0042 SHELTERED IN ITS PRIME NINE GENERATIONS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE RAINBOW ROOF HOUSE SO CALLED FROM THE DELICIOUS CURVE IN ITS ROOF IS ONE OF HINGHAM'S PRETTIEST TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD COTTAGES AND MISS SUSAN B WILLARD'S COTTAGE
4813-248641-0043 IS ONE OF THE OLDEST IN THE UNITED STATES DERBY ACADEMY FOUNDED ALMOST TWO CENTURIES AND A HALF AGO BY MADAM DERBY STILL MAINTAINS ITS SOCIAL AND SCHOLARLY PRESTIGE THROUGH ALL THE EDUCATIONAL TURMOIL OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
4813-248641-0045 LATER ANOTHER GOVERNOR JOHN D LONG WAS FOR MANY YEARS A MIGHTY FIGURE IN THE TOWN WITH ITS ANCIENT CHURCHES AND INSTITUTIONS ITS PENSIVE GRAVEYARDS AND LOVELY ELMS
4813-248641-0046 HINGHAM TYPIFIES WHAT IS QUAINTEST AND BEST IN NEW ENGLAND TOWNS POSSIBLY THE DAPPLING OF THE ELMS POSSIBLY THE SHADOW OF THE OLD SHIP CHURCH
4813-248641-0048 FOR WHEN DID RELIGION AND WARFARE NOT GO HAND IN HAND DURING THE TROUBLE WITH KING PHILIP THE TOWN HAD THREE FORTS ONE AT FORT HILL ONE AT THE CEMETERY AND ONE ON THE PLAIN ABOUT A MILE FROM THE HARBOR AND THE SITES MAY STILL BE IDENTIFIED
4813-248641-0049 WERE LANDED ON THEIR SALTY DECKS FOR FIFTY YEARS BETWEEN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN AND EIGHTEEN SIXTY THE RAPID SAILED AS A PACKET BETWEEN THIS TOWN AND BOSTON MAKING THE TRIP ON ONE MEMORABLE OCCASION IN SIXTY SEVEN MINUTES
4813-248641-0051 OR WOULD THEY REALIZE THAT THEIR SOWING HAD BROUGHT FORTH RICHER FRUIT THAN THEY COULD GUESS IT HAS ALL CHANGED SINCE PURITAN DAYS AND YET PERHAPS IN NO OTHER PLACE IN NEW ENGLAND DOES THE HAND OF THE PAST LIE SO VISIBLY UPON THE COMMUNITY
4813-248641-0052 YOU CANNOT LIFT YOUR EYES BUT THEY REST UPON SOME BUILDING RAISED TWO CENTURIES AND MORE AGO THE SHADE WHICH RIPPLES UNDER YOUR FEET IS CAST BY ELMS PLANTED BY THAT VERY HAND OF THE PAST EVEN YOUR VOICE REPEATS THE WORDS WHICH THOSE OLD PATRIARCHS
4813-248641-0054 ARE FROM THE GOOD BOOK ITSELF WHICH WAY TO EGYPT IS THIS AN ECHO FROM THAT TIME WHEN THE BIBLE WAS THE CORNER STONE OF CHURCH AND STATE OF HOME AND SCHOOL WHAT'S THE BEST ROAD TO JERICHO BEACH SURELY IT IS SOME GRAVE FACED SHADE WHO CALLS
4830-25898-0000 THERE NEVER WAS A PROUDER MAMMA THAN MADAM CLUCK WHEN SHE LED FORTH HER FAMILY OF EIGHT DOWNY LITTLE CHICKS CHANTICLEER STRUT SNOWBALL SPECKLE PEEP PECK DOWNY AND BLOT WERE THEIR NAMES
4830-25898-0002 BUT POOR MADAM CLUCK HAD BAD LUCK WITH HER CHICKS FOR THEY WERE HER FIRST AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEM OLD AUNT COCKLETOP TOLD HER THAT SHE DIDN'T AND PREDICTED THAT THOSE POOR DEARS WOULD COME TO BAD ENDS
4830-25898-0003 AUNT COCKLETOP WAS RIGHT AS YOU WILL SEE WHEN I HAVE TOLD THE SAD HISTORY OF THIS UNFORTUNATE FAMILY THE TRAGEDY BEGAN WITH CHANTY WHO WAS THE BOLDEST LITTLE COCKADOODLE WHO EVER TRIED TO CROW
4830-25898-0005 THE DUCKLINGS GOSLINGS AND YOUNG TURKEYS AND WAS SO DISAGREEABLE THAT ALL THE FOWLS HATED HIM ONE DAY A PAIR OF BANTAMS ARRIVED PRETTY LITTLE WHITE BIRDS WITH RED CRESTS AND NICE YELLOW FEET
4830-25898-0006 CHANTY THOUGHT HE COULD BEAT MISTER BANTAM EASILY HE WAS SO SMALL AND INVITED HIM TO FIGHT MISTER B DECLINED THEN CHANTY CALLED HIM A COWARD AND GAVE MISSUS B A PECK
4830-25898-0008 SITTING SIDE BY SIDE THE PLUMP SISTERS WERE PLACIDLY SWAYING UP AND DOWN OVER THE CLEAR BROWN WATER RIPPLING BELOW WHEN AH SAD TO RELATE THE STEM BROKE AND DOWN WENT LEAF
4830-25898-0009 CHICKENS AND ALL TO A WATERY DEATH I'M THE MOST UNLUCKY HEN EVER HATCHED GROANED
4830-25898-0011 WHAT A NICE TIME SPECKLE DID HAVE TO BE SURE FOR THE GRASSHOPPERS WERE LIVELY AND FAT AND AUNT WAS IN AN UNUSUALLY AMIABLE MOOD NEVER RUN AWAY FROM ANYTHING BUT FACE DANGER AND CONQUER IT
4830-25898-0012 LIKE A BRAVE CHICK SAID THE OLD BIDDY AS SHE WENT CLUCKING THROUGH THE GRASS WITH HER GRAY TURBAN WAGGING IN THE WIND SPECKLE HAD HOPPED AWAY FROM A TOAD WITH A STARTLED CHIRP WHICH CAUSED AUNT TO UTTER THAT REMARK
4830-25898-0014 AND UNCONSCIOUS OF THE DANGER STOOD HER GROUND AS A GREAT HAWK CAME CIRCLING NEARER AND NEARER TILL WITH A SUDDEN DART HE POUNCED ON THE POOR CHICKEN AND BORE IT AWAY CHIRPING DISMALLY
4830-25898-0015 WHAT SHALL I DO IT WAS A DREADFUL BLOW TO MISSUS CLUCK AND AUNT COCKLETOP DIDN'T SHOW HERSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY AFTER THAT STORY WAS KNOWN
4830-25898-0017 HE WAS AT IT FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT AND EVERYONE WAS TIRED TO DEATH OF HEARING HIS SHRILL SMALL VOICE MAKING FUNNY ATTEMPTS TO PRODUCE HOARSE LITTLE CROWS AS HE SAT ON THE WALL AND STRETCHED HIS YELLOW NECK
4830-25898-0018 TILL HIS THROAT QUITE ACHED WITH THE EFFORT AH IF I COULD ONLY FLY TO THE HIGHEST BEAM IN THE BARN AND GIVE A SPLENDID CROW THAT EVERYONE COULD HEAR I SHOULD BE PERFECTLY HAPPY SAID THIS SILLY LITTLE FOWL

4830-25898-0023 FOR POOR STRUT HE LEANED SO FAR FORWARD IN HIS FRANTIC EFFORT TO GET A BIG CROW OUT THAT HE TOPPLED OVER AND FELL BUMP ON THE HARD BARN FLOOR KILLING HIMSELF INSTANTLY
4830-25898-0024 FOR SOME TIME AFTER THIS MISSUS CLUCK KEPT HER THREE REMAINING LITTLE ONES CLOSE TO HER SIDE WATCHING OVER THEM WITH MATERNAL CARE TILL THEY WERE HEARTILY TIRED OF HER ANXIOUS CLUCKINGS PEEP AND PECK WERE ALWAYS TOGETHER
4830-25898-0026 EATING EVERYTHING SHE COULD FIND AND OFTEN MAKING HERSELF ILL BY GOBBLING TOO FAST AND FORGETTING TO EAT A LITTLE GRAVEL TO HELP DIGEST HER FOOD DON'T GO OUT OF THE BARN CHILDREN I'M GOING TO LAY AN EGG
4830-25898-0027 AND CAN'T LOOK AFTER YOU JUST NOW SAID THEIR MOTHER ONE DAY YES MA'AM CHIRPED THE CHICKENS AND THEN AS SHE WENT RUSTLING INTO THE HAY MOW THEY BEGAN TO RUN ABOUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES WITH ALL THEIR MIGHT

4830-25898-0030 SAM NEVER SAW HER BUT SHUT DOWN THE COVER OF THE BIN AS HE PASSED AND LEFT POOR PEEP TO DIE NO ONE KNEW WHAT HAD BECOME OF HER TILL SOME DAYS LATER WHEN SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN THE MEAL
4830-25898-0032 SHE STRAYED INTO THE SHEEP SHED AND FINDING SOME SALT ATE AS MUCH AS SHE LIKED NOT KNOWING THAT SALT IS BAD FOR HENS HAVING TAKEN ALL SHE WANTED SHE RAN BACK TO THE BARN
4830-25898-0033 AND WAS INNOCENTLY CATCHING GNATS WHEN HER MAMMA CAME OUT OF THE HAY MOW WITH A LOUD CUT CUT CUT
4830-25898-0035 THERE PECK STOPPED SUDDENLY ROLLED UP HER EYES AND BEGAN TO STAGGER ABOUT AS IF SHE WAS TIPSY MERCY ON US WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THE CHICK CRIED MISSUS CLUCK IN GREAT ALARM FITS MA'AM ANSWERED DOCTOR DRAKE

4830-25898-0038 GASPING AND ROLLING UP HER EYES IN GREAT ANGUISH FOR SHE HAD EATEN TOO MUCH OF THE FATAL SALT AND THERE WAS NO HELP FOR HER WHEN ALL WAS OVER THEY BURIED THE DEAD CHICKEN UNDER A CURRANT BUSH COVERED THE LITTLE GRAVE WITH CHICKWEED
4830-25898-0039 AND THE BEREAVED PARENT WORE A BLACK STRING ROUND HER LEG FOR A MONTH BLOT THE LAST OF THAT BRIGHT BAND NEEDED NO MOURNING FOR SHE WAS AS BLACK AS A CROW THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HER MOTHER NEVER
4830-25898-0041 FOR BLOT WAS A GREAT COMFORT TO HER NEVER RUNNING AWAY OR DISOBEYING IN ANY WAY BUT ALWAYS CLOSE TO HER SIDE READY TO CREEP UNDER HER WING OR BRING HER A PLUMP BUG WHEN THE POOR BIDDY'S APPETITE FAILED HER
4830-25898-0042 THEY WERE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER TILL THANKSGIVING DREW NEAR WHEN A DREADFUL PESTILENCE SEEMED TO SWEEP THROUGH THE FARM YARD FOR TURKEYS HENS DUCKS AND GEESE FELL A PREY TO IT
4830-25898-0044 AND PEEPING DOWN FROM HER PERCH SAW A GREAT HAND GLIDE ALONG THE ROOST CLUTCH HER BELOVED MOTHER BY THE LEG AND PULL HER OFF SCREAMING DOLEFULLY
4830-25898-0045 AUNT COCKLETOP PECKED AND CROAKED FIERCELY BUT TOUGH AS SHE WAS THE OLD BIDDY DID NOT ESCAPE AND MANY ANOTHER AMIABLE HEN AND GALLANT COCKADOODLE FELL A VICTIM TO THAT MYSTERIOUS HAND
4830-25898-0047 AND LONGING TO JOIN HER FAMILY IN SOME SAFE AND HAPPY LAND WHERE FOWLS LIVE IN PEACE SHE HAD HER WISH VERY SOON FOR ONE DAY WHEN THE FIRST SNOWFLAKES BEGAN TO FLUTTER
4830-25898-0048 BLOT SAW A LITTLE KITTEN MEWING PITIFULLY AS IT SAT UNDER THE FENCE WHAT IS THE MATTER DEAR ASKED KIND BLOT
4830-25898-0050 BUT IT WAS A LONG WAY AND DUSK CAME ON BEFORE THE RED FARM HOUSE APPEARED NOW I'M SAFE THANK YOU VERY MUCH WON'T YOU COME IN AND STAY ALL NIGHT MY MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU
4830-25898-0051 SAID THE KIT RUBBING HER SOFT WHITE FACE AGAINST BLOT'S LITTLE BLACK BREAST
4830-25898-0053 AND COLDER AND COLDER BECAME POOR BLOT'S LITTLE FEET AS SHE WADED THROUGH THE DRIFTS THE FIRELIGHT WAS SHINING OUT INTO THE GLOOM
4830-25898-0054 TO FIND ALL DOORS SHUT AND NO SHELTER LEFT FOR HER BUT THE BOUGH OF A LEAFLESS TREE TOO STIFF AND WEAK TO FLY UP SHE CREPT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO THE BRIGHT GLOW WHICH SHONE ACROSS THE DOOR STEP
4830-25904-0000 BEING ALONE IN LONDON YET WISHING TO CELEBRATE THE DAY I DECIDED TO PAY MY RESPECTS TO THE LIONS AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS A LOVELY PLACE IT WAS AND I ENJOYED MYSELF IMMENSELY FOR MAY DAY IN ENGLAND IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE
4830-25904-0001 MILD SUNNY FLOWERY AND SPRING LIKE AS I WALKED ALONG THE WELL KEPT PATHS BETWEEN WHITE AND ROSY HAWTHORN HEDGES I KEPT COMING UPON NEW AND CURIOUS SIGHTS
4830-25904-0003 AND I WAS SO GLAD TO MEET WITH ANY ONE FROM HOME THAT I'D HAVE PATTED HIM WITH PLEASURE IF HE HAD SHOWN ANY CORDIALITY TOWARD ME HE DIDN'T HOWEVER
4830-25904-0004 AND PUT DOWN HIS IMMENSE HEAD WITH A SULLEN SNORT AS IF HE'D HAVE TOSSED ME WITH GREAT SATISFACTION I DID NOT BLAME HIM FOR THE POOR FELLOW WAS HOMESICK DOUBTLESS FOR HIS OWN WIDE PRAIRIES AND THE FREE LIFE HE HAD LOST
4830-25904-0006 THEY HAD JUST HAD THEIR BATH AND STOOD ARRANGING THEIR FEATHERS WITH THEIR GREAT BILLS
4830-25904-0007 WHEN FED THEY GOBBLED UP THE FISH NEVER STOPPING TO SWALLOW IT TILL THE POUCHES UNDER THEIR BILLS WERE FULL THEN THEY LEISURELY EMPTIED THEM AND SEEMED TO ENJOY THEIR LUNCH WITH THE GRAVE DELIBERATION OF REGULAR ENGLISHMEN
4830-25904-0009 ONE LIONESS WAS ILL AND LAY ON HER BED LOOKING VERY PENSIVE WHILE HER MATE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT HER EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO DO SOMETHING FOR HER AND MUCH AFFLICTED BY HER SUFFERING
4830-25904-0010 I LIKED THIS LION VERY MUCH FOR THOUGH THE BIGGEST HE WAS VERY GENTLE AND HAD A NOBLE FACE THE TIGERS WERE RUSHING ABOUT AS TIGERS USUALLY ARE SOME CREEPING NOISELESSLY TO AND FRO
4830-25904-0012 IT WAS A VERY LOUD AND LARGE PURR BUT NO FIRESIDE PUSSY COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER AND EVERY ONE LAUGHED AT THE SOUND THERE WERE PRETTY SPOTTED LEOPARDS PANTHERS AND SMALLER VARIETIES OF THE SAME SPECIES
4830-25904-0013 I SAT WATCHING THEM A LONG TIME LONGING TO LET SOME OF THE WILD THINGS OUT FOR A GOOD RUN THEY SEEMED SO UNHAPPY BARRED IN THOSE SMALL DENS SUDDENLY THE LIONS BEGAN TO ROAR THE TIGERS TO SNARL
4830-25904-0015 THIS WAS THEIR DINNER AND AS THEY WERE FED BUT ONCE A DAY THEY WERE RAVENOUS SUCH ROARS AND HOWLS AND CRIES AS AROSE WHILE THE MAN WENT SLOWLY DOWN THE LINE
4830-25904-0016 GAVE ONE A GOOD IDEA OF THE SOUNDS TO BE HEARD IN INDIAN FORESTS AND JUNGLES THE LIONS BEHAVED BEST FOR THEY ONLY PACED UP AND DOWN WITH AN OCCASIONAL CRY BUT THE TIGERS WERE QUITE FRANTIC
4830-25904-0018 ONE LADY HAD A FRIGHT FOR THE WIND BLEW THE END OF HER SHAWL WITHIN REACH OF A TIGER'S GREAT CLAW AND HE CLUTCHED IT TRYING TO DRAG HER NEARER THE SHAWL CAME OFF AND THE POOR LADY RAN AWAY SCREAMING
4830-25904-0019 AS IF A WHOLE FAMILY OF WILD BEASTS WERE AFTER HER
4830-25904-0021 ONE LITTLE LEOPARD WAS BETTER BRED THAN THE OTHERS FOR HE WENT UP ON A SHELF IN THE CAGE AND ATE HIS DINNER IN A QUIET PROPER MANNER WHICH WAS AN EXAMPLE TO THE REST THE LIONS ATE IN DIGNIFIED SILENCE
4830-25904-0022 ALL BUT MY FAVOURITE WHO CARRIED HIS SHARE TO HIS SICK MATE AND BY EVERY GENTLE MEANS IN HIS POWER TRIED TO MAKE HER EAT SHE WAS TOO ILL HOWEVER AND TURNED AWAY WITH A PLAINTIVE MOAN WHICH SEEMED TO GRIEVE HIM SADLY
4830-25904-0024 AS I TOOK A LAST LOOK AT HIS FINE OLD FACE I NAMED HIM DOUGLAS AND WALKED AWAY HUMMING TO MYSELF THE LINES OF THE BALLAD DOUGLAS DOUGLAS TENDER AND TRUE
4830-25904-0025 AS A CONTRAST TO THE WILD BEASTS I WENT TO SEE THE MONKEYS WHO LIVED IN A FINE LARGE HOUSE ALL TO THEMSELVES HERE WAS EVERY VARIETY FROM THE GREAT UGLY CHIMPANZEE TO THE FUNNY LITTLE FELLOWS
4830-25904-0027 HE WAS A CROSS OLD PARTY AND SAT HUDDLED UP IN THE STRAW SCOWLING AT EVERY ONE LIKE AN ILL TEMPERED OLD BACHELOR HALF A DOZEN LITTLE ONES TEASED HIM CAPITALLY BY DROPPING BITS OF BREAD
4830-25904-0028 NUT SHELLS AND STRAWS DOWN ON HIM FROM ABOVE AS THEY CLIMBED ABOUT THE PERCHES OR SWUNG BY THEIR TAILS ONE POOR LITTLE CHAP HAD LOST THE CURLY END OF HIS TAIL I'M AFRAID THE GRAY ONE BIT IT OFF
4830-25904-0030 BOUNCE ON TO THE STRAW AT FIRST HE'D SIT AND STARE ABOUT HIM AS IF MUCH AMAZED TO FIND HIMSELF THERE THEN HE'D SCRATCH HIS LITTLE ROUND HEAD AND BEGIN TO SCOLD VIOLENTLY WHICH SEEMED TO DELIGHT THE OTHER MONKEYS
4830-25904-0031 AND FINALLY HE'D EXAMINE HIS POOR LITTLE TAIL AND APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND THE MISFORTUNE WHICH HAD BEFALLEN HIM THE FUNNY EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE WAS IRRESISTIBLE AND I ENJOYED SEEING HIM VERY MUCH
4830-25904-0033 SINCE I HAD A TAME GREEN ONE WHO LIVED UNDER THE DOOR STEP AND WOULD COME OUT AND PLAY WITH ME ON SUNNY DAYS THESE SNAKES I FOUND VERY INTERESTING ONLY THEY GOT UNDER THEIR BLANKETS AND WOULDN'T COME OUT AND I WASN'T ALLOWED TO POKE THEM
4830-25904-0034 AND BLINKED AT ME THROUGH THE GLASS LOOKING QUITE AS DANGEROUS AS HE WAS THERE WERE BIG AND LITTLE SNAKES BLACK BROWN AND SPECKLED LIVELY AND LAZY PRETTY AND PLAIN ONES BUT I LIKED THE GREAT BOA
4830-25904-0036 OUT I SAID TO MYSELF THINKING OF A STORY I READ ONCE OF A PERSON IN A MENAGERIE WHO TURNED SUDDENLY AND SAW A GREAT BOA GLIDING TOWARDS HIM
4830-25904-0037 AS I STOOD WONDERING IF THE BIG WORM COULD BE UNDER THE LITTLE FLAT BLANKET BEFORE ME THE BRANCH BEGAN TO MOVE ALL AT ONCE AND WITH A START I SAW A LIMB SWING DOWN TO STARE AT ME WITH THE BOA'S GLITTERING EYES
4830-25904-0039 WHERE SUCH UNPLEASANT NEIGHBOURS MIGHT POP IN UPON YOU UNEXPECTEDLY HE WAS KIND ENOUGH TO TAKE A PROMENADE AND SHOW ME HIS SIZE WHICH SEEMED IMMENSE AS HE STRETCHED HIMSELF
4830-25904-0040 AND THEN KNOTTED HIS ROUGH GRAYISH BODY INTO A GREAT LOOP WITH THE FIERY EYED HEAD IN THE MIDDLE HE WAS NOT ONE OF THE LARGEST KIND BUT I WAS QUITE SATISFIED AND LEFT HIM TO HIS DINNER OF RABBITS
4830-25904-0042 MUCH TO THE AMUSEMENT OF SOME CHILDREN RIDING ON THE ELEPHANT WHOSE TRUNK HAD FRIGHTENED ME HE HAD POLITELY TRIED TO TELL ME TO CLEAR THE WAY WHICH I CERTAINLY HAD DONE WITH ALL SPEED PICKING MYSELF OUT OF THE HEDGE
4830-25904-0043 I WALKED BESIDE HIM EXAMINING HIS CLUMSY FEET AND PEERING UP AT HIS SMALL INTELLIGENT EYE I'M VERY SURE HE WINKED AT ME AS IF ENJOYING THE JOKE AND KEPT POKING HIS TRUNK INTO MY POCKET
4830-25904-0045 ON THEIR LONG SCARLET LEGS STRIPED ZEBRAS RACING IN THEIR PADDOCK QUEER KANGAROOS HOPPING ABOUT WITH LITTLE ONES IN THEIR POUCHES PRETTY ANTELOPES CHASING ONE ANOTHER
4830-25904-0046 AND IN AN IMMENSE WIRE COVERED AVIARY ALL SORTS OF BRILLIANT BIRDS WERE FLYING ABOUT AS GAILY AS IF AT HOME ONE OF THE CURIOSITIES WAS A SEA COW WHO LIVED IN A TANK OF SALT WATER
4830-25904-0048 ITS EYES WERE LOVELY SO DARK AND SOFT AND LIQUID BUT ITS MOUTH WAS NOT PRETTY AND I DECLINED ONE OF THE DAMP KISSES WHICH IT WAS READY TO DISPENSE AT WORD OF COMMAND
4830-25904-0049 THE GREAT POLAR BEAR LIVED NEXT DOOR AND SPENT HIS TIME SPLASHING IN AND OUT OF A POOL OF WATER OR SITTING ON A BLOCK OF ICE PANTING AS IF THE MILD SPRING DAY WAS BLAZING MIDSUMMER
4853-27670-0000 I LAY FOR A LONG WHILE INSENSIBLE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE RECOVERED MY MIND INSTEAD OF DYING IN THAT SWOON I MUST EVER ACCOUNT AS THE GREATEST WONDER OF A LIFE THAT HAS NOT BEEN WANTING IN THE MARVELLOUS
4853-27670-0001 I HAD NO SOONER SAT UP THAN ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED AND MY PRESENT SITUATION INSTANTLY CAME TO ME MY HAIR WAS STIFF WITH ICE THERE WAS NO MORE FEELING IN MY HANDS THAN HAD THEY BEEN OF STONE
4853-27670-0003 IT WAS INTENSELY DARK THE BINNACLE LAMP WAS EXTINGUISHED AND THE LIGHT IN THE CABIN BURNED TOO DIMLY TO THROW THE FAINTEST COLOUR UPON THE HATCHWAY ONE THING I QUICKLY NOTICED THAT THE GALE HAD BROKEN AND BLEW NO MORE THAN A FRESH BREEZE
4853-27670-0004 THERE WAS LESS SPITE IN ITS WASH LESS FURY IN ITS BLOW THE MULTITUDINOUS ROARING OF THE HEAVING BLACKNESS HAD SOBERED INTO A HARD AND SULLEN GROWLING A SOUND AS OF THUNDER AMONG MOUNTAINS HEARD IN A VALLEY
4853-27670-0006 IT WAS WONDERFUL HOWEVER THAT SHE SHOULD STILL BE AFLOAT NO MAN COULD HAVE HEARD THE RENDING AND GRATING OF HER SIDE AGAINST THE ICE WITHOUT SUPPOSING THAT EVERY PLANK IN IT WAS BEING TORN OUT
4853-27670-0007 FINDING THAT I HAD THE USE OF MY VOICE I HOLLOAED AS LOUDLY AS I COULD BUT NO HUMAN NOTE RESPONDED THREE OR FOUR TIMES I SHOUTED GIVING SOME OF THE PEOPLE THEIR NAMES BUT IN VAIN FATHER OF MERCY I THOUGHT
4853-27670-0009 MY LONELINESS WAS MORE TERRIBLE TO ME THAN ANY OTHER CONDITION OF MY SITUATION IT WAS DREADFUL TO BE STANDING NEARLY DEAD WITH COLD IN UTTER DARKNESS
4853-27670-0010 IT WAS DREADFUL I SAY TO BE THUS PLACED AND TO FEEL THAT I WAS IN THE HEART OF THE RUDEST MOST DESOLATE SPACE OF SEA IN THE WORLD INTO WHICH THE COMMERCE OF THE EARTH DISPATCHED BUT FEW SHIPS ALL THE YEAR ROUND
4853-27670-0012 EVEN ONE ONLY TO MAKE ME AN ECHO FOR MINE OWN SPEECH NAY GOD HIMSELF THE MERCIFUL FATHER OF ALL EVEN HE SEEMED NOT THE BLACKNESS LAY LIKE A PALL UPON THE DEEP AND UPON MY SOUL
4853-27670-0013 MISERY AND HORROR WERE WITHIN THAT SHADOW AND BEYOND IT NOTHING THAT MY SPIRIT COULD LOOK UP TO I STOOD FOR SOME MOMENTS AS ONE STUNNED AND THEN MY MANHOOD TRAINED TO SOME PURPOSE BY THE USAGE OF THE SEA
4853-27670-0015 HER CASE MIGHT NOT BE SO DESPERATE AS WAS THREATENED BY THE WAY IN WHICH SHE HAD BEEN TORN AND PRECIPITATED PAST THE ICEBERG AT MOMENTS WHEN SHE PLUNGED THE WHITENESS OF THE WATER CREAMING UPON THE SURGES ON EITHER HAND
4853-27670-0016 BY PREVENTING THE SEAS WHICH WASHED ON TO THE FORECASTLE FROM CASCADING WITH THEIR FORMER VIOLENCE AFT ALSO THAT THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE MAIN AND TOP MASTS LAY UPON THE LARBOARD RAIL AND OVER THE SIDE
4853-27670-0018 I TOOK DOWN THE LAMP TRIMMED IT AND WENT TO THE LAZARETTE HATCH AT THE AFTER END OF THE CABIN HERE WERE KEPT THE STORES FOR THE CREW
4853-27670-0019 I SWALLOWED HALF A PANNIKIN OF THE HOLLANDS FOR THE SAKE OF THE WARMTH AND LIFE OF THE DRAUGHT AND ENTERING MY CABIN PUT ON THICK DRY STOCKINGS FIRST CHAFING MY FEET TILL I FELT THE BLOOD IN THEM
4853-27670-0021 I TOOK FROM THE CAPTAIN'S CABIN A STOUT CLOAK AND THREW IT OVER ME ENVELOPING MY HEAD WHICH I HAD CASED IN A WARM FUR CAP WITH THE HOOD OF IT AND THUS EQUIPPED I LIGHTED A SMALL HAND LANTERN THAT WAS USED ON DARK NIGHTS FOR HEAVING THE LOG
4853-27670-0022 NEVERTHELESS ITS RAYS SUFFERED ME TO GUESS AT THE PICTURE OF RUIN THE DECKS OFFERED THE MAIN MAST WAS SNAPPED THREE OR FOUR FEET ABOVE THE DECK AND THE STUMP OF IT SHOWED AS JAGGED AND BARBED AS A WILD BEAST'S TEETH
4853-27670-0024 I MOVED WITH EXTREME CAUTION CASTING THE LANTERN LIGHT BEFORE ME SOMETIMES STARTING AT A SOUND THAT RESEMBLED A GROAN THEN STOPPING TO STEADY MYSELF DURING SOME PARTICULAR WILD LEAP OF THE HULL
4853-27670-0025 UNTIL COMING ABREAST OF THE MAIN HATCH THE RAYS OF THE LANTERN STRUCK UPON A MAN'S BODY WHICH ON MY BRINGING THE FLAME TO HIS FACE PROVED TO BE CAPTAIN ROSY THERE WAS A WOUND OVER HIS RIGHT BROW
4853-27670-0027 THAT NO EXECUTIONER COULD HAVE GONE MORE ARTISTICALLY TO WORK TO PINION AND CHOKE A MAN UNDER A MASS OF RIGGING IN THE LARBOARD SCUPPERS LAY TWO BODIES AS I COULD JUST FAINTLY DISCERN
4853-27670-0028 FOR THEY LAY UNDER A WHOLE BODY OF SHROUDS COMPLICATED BY A MASS OF OTHER GEAR AGAINST WHICH LEANED A PORTION OF THE CABOOSE I VIEWED THEM LONG ENOUGH TO SATISFY MY MIND THAT THEY WERE DEAD AND THEN WITH A HEART OF LEAD TURNED AWAY
4853-27670-0030 NO LANGUAGE THAT I HAVE COMMAND OF COULD PUT BEFORE YOU THE HORROR THAT POSSESSED ME AS I SAT MEDITATING UPON MY SITUATION AND RECALLING THE FACES OF THE DEAD THE WIND WAS RAPIDLY FALLING AND WITH IT THE SEA
4853-27670-0031 BUT THE MOTION OF THE BRIG CONTINUED VERY HEAVY A LARGE SWELL HAVING BEEN SET RUNNING BY THE LONG FIERCE GALE THAT WAS GONE AND THERE BEING NO UPROAR OF TEMPEST IN THE SKY TO CONFOUND THE SENSES
4853-27670-0033 NEVERTHELESS HER CONTINUING TO FLOAT IN HER MISERABLY TORN AND MANGLED CONDITION WAS SO GREAT A MIRACLE THAT SPITE OF MY POOR SHIPMATES HAVING PERISHED AND MY OWN STATE BEING AS HOPELESS AS THE SKY WAS STARLESS
4853-27670-0034 TO JUDGE BY THE SOUND OF THE QUANTITY OF WATER IN THE VESSEL THAT SHE WAS FILLING I KNEW WELL YET NOT LEAKING SO RAPIDLY BUT THAT HAD OUR CREW BEEN PRESERVED WE MIGHT EASILY HAVE KEPT HER FREE
4853-27670-0036 AND EVEN HAD I MANAGED THIS SHE STOOD TO BE SWAMPED AND I TO BE DROWNED
4853-27671-0000 THERE WERE A FEW STARS DYING OUT IN THE DARK WEST THE ATMOSPHERE WAS CLEAR AND WHEN THE SUN ROSE I KNEW HE WOULD TURN THE SABLE PALL OVERHEAD INTO BLUENESS THE HULL LAY VERY DEEP
4853-27671-0002 AND A DEEP OF ROLLING SAPPHIRE I STARTED WITH SUDDEN TERROR TO OBSERVE HOW CLOSE THE COVERING BOARD SAT UPON THE WATER AND HOW THE HEAD OF EVERY SWELL RAN PAST AS HIGH AS THE BULWARK RAIL
4853-27671-0003 YET FOR A FEW MOMENTS I STOOD CONTEMPLATING THE SCENE OF RUIN IT WAS VISIBLE NOW TO ITS MOST TRIFLING DETAIL THE FOREMAST WAS GONE SMOOTH OFF AT THE DECK IT LAY OVER THE STARBOARD BOW
4853-27671-0005 HAD FLOATED THE JOLLY BOAT OUT OF THE LONG BOAT AND SWEPT IT BOTTOM UP TO THE GANGWAY WHERE IT LAY AS THOUGH GOD'S MERCY DESIGNED IT SHOULD BE PRESERVED FOR MY USE FOR NOT LONG AFTER IT HAD BEEN FLOATED OUT THE BRIG STRUCK THE BERG THE MASTS FELL
4853-27671-0006 AND THERE LAY THE LONG BOAT CRUSHED INTO STAVES THIS SIGNAL AND SURPRISING INTERVENTION FILLED MY HEART WITH THANKFULNESS THOUGH MY SPIRITS SANK AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF MY POOR DROWNED SHIPMATES
4853-27671-0008 WHEN SHE SHOULD BE LAUNCHED AND LYING ALONGSIDE RAN HER MIDWAY OUT BY THE TACKLE AND ATTACHING A LINE TO A RING BOLT IN HER BOW SHOVED HER OVER THE SIDE AND SHE FELL WITH A SPLASH SHIPPING SCARCE A HATFUL OF WATER
4853-27671-0009 BUT I MET WITH AN OAR THAT HAD BELONGED TO THE OTHER BOAT AND THIS WITH THE MAST AND SAIL I DROPPED INTO HER THE SWELL LIFTING HER UP TO MY HAND WHEN THE BLUE FOLD SWUNG PAST MY NEXT BUSINESS WAS TO VICTUAL HER
4853-27671-0011 EIGHT OR TEN BISCUITS SOME CANDLES A TINDER BOX SEVERAL LEMONS A LITTLE BAG OF FLOWER AND THIRTEEN BOTTLES OF BEER THESE THINGS I ROLLED UP IN A CLOTH AND PLACED THEM IN THE BOAT
4853-27671-0012 THE HEAVY SLUGGISH SODDEN MOVEMENT OF THE HULL ADVISED ME TO MAKE HASTE SHE WAS NOW BARELY LIFTING TO THE SWELL THAT CAME BRIMMING IN BROAD LIQUID BLUE BROWS TO HER STEM
4853-27671-0014 WHEN A SORT OF STAGGERING SENSATION IN THE UPWARD SLIDE OF THE HULL GAVE ME A FRIGHT AND WATCHING MY CHANCE I JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND CAST THE LINE THAT HELD HER ADRIFT THE SUN WAS AN HOUR ABOVE THE HORIZON
4853-27671-0015 HEAVING VERY SLOWLY THOUGH YOU FELT THE WEIGHT OF THE MIGHTY OCEAN IN EVERY FOLD AND EASTWARDS THE SHOULDERS OF THE SWELL CATCHING THE GLORIOUS REFLECTION OF THE SUN HURLED THE SPLENDOUR ALONG
4853-27671-0017 SHOT WITH PEARLY LUSTRE FLOATED OVERHEAD VERY HIGH IT WAS IN TRUTH A FAIR AND PLEASANT MORNING OF AN ICY COLDNESS INDEED BUT THE AIR BEING DRY ITS SHREWDNESS WAS ENDURABLE
4853-27671-0018 WITH US HAD IT DAWNED YESTERDAY INSTEAD OF TO DAY MY COMPANIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALIVE AND YONDER SINKING RUINED FABRIC A TRIM SHIP CAPABLE OF BEARING US STOUTLY INTO WARM SEAS AND TO OUR HOMES AT LAST
4853-27671-0020 INTO THOSE PRODIGIOUS LEAGUES OF OCEAN WHICH LAY STRETCHED UNDER THE SKY WHILST THE HULL FLOATED SHE WAS SOMETHING TO HOLD ON TO SO TO SAY SOMETHING FOR THE EYE AMID THE VASTNESS OF WATER TO REST UPON
4853-27671-0021 AND HER MAIN DECK BLEW UP WITH A LOUD CLAP OR BLAST OF NOISE I COULD FOLLOW THE LINE OF HER BULWARKS FLUCTUATING AND WAVING IN THE CLEAR DARK BLUE WHEN SHE WAS SOME FEET UNDER
4853-27671-0023 IT WAS THE SAILOR THAT HAD LAIN DROWNED ON THE STARBOARD SIDE OF THE FORWARD DECK BEING FROZEN STIFF HE ROSE IN THE POSTURE IN WHICH HE HAD EXPIRED THAT IS WITH HIS ARMS EXTENDED
4853-27671-0024 SO THAT WHEN HE JUMPED TO THE SURFACE HE CAME WITH HIS HANDS LIFTED UP TO HEAVEN AND THUS HE STAYED A MINUTE SUSTAINED BY THE EDDIES WHICH ALSO REVOLVED HIM THE SHOCK OCCASIONED BY THIS MELANCHOLY OBJECT WAS SO GREAT
4853-27671-0026 AND HAULING THE SHEET AFT PUT THE OAR OVER THE STERN AND BROUGHT THE LITTLE CRAFT'S HEAD TO AN EASTERLY COURSE THE DRAUGHT OF AIR WAS EXTREMELY WEAK AND SCARCE FURNISHED IMPULSE ENOUGH TO THE SAIL TO RAISE A BUBBLE ALONGSIDE
4853-27671-0027 THE BOAT WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET LONG
4853-27671-0029 WHERE PERCHANCE I MIGHT MEET A WHALER OR A SOUTHSEAMAN FROM NEW HOLLAND BUT MY HEART SANK AT THE PROSPECT OF THE LEAGUES OF WATER WHICH ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND THE ISLANDS AND THE WESTERN AMERICAN SEABOARD INDEED
4853-27671-0030 I UNDERSTOOD THAT MY ONLY HOPE OF DELIVERANCE LAY IN BEING PICKED UP AND THAT THOUGH BY HEADING EAST I SHOULD BE CLINGING TO THE STORMY PARTS I WAS MORE LIKELY TO MEET WITH A SHIP HEREABOUTS
4853-27671-0032 I AM PERSUADED MY HEART MUST HAVE BROKEN AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE DIED OF GRIEF FAINTLY AS THE WIND BLEW IT SPEEDILY WAFTED ME OUT OF SIGHT OF THE FLOATING RELICS OF THE WRECK
4853-27671-0033 AND THEN ALL WAS BARE BALD SWELLING SEA AND EMPEARLED SKY DARKENING IN LAGOONS OF AZURE DOWN TO THE SOFT MOUNTAINOUS MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR LYING LIKE THE COAST OF A CONTINENT ON THE LARBOARD HORIZON
4853-27671-0035 LIFTING MY EYES WITH INVOLUNTARY SYMPATHY IN THE DIRECTION POINTED TO BY THE UPRAISED ARMS OF THE SAILOR I OBSERVED THE GREAT ROYAL BIRD HANGING LIKE A SHAPE OF MARBLE DIRECTLY OVER THE FROTHING EDDIES
4853-27671-0036 IT WAS AS THOUGH THE SPIRIT OF THE DEEP HAD TAKEN FORM IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE NOBLEST OF ALL THE FOWLS OF ITS DOMINIONS AND POISED ON TREMORLESS WINGS
4853-27671-0038 THE BIRD QUITTED THE SPOT OF THE WRECK AFTER A WHILE AND FOLLOWED ME ITS EYES HAD THE SPARKLING BLOOD RED GLEAM OF RUBIES
4853-27671-0039 IT WAS AS SILENT AS A PHANTOM AND WITH ARCHED NECK AND MOTIONLESS PLUMES SEEMED TO WATCH ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS THAT PRESENTLY GREW INSUFFERABLE SO FAR FROM FINDING ANY COMFORT OF COMPANIONSHIP IN THE CREATURE
4853-29413-0000 GLOODY SETTLES THE ACCOUNT A NIGHT OF FEVER A NIGHT WHEN I DID SLUMBER FOR A FEW MINUTES OF HORRID DREAMS THIS WAS WHAT I MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED AND THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
4853-29413-0001 THE FRESH MORNING AIR FLOWING THROUGH MY OPEN WINDOW COOLED AND COMPOSED ME THE MERCY OF SLEEP FOUND ME WHEN I WOKE AND LOOKED AT MY WATCH I WAS A NEW MAN THE HOUR WAS NOON I RANG MY BELL
4853-29413-0003 THE DELAY OF DRESSING WAS MORE THAN I HAD PATIENCE TO ENCOUNTER UNLESS I WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN HERE WAS THE VERY PERSON WHOM I WANTED TO ENLIGHTEN ME GLOODY SHOWED HIMSELF AT THE DOOR
4853-29413-0004 WITH A FACE OMINOUSLY WRETCHED AS WELL AS UGLY I INSTANTLY THOUGHT OF CRISTEL IF YOU BRING ME BAD NEWS I SAID DON'T KEEP ME WAITING FOR IT IT'S NOTHING THAT NEED TROUBLE YOU SIR
4853-29413-0006 WHAT DID HE DO FLEW INTO A FURIOUS RAGE I DON'T COMPLAIN OF THAT I DARESAY I DESERVED IT PLEASE TO EXCUSE MY GETTING UP AGAIN I CAN'T LOOK YOU IN THE FACE AND TELL YOU OF IT HE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
4853-29413-0007 EVEN A POOR DEVIL LIKE ME DOES SOMETIMES FEEL IT WHEN HE IS INSULTED MISTER ROYLAKE HE KICKED ME SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT SIR I WOULD NEVER HAVE MENTIONED IT IF I HADN'T HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO TELL YOU ONLY I DON'T KNOW HOW
4853-29413-0009 WHAT HIS MASTER HAD NO DOUBT INFERRED WAS WHAT I SAW PLAINLY TOO CRISTEL HAD SAVED MY LIFE AND HAD BEEN DIRECTED HOW TO DO IT BY THE POOR FELLOW WHO HAD SUFFERED IN MY CAUSE
4853-29413-0010 WE WILL WAIT A LITTLE BEFORE WE TALK OF SETTING THE LAW IN FORCE I SAID IN THE MEANTIME GLOODY I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT YOU WOULD TELL THE MAGISTRATE IF I CALLED YOU AS A WITNESS HE CONSIDERED A LITTLE
4853-29413-0012 THE INVESTIGATION THAT FOLLOWED WAS FAR TOO LONG AND TOO WEARISOME TO BE RELATED HERE IF I GIVE THE SUBSTANCE OF IT I SHALL HAVE DONE ENOUGH SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS AWAKE AND SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS ALONE SOMETIMES WHEN HE WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING
4853-29413-0013 THE CUR HAD BETRAYED HIMSELF IT WAS A PALTRY VENGEANCE I OWN TO GRATIFY A MALICIOUS PLEASURE AS I DID NOW IN THINKING OF HIM AND SPEAKING OF HIM BY THE DEGRADING NAME WHICH HIS MORBID HUMILITY HAD SUGGESTED
4853-29413-0015 BUT HIS RESOLUTION TO DO ME GOOD SERVICE IN RETURN FOR MY KINDNESS TO HIM FAR FROM BEING SHAKEN WAS CONFIRMED BY CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN HIS MASTER RETURNED TO THE CHEMICAL STUDIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY MENTIONED
4853-29413-0016 GLOODY WAS EMPLOYED AS ASSISTANT TO THE EXTENT OF HIS LIMITED CAPACITY FOR MAKING HIMSELF USEFUL HE HAD NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT I WAS THE OBJECT OF ANY OF THE EXPERIMENTS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE THE TEA PARTY
4853-29413-0018 THAT HE WOULD BE INSTANTLY DISMISSED IF HE MENTIONED TO ANY LIVING CREATURE WHAT HE HAD JUST SEEN BY WHAT PROCESS HE ARRIVED AT THE SUSPICION THAT MY SAFETY MIGHT BE THREATENED BY THE EXPERIMENT ON THE DOG HE WAS ENTIRELY UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
4853-29413-0019 IT WAS BORNE IN ON MY MIND SIR AND THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU HE SAID I DIDN'T DARE SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT IT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BELIEVED ME OR IF YOU DID BELIEVE ME YOU MIGHT HAVE SENT FOR THE POLICE
4853-29413-0021 THAT SHE WAS TRUE AS STEEL AND NOT EASILY FRIGHTENED I DIDN'T NEED TO GUESS I KNEW IT GLOODY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO PREPARE CRISTEL FOR THE TERRIBLE CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAD DETERMINED TO REPOSE IN HER AND HAD NOT SUCCEEDED
4853-29413-0022 SHE WAS PLEDGED TO SECRECY UNDER PENALTY OF RUINING THE MAN WHO WAS TRYING TO SAVE ME AND TO HER PRESENCE OF MIND WAS TRUSTED THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESERVING MY LIFE WHAT A SITUATION FOR A GIRL OF EIGHTEEN
4853-29413-0024 HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT HE WOULD NOT DRINK THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE JUG YOU FORGET SIR THAT I HAD SEEN THE DOG REVIVED BY TWO DOSES GIVEN WITH A SPACE OF TIME BETWEEN THEM
4853-29413-0025 I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THIS AFTER WHAT HE HAD ALREADY TOLD ME MY INTELLIGENCE BRIGHTENED A LITTLE AS I WENT ON AND YOUR ACCIDENT IN THE NEXT ROOM WAS PLANNED OF COURSE I SAID
4853-29413-0027 A MAN WHO CAN CHANGE HIS COMPLEXION AT WILL IS A MAN WE HAV'N'T HEARD OF YET MISTER ROYLAKE I HAD BEEN DRESSING FOR SOME TIME PAST LONGING TO SEE CRISTEL IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY
4853-29413-0028 IS THERE ANYTHING MORE I ASKED THAT I OUGHT TO KNOW ONLY ONE THING MISTER ROYLAKE THAT I CAN THINK OF GLOODY REPLIED I'M AFRAID IT'S MISS CRISTEL'S TURN NEXT WHAT DO YOU MEAN
4853-29413-0030 I WAS DRESSED BY THIS TIME AND SO EAGER TO GET TO THE COTTAGE THAT I HAD ALREADY OPENED MY DOOR WHAT I HAD JUST HEARD BROUGHT ME BACK INTO THE ROOM AS A MATTER OF COURSE WE BOTH SUSPECTED THE SAME PERSON OF STEALING THE OARS
4853-29413-0031 HAD WE ANY PROOF TO JUSTIFY US GLOODY AT ONCE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WE HAD NO PROOF I HAPPENED TO LOOK AT THE BOAT HE SAID AND I MISSED THE OARS OH YES I SEARCHED THE BOAT HOUSE NO OARS NO OARS
4859-22176-0000 AT THE END OF JANUARY PIERRE WENT TO MOSCOW AND STAYED IN AN ANNEX OF HIS HOUSE WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED HE CALLED ON COUNT ROSTOPCHIN AND ON SOME ACQUAINTANCES WHO WERE BACK IN MOSCOW AND HE INTENDED TO LEAVE FOR PETERSBURG TWO DAYS LATER
4859-22176-0001 EVERYBODY WAS CELEBRATING THE VICTORY EVERYTHING WAS BUBBLING WITH LIFE IN THE RUINED BUT REVIVING CITY EVERYONE WAS PLEASED TO SEE PIERRE EVERYONE WISHED TO MEET HIM AND EVERYONE QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN PIERRE FELT PARTICULARLY WELL DISPOSED TOWARD THEM ALL
4859-22176-0003 AND WOULD HE MIND TAKING A PARCEL FOR SOMEONE HE REPLIED YES PERHAPS OR I THINK SO AND SO ON HE HAD HEARD THAT THE ROSTOVS WERE AT KOSTROMA BUT THE THOUGHT OF NATASHA SELDOM OCCURRED TO HIM
4859-22176-0004 IF IT DID IT WAS ONLY AS A PLEASANT MEMORY OF THE DISTANT PAST HE FELT HIMSELF NOT ONLY FREE FROM SOCIAL OBLIGATIONS BUT ALSO FROM THAT FEELING WHICH IT SEEMED TO HIM HE HAD AROUSED IN HIMSELF ON THE THIRD DAY AFTER HIS ARRIVAL HE HEARD FROM THE DRUBETSKOYS
4859-22176-0006 WHICH HAD NOT BEEN BURNED IN VOZDVIZHENKA STREET HE DROVE THAT SAME EVENING TO SEE HER ON HIS WAY TO THE HOUSE PIERRE KEPT THINKING OF PRINCE ANDREW OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP OF HIS VARIOUS MEETINGS WITH HIM AND ESPECIALLY OF THE LAST ONE AT BORODINO
4859-22176-0007 IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE DIED IN THE BITTER FRAME OF MIND HE WAS THEN IN IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE MEANING OF LIFE WAS NOT DISCLOSED TO HIM BEFORE HE DIED THOUGHT PIERRE HE RECALLED KARATAEV AND HIS DEATH AND INVOLUNTARILY BEGAN TO COMPARE THESE TWO MEN SO DIFFERENT
4859-22176-0009 WHO MET PIERRE WITH A STERN FACE AS IF WISHING TO MAKE THE VISITOR FEEL THAT THE ABSENCE OF THE OLD PRINCE HAD NOT DISTURBED THE ORDER OF THINGS IN THE HOUSE INFORMED HIM THAT THE PRINCESS HAD GONE TO HER OWN APARTMENTS AND THAT SHE RECEIVED ON SUNDAYS ANNOUNCE ME PERHAPS SHE WILL SEE ME SAID PIERRE
4859-22176-0010 YES SIR SAID THE MAN PLEASE STEP INTO THE PORTRAIT GALLERY A FEW MINUTES LATER THE FOOTMAN RETURNED
4859-22176-0012 GLANCING AT THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS THE PRINCESS ROSE QUICKLY TO MEET HIM AND HELD OUT HER HAND YES SHE SAID LOOKING AT HIS ALTERED FACE AFTER HE HAD KISSED HER HAND SO THIS IS HOW WE MEET AGAIN
4859-22176-0013 HE SPOKE OF YOU EVEN AT THE VERY LAST SHE WENT ON TURNING HER EYES FROM PIERRE TO HER COMPANION WITH A SHYNESS THAT SURPRISED HIM FOR AN INSTANT I WAS SO GLAD TO HEAR OF YOUR SAFETY IT WAS THE FIRST PIECE OF GOOD NEWS WE HAD RECEIVED FOR A LONG TIME
4859-22176-0015 AND AS OFTEN HAPPENS WHEN ONE IS TALKING FELT SOMEHOW THAT THIS COMPANION IN THE BLACK DRESS WAS A GOOD KIND EXCELLENT CREATURE WHO WOULD NOT HINDER HIS CONVERSING FREELY WITH PRINCESS MARY BUT WHEN HE MENTIONED THE ROSTOVS PRINCESS MARY'S FACE EXPRESSED STILL GREATER EMBARRASSMENT
4859-22176-0016 SHE AGAIN GLANCED RAPIDLY FROM PIERRE'S FACE TO THAT OF THE LADY IN THE BLACK DRESS AND SAID DO YOU REALLY NOT RECOGNIZE HER PIERRE LOOKED AGAIN AT THE COMPANION'S PALE DELICATE FACE WITH ITS BLACK EYES AND PECULIAR MOUTH AND SOMETHING NEAR TO HIM LONG FORGOTTEN AND MORE THAN SWEET
4859-22176-0018 AND WITH DIFFICULTY EFFORT AND STRESS LIKE THE OPENING OF A DOOR GROWN RUSTY ON ITS HINGES A SMILE APPEARED ON THE FACE WITH THE ATTENTIVE EYES AND FROM THAT OPENING DOOR CAME A BREATH OF FRAGRANCE WHICH SUFFUSED PIERRE WITH A HAPPINESS HE HAD LONG FORGOTTEN
4859-22176-0019 AND OF WHICH HE HAD NOT EVEN BEEN THINKING ESPECIALLY AT THAT MOMENT IT SUFFUSED HIM SEIZED HIM AND ENVELOPED HIM COMPLETELY WHEN SHE SMILED DOUBT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IT WAS NATASHA AND HE LOVED HER
4859-22176-0021 CLEARER THAN ANY WORDS COULD HAVE DONE DID HE BETRAY TO HIMSELF TO HER AND TO PRINCESS MARY THAT HE LOVED HER NO IT'S ONLY THE UNEXPECTEDNESS OF IT THOUGHT PIERRE BUT AS SOON AS HE TRIED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION HE HAD BEGUN WITH PRINCESS MARY HE AGAIN GLANCED AT NATASHA
4859-22176-0022 HE BECAME CONFUSED IN HIS SPEECH AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT HE WAS SAYING
4859-22176-0024 BECAUSE ON THAT FACE WHOSE EYES HAD ALWAYS SHONE WITH A SUPPRESSED SMILE OF THE JOY OF LIFE NOW WHEN HE FIRST ENTERED AND GLANCED AT HER THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST SHADOW OF A SMILE ONLY HER EYES WERE KINDLY ATTENTIVE AND SADLY INTERROGATIVE
4859-26870-0000 AT FIRST HE SAW NOTHING REPREHENSIBLE IN THIS BUT IN THE SECOND YEAR OF HIS MARRIAGE HIS VIEW OF THAT FORM OF PUNISHMENT SUDDENLY CHANGED ONCE IN SUMMER HE HAD SENT FOR THE VILLAGE ELDER FROM BOGUCHAROVO
4859-26870-0002 ON RETURNING TO LUNCH NICHOLAS WENT UP TO HIS WIFE WHO SAT WITH HER HEAD BENT LOW OVER HER EMBROIDERY FRAME AND AS USUAL BEGAN TO TELL HER WHAT HE HAD BEEN DOING THAT MORNING AMONG OTHER THINGS HE SPOKE OF THE BOGUCHAROVO ELDER COUNTESS MARY TURNED RED AND THEN PALE
4859-26870-0003 SUCH AN INSOLENT SCOUNDREL HE CRIED GROWING HOT AGAIN AT THE MERE RECOLLECTION OF HIM IF HE HAD TOLD ME HE WAS DRUNK AND DID NOT SEE BUT WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU MARY HE SUDDENLY ASKED
4859-26870-0005 THE MOMENT NICHOLAS TOOK HER HAND SHE COULD NO LONGER RESTRAIN HERSELF AND BEGAN TO CRY NICHOLAS I SAW IT HE WAS TO BLAME BUT WHY DO YOU NICHOLAS AND SHE COVERED HER FACE WITH HER HANDS NICHOLAS SAID NOTHING HE FLUSHED CRIMSON LEFT HER SIDE AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM
4859-26870-0006 HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT SHE WAS WEEPING ABOUT BUT COULD NOT IN HIS HEART AT ONCE AGREE WITH HER THAT WHAT HE HAD REGARDED FROM CHILDHOOD AS QUITE AN EVERYDAY EVENT WAS WRONG IS IT JUST SENTIMENTALITY OLD WIVES TALES OR IS SHE RIGHT HE ASKED HIMSELF
4859-26870-0008 SHE TOOK HIS HAND AND KISSED IT NICHOLAS WHEN DID YOU BREAK YOUR CAMEO SHE ASKED TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT LOOKING AT HIS FINGER ON WHICH HE WORE A RING WITH A CAMEO OF LAOCOON'S HEAD TODAY IT WAS THE SAME AFFAIR OH MARY DON'T REMIND ME OF IT AND AGAIN HE FLUSHED
4859-26870-0009 I GIVE YOU MY WORD OF HONOR IT SHAN'T OCCUR AGAIN AND LET THIS ALWAYS BE A REMINDER TO ME AND HE POINTED TO THE BROKEN RING AFTER THAT WHEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HIS VILLAGE ELDERS OR STEWARDS THE BLOOD RUSHED TO HIS FACE AND HIS FISTS BEGAN TO CLENCH
4859-26870-0011 MARY YOU MUST DESPISE ME HE WOULD SAY I DESERVE IT YOU SHOULD GO GO AWAY AT ONCE IF YOU DON'T FEEL STRONG ENOUGH TO CONTROL YOURSELF SHE WOULD REPLY SADLY TRYING TO COMFORT HER HUSBAND AMONG THE GENTRY OF THE PROVINCE NICHOLAS WAS RESPECTED BUT NOT LIKED
4859-26870-0012 HE DID NOT CONCERN HIMSELF WITH THE INTERESTS OF HIS OWN CLASS AND CONSEQUENTLY SOME THOUGHT HIM PROUD AND OTHERS THOUGHT HIM STUPID THE WHOLE SUMMER FROM SPRING SOWING TO HARVEST HE WAS BUSY WITH THE WORK ON HIS FARM IN AUTUMN HE GAVE HIMSELF UP TO HUNTING WITH THE SAME BUSINESS LIKE SERIOUSNESS
4859-26870-0014 READING A TASK HE FIRST IMPOSED UPON HIMSELF AS A DUTY BUT WHICH AFTERWARDS BECAME A HABIT AFFORDING HIM A SPECIAL KIND OF PLEASURE AND A CONSCIOUSNESS OF BEING OCCUPIED WITH SERIOUS MATTERS
4859-26870-0015 IN WINTER EXCEPT FOR BUSINESS EXCURSIONS HE SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME AT HOME MAKING HIMSELF ONE WITH HIS FAMILY AND ENTERING INTO ALL THE DETAILS OF HIS CHILDREN'S RELATIONS WITH THEIR MOTHER THE HARMONY BETWEEN HIM AND HIS WIFE GREW CLOSER AND CLOSER
4859-26870-0017 HE HAD ASKED PRINCESS MARY TO BE GENTLE AND KIND TO HIS COUSIN SHE THOROUGHLY REALIZED THE WRONG HE HAD DONE SONYA FELT HERSELF TO BLAME TOWARD HER AND IMAGINED THAT HER WEALTH HAD INFLUENCED NICHOLAS CHOICE
4859-26870-0018 BUT OFTEN FELT ILL WILL TOWARD HER WHICH SHE COULD NOT OVERCOME ONCE SHE HAD A TALK WITH HER FRIEND NATASHA ABOUT SONYA AND ABOUT HER OWN INJUSTICE TOWARD HER YOU KNOW SAID NATASHA YOU HAVE READ THE GOSPELS A GREAT DEAL THERE IS A PASSAGE IN THEM THAT JUST FITS SONYA WHAT ASKED COUNTESS MARY SURPRISED
4859-26870-0020 SHE IS A STERILE FLOWER YOU KNOW LIKE SOME STRAWBERRY BLOSSOMS
4859-26870-0021 THOUGH COUNTESS MARY TOLD NATASHA THAT THOSE WORDS IN THE GOSPEL MUST BE UNDERSTOOD DIFFERENTLY YET LOOKING AT SONYA SHE AGREED WITH NATASHA'S EXPLANATION
4859-26870-0023 SHE WAITED ON THE OLD COUNTESS PETTED AND SPOILED THE CHILDREN WAS ALWAYS READY TO RENDER THE SMALL SERVICES FOR WHICH SHE HAD A GIFT AND ALL THIS WAS UNCONSCIOUSLY ACCEPTED FROM HER WITH INSUFFICIENT GRATITUDE THE COUNTRY SEAT AT BALD HILLS HAD BEEN REBUILT THOUGH NOT ON THE SAME SCALE AS UNDER THE OLD PRINCE
4859-26870-0024 THE BUILDINGS BEGUN UNDER STRAITENED CIRCUMSTANCES WERE MORE THAN SIMPLE THE IMMENSE HOUSE ON THE OLD STONE FOUNDATIONS WAS OF WOOD PLASTERED ONLY INSIDE IT HAD BARE DEAL FLOORS AND WAS FURNISHED WITH VERY SIMPLE HARD SOFAS ARMCHAIRS TABLES AND CHAIRS
4859-29340-0000 WHAT FORCE MOVES THE NATIONS BIOGRAPHICAL HISTORIANS AND HISTORIANS OF SEPARATE NATIONS UNDERSTAND THIS FORCE AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS IN THEIR NARRATION EVENTS OCCUR SOLELY BY THE WILL OF A NAPOLEON AND ALEXANDER
4859-29340-0001 OR IN GENERAL OF THE PERSONS THEY DESCRIBE THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THIS KIND OF HISTORIAN TO THE QUESTION OF WHAT FORCE CAUSES EVENTS TO HAPPEN ARE SATISFACTORY ONLY AS LONG AS THERE IS BUT ONE HISTORIAN TO EACH EVENT
4859-29340-0003 ONE HISTORIAN SAYS THAT AN EVENT WAS PRODUCED BY NAPOLEON'S POWER ANOTHER THAT IT WAS PRODUCED BY ALEXANDER'S
4859-29340-0004 BESIDES THIS HISTORIANS OF THAT KIND CONTRADICT EACH OTHER EVEN IN THEIR STATEMENT AS TO THE FORCE ON WHICH THE AUTHORITY OF SOME PARTICULAR PERSON WAS BASED THIERS A BONAPARTIST SAYS THAT NAPOLEON'S POWER WAS BASED ON HIS VIRTUE AND GENIUS
4859-29340-0006 AND FURNISH NO REPLY TO HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION WRITERS OF UNIVERSAL HISTORY WHO DEAL WITH ALL THE NATIONS SEEM TO RECOGNIZE HOW ERRONEOUS IS THE SPECIALIST HISTORIANS VIEW OF THE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0007 THEY DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT AS A POWER INHERENT IN HEROES AND RULERS BUT AS THE RESULTANT OF A MULTIPLICITY OF VARIOUSLY DIRECTED FORCES IN DESCRIBING A WAR OR THE SUBJUGATION OF A PEOPLE A GENERAL HISTORIAN LOOKS FOR THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT
4859-29340-0009 BE REGARDED AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS YET IN MOST CASES UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS STILL EMPLOY THE CONCEPTION OF POWER AS A FORCE THAT ITSELF PRODUCES EVENTS AND TREAT IT AS THEIR CAUSE
4859-29340-0010 IN THEIR EXPOSITION AN HISTORIC CHARACTER IS FIRST THE PRODUCT OF HIS TIME AND HIS POWER ONLY THE RESULTANT OF VARIOUS FORCES AND THEN HIS POWER IS ITSELF A FORCE PRODUCING EVENTS GERVINUS SCHLOSSER AND OTHERS FOR INSTANCE
4859-29340-0012 AND THAT THE VERY IDEAS OF SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE WERE ARRESTED IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT BY NAPOLEON'S CAPRICE THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE PRODUCED NAPOLEON'S POWER BUT NAPOLEON'S POWER SUPPRESSED THE IDEAS OF THE REVOLUTION
4859-29340-0013 AND THE GENERAL TEMPER OF THE AGE THIS CURIOUS CONTRADICTION IS NOT ACCIDENTAL NOT ONLY DOES IT OCCUR AT EVERY STEP BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ACCOUNTS ARE ALL MADE UP OF A CHAIN OF SUCH CONTRADICTIONS
4859-29340-0015 AND SO TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTANT FORCES THEY ARE OBLIGED TO ADMIT IN ADDITION TO THE INSUFFICIENT COMPONENTS ANOTHER UNEXPLAINED FORCE AFFECTING THE RESULTANT ACTION
4859-29340-0016 SPECIALIST HISTORIANS DESCRIBING THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN THIRTEEN OR THE RESTORATION OF THE BOURBONS PLAINLY ASSERT THAT THESE EVENTS WERE PRODUCED BY THE WILL OF ALEXANDER BUT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIAN GERVINUS REFUTING THIS OPINION OF THE SPECIALIST HISTORIAN
4859-29340-0018 FICHTE CHATEAUBRIAND AND OTHERS THE HISTORIAN EVIDENTLY DECOMPOSES ALEXANDER'S POWER INTO THE COMPONENTS TALLEYRAND CHATEAUBRIAND AND THE REST BUT THE SUM OF THE COMPONENTS THAT IS THE INTERACTIONS OF CHATEAUBRIAND
4859-29340-0019 TALLEYRAND MADAME DE STAEL AND THE OTHERS EVIDENTLY DOES NOT EQUAL THE RESULTANT NAMELY THE PHENOMENON OF MILLIONS OF FRENCHMEN SUBMITTING TO THE BOURBONS THAT CHATEAUBRIAND MADAME DE STAEL
4859-29340-0021 THE HISTORIAN IS AGAIN OBLIGED TO FALL BACK ON POWER THE FORCE HE HAD DENIED AND TO RECOGNIZE IT AS THE RESULTANT OF THE FORCES THAT IS HE HAS TO ADMIT AN UNEXPLAINED FORCE ACTING ON THE RESULTANT
4859-29340-0022 AND THAT IS JUST WHAT THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS DO AND CONSEQUENTLY
4859-29340-0024 AND IN THE SAME WAY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS SOMETIMES WHEN IT PLEASES THEM AND FITS IN WITH THEIR THEORY SAY THAT POWER IS THE RESULT OF EVENTS AND SOMETIMES WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVE SOMETHING ELSE SAY THAT POWER PRODUCES EVENTS
4859-29340-0025 A THIRD CLASS OF HISTORIANS THE SO CALLED HISTORIANS OF CULTURE FOLLOWING THE PATH LAID DOWN BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS WHO SOMETIMES ACCEPT WRITERS AND LADIES AS FORCES PRODUCING EVENTS AGAIN TAKE THAT FORCE TO BE SOMETHING QUITE DIFFERENT
4859-29340-0027 WHY NOT EXPLAIN THEM BY THE FACT THAT SUCH AND SUCH PEOPLE WROTE SUCH AND SUCH BOOKS OF THE IMMENSE NUMBER OF INDICATIONS ACCOMPANYING EVERY VITAL PHENOMENON THESE HISTORIANS SELECT THE INDICATION OF INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND SAY THAT THIS INDICATION IS THE CAUSE
4859-29340-0028 ONLY BY A GREAT STRETCH CAN ONE ADMIT THAT THERE IS ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY AND THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLES AND IN NO CASE CAN ONE ADMIT THAT INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY CONTROLS PEOPLE'S ACTIONS
4859-29340-0030 ALL THE CUNNINGLY DEVISED ARGUMENTS WITH WHICH THESE HISTORIES ARE FILLED ADMITTING THAT NATIONS ARE GOVERNED BY SOME UNDEFINED FORCE CALLED AN IDEA HISTORY'S ESSENTIAL QUESTION STILL REMAINS UNANSWERED
4859-29340-0031 AND TO THE FORMER POWER OF MONARCHS AND TO THE INFLUENCE OF ADVISERS AND OTHER PEOPLE INTRODUCED BY THE UNIVERSAL HISTORIANS ANOTHER NEWER FORCE THE IDEA IS ADDED THE CONNECTION OF WHICH WITH THE MASSES NEEDS EXPLANATION
4859-29340-0033 HAD THE EFFECT OF MAKING FRENCHMEN BEGIN TO DROWN ONE ANOTHER CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD WITHOUT AN EXPLANATION OF THE CAUSAL NEXUS OF THIS NEW FORCE WITH THE EVENT UNDOUBTEDLY SOME RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN ALL WHO LIVE CONTEMPORANEOUSLY
4859-29340-0034 JUST AS SUCH A CONNECTION MAY BE FOUND BETWEEN THE MOVEMENTS OF HUMANITY AND COMMERCE HANDICRAFT GARDENING OR ANYTHING ELSE YOU PLEASE
4859-29340-0036 TO TRADERS AGRICULTURISTS AND SOLDIERS IF THEY DO NOT EXPRESS IT THAT IS MERELY BECAUSE TRADERS AND SOLDIERS DO NOT WRITE HISTORY AND TWO THAT SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY ENLIGHTENMENT CIVILIZATION CULTURE IDEAS ARE ALL INDISTINCT
4859-29340-0037 INDEFINITE CONCEPTIONS UNDER WHOSE BANNER IT IS VERY EASY TO USE WORDS HAVING A STILL LESS DEFINITE MEANING AND WHICH CAN THEREFORE BE READILY INTRODUCED INTO ANY THEORY BUT NOT TO SPEAK OF THE INTRINSIC QUALITY OF HISTORIES OF THIS KIND
4859-29340-0039 ARE SIGNIFICANT FROM THE FACT THAT AFTER SERIOUSLY AND MINUTELY EXAMINING
4859-29340-0040 AS SOON AS THEY HAVE TO DESCRIBE AN ACTUAL HISTORIC EVENT SUCH AS THE CAMPAIGN OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE FOR INSTANCE THEY INVOLUNTARILY DESCRIBE IT AS RESULTING FROM AN EXERCISE OF POWER AND SAY PLAINLY THAT THAT WAS THE RESULT OF NAPOLEON'S WILL SPEAKING SO
4898-20016-0000 HASTENING TO BEGIN HIS WORK THE TOWN IS AN OLD FASHIONED ONE AND ALTHOUGH THE OBSERVANCE OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH FESTIVAL IS NO LONGER FROWNED UPON AS IN YEARS PAST YET IT HAS BEEN LITTLE REGARDED
4898-20016-0001 ESPECIALLY IN THE CHURCH OF WHICH NATHAN IS A MEMBER AS THE SADDLER MOUNTED THE STEPS OF HIS SHOP HE FELT THE BLOOD SO RUSH ALONG HIS LIMBS AND TINGLE IN HIS FINGERS
4898-20016-0003 WHICH NATHAN ATTENDS STANDS IN THE SAME SQUARE WITH HIS SHOP AND NEARLY OPPOSITE IT WAS CLOSED AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS DAY AND A RECENT SNOW HAD HEAPED THE STEPS AND ROOF AND LOADED THE WINDOWS
4898-20016-0004 NATHAN THOUGHT THAT IT LOOKED UNCOMMONLY BEAUTIFUL IN THE SOFTENING TWILIGHT OF THE MORNING WHILE NATHAN STOOD MUSING WITH HIS EYES FIXED UPON THE CHURCH
4898-20016-0006 AS TO WHO THE STRANGER COULD BE WHEN HE BEHELD HIM TURN IN BETWEEN THE POSTS BY THE PATH THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH TREAD LIGHTLY OVER THE SNOW AND UP THE STEPS AND KNOCK HASTILY AND VIGOROUSLY AT THE CHURCH DOOR
4898-20016-0007 BUT HALF RECOVERED FROM HIS WONDER HE WAS JUST RAISING HIS VOICE TO UTTER A REMONSTRANCE WHEN TO HIS SEVENFOLD AMAZEMENT THE DOOR WAS OPENED TO THE KNOCK AND THE OLD MAN DISAPPEARED WITHIN
4898-20016-0009 HE DID NOT CARE TO FOLLOW THE STEPS OF THE STRANGER INTO THE CHURCH BUT HE REMEMBERED A SHED SO PLACED AGAINST THE BUILDING NEAR THE FARTHER END THAT HE HAD OFTEN WHEN A CHILD AT SOME PERIL INDEED CLIMBED UPON ITS TOP
4898-20016-0010 AND LOOKED INTO THE CHURCH THROUGH A LITTLE WINDOW AT ONE SIDE OF THE PULPIT FOR THIS HE STARTED BUT HE DID NOT FAIL TO RUN ACROSS THE SQUARE AND LEAP OVER THE CHURCH GATE AT THE TOP OF HIS SPEED
4898-20016-0012 AS HE GLARED THROUGH THE DARKNESS INTO THE OLD KIRK OF ALLOWAY THE GREAT CHANDELIER OF THE CHURCH WAS PARTLY LIGHTED AND THERE WERE BESIDES MANY CANDLES AND LANTERNS BURNING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROOM
4898-20016-0013 WHO WERE DRESSED IN BREECHES AND RUFFLED SHIRTS AND HOOPED PETTICOATS AND TOWERING HEAD DRESSES SUCH AS HE HAD ONLY SEEN IN OLD PICTURES THEY WERE MOUNTED UPON BENCHES AND LADDERS
4898-20016-0015 THE WHOLE PARTY APPEARED FULL OF LIFE AND CHEERFULNESS WHILE THE OLD MAN WHOM NATHAN HAD SEEN ENTER STOOD NEAR THE DOOR LOOKING QUIETLY ON WITH A LITTLE GIRL HOLDING HIS HAND
4898-20016-0016 IT WAS NOT UNTIL NATHAN STODDARD HAD LOOKED FOR SOME LITTLE TIME UPON THIS SPECTACLE THAT HE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT HE WAS WITNESS OF ANY THING MORE THAN NATURAL THE WHOLE PARTY HAD SO HOME LIKE AN AIR
4898-20016-0018 AND BEAUTIFUL AS THEY BROUGHT THEIR TASK TO A CLOSE AND THEIR FOREHEADS WITH THE HAIR BROUGHT BACK IN THE OLD FASHIONED WAY TO BECOME MORE AND MORE SERENE AND HIGH THERE WAS A STRANGE BEAUTY TOO
4898-20016-0019 ABOUT THE OLD MAN'S FACE HE APPEARED TO NATHAN AS IF HE FELT THAT THE GROUP BEFORE HIM ONLY WAITED HIS COMMAND TO FADE AWAY IN THE MORNING LIGHT THAT STRUGGLED AMONG THE CANDLES BUT HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GIVE THE WORD
4898-20016-0021 UNTIL HE FELT THAT HE WAS NEAR SWOONING AND LIKE TO FALL AND HE CLUNG DESPERATELY TO HIS HOLD WHEN THE FIT WAS OVER HE DARED VENTURE NO MORE BUT HASTENED TO THE GROUND
4898-20016-0022 THAT LED NATHAN STODDARD TO KEEP SECRET WHAT HE HAD WITNESSED BUT IT WAS LIKE SOME DEEP AND HOLY EXPERIENCE
4898-20016-0024 THE MINISTER OF NATHAN'S PARISH WAS A YOUNG MAN BY THE NAME OF DUDLEY AND IT SO HAPPENED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN OUT BEFORE LIGHT ON THE MORNING WE HAVE SPOKEN OF TO VISIT A SICK MAN AT SOME DISTANCE
4898-20016-0025 IN RETURNING HOME HE HAD TO PASS ALONG THE RATHER UNFREQUENTED STREET WHICH RUNS IN THE REAR OF HIS CHURCH AND CLOSE TO IT AS HE WAS DRIVING RAPIDLY ALONG HIS EAR CAUGHT WHAT SEEMED THE PEAL OF AN ORGAN
4898-20016-0027 AND DROVE ROUND INTO THE SQUARE TO THE SHOP OF NATHAN STODDARD THERE IS MUSIC TO DAY IN OUR CHURCH NATHAN HE CRIED TO THE YOUNG SADDLER WHAT CAN IT MEAN BUT NATHAN ANSWERED NOT A WORD HE CAUGHT THE HORSE BY THE HEAD
4898-20016-0028 AND FASTENED HIM TO A POST BEFORE THE DOOR THEN STEPPING TO THE SIDE OF THE SLEIGH HE SAID TO MISTER DUDLEY COME WITH ME SIR MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED UPON THE PALE FACE AND TREMBLING LIPS OF HIS PARISHIONER
4898-20016-0030 SAID NATHAN NOT VENTURING A GLANCE HIMSELF MISTER DUDLEY LOOKED AND HAD NOT NATHAN'S ARM BEEN ABOUT HIS BODY HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS HOLD IN SHEER AMAZEMENT THE BUILDING WAS CROWDED AS HE HAD NEVER KNOWN IT BEFORE
4898-20016-0031 AND CROWDED WITH PEOPLE WHOM HIS EYE VERSED IN THE DRESS AND MANNERS OF OUR FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED AS THE CHURCH GOERS OF A CENTURY AND A HALF AGO THE SINGERS GALLERY WAS FILLED BY A CHOIR OF GIRLS AND BOYS
4898-20016-0033 HE WAS LEANING OVER THE GREAT BIBLE WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED UPON IT AND HIS EYES SEEMINGLY FILLED WITH TEARS OF PLEASURE AND GRATITUDE AND BENT UPON THE CHOIR MISTER DUDLEY LISTENED INTENTLY
4898-20016-0034 BY THIS TIME THE SOUND OF A GATHERING CROWD BELOW WHICH HE HAD NOT HEEDED AT FIRST WAS FORCED MORE AND MORE UPON HIS NOTICE AND THE ANXIOUS VOICE OF HIS OLDEST DEACON CALLING MISTER DUDLEY MISTER DUDLEY
4898-20016-0036 MISTER DUDLEY HASTENED ROUND TO PREVENT THEIR CAUSING ANY DISTURBANCE TO THE CONGREGATION WITHIN BUT HE CAME ONLY IN TIME TO SEE THE DOOR BURST OPEN AND TO BE BORNE IN WITH THE CROWD ALL GAZED ABOUT IN WONDER
4898-20016-0037 HAD BEEN FAIRLY DRESSED FOR CHRISTMAS BY SPIRIT HANDS WHEN MISTER DUDLEY REACHED HIS HOME AFTER THE WONDER HAD IN PART SPENT ITSELF HE FOUND THAT AN ENORMOUS CHRISTMAS PIE
4898-20016-0039 IN A TREMULOUS BUT VERY KIND VOICE GIVE YOUR MASTER THE CHRISTMAS BLESSING OF AN OLD PURITAN MINISTER HOW THE MEANING OF THIS MESSAGE WOULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO MISTER DUDLEY HAD NOT THE EVENTS WE HAVE TOLD DISCLOSED IT
4898-20016-0040 AND THAT HE AVOWS THE INTENTION OF OBSERVING THE CHRISTMAS OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR WITH PUBLIC SERVICES UNLESS INDEED HE SHOULD BE ANTICIPATED BY HIS ANCIENT PREDECESSOR
4898-28461-0001 BEYOND THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE TERRITORY GASHED BY STUPENDOUS CANYONS
4898-28461-0002 THOUGH MOST OF THEM ARE COMPARATIVELY SHORT AS THEIR HIGHEST SOURCES LIE IN THE ICY SOLITUDES OF THE RANGE WITHIN FORTY OR FIFTY MILES OF THE COAST A FEW HOWEVER OF THESE FOAMING ROARING STREAMS
4898-28461-0004 ARE STILL OCCUPIED BY GLACIERS WHICH DESCEND IN SHOWY RANKS THEIR MESSY BULGING SNOUTS LYING BACK A LITTLE DISTANCE IN THE SHADOWS OF THE WALLS OR PUSHING FORWARD AMONG THE COTTON WOODS
4898-28461-0005 THAT LINE THE BANKS OF THE RIVERS OR EVEN STRETCHING ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAIN CANYONS COMPELLING THE RIVERS TO FIND A CHANNEL BENEATH THEM THE STICKEEN WAS PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE RIVERS THAT CROSS THE COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0007 AND SOMETIMES TO TELEGRAPH CREEK FIFTEEN MILES FARTHER IT FIRST PURSUES A WESTERLY COURSE THROUGH GRASSY PLAINS DARKENED HERE AND THERE WITH GROVES OF SPRUCE AND PINE
4898-28461-0008 THEN CURVING SOUTHWARD AND RECEIVING NUMEROUS TRIBUTARIES FROM THE NORTH IT ENTERS THE COAST RANGE AND SWEEPS ACROSS IT THROUGH A MAGNIFICENT CANYON THREE THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND FEET DEEP
4898-28461-0010 THE MOST STRIKING FEATURES ARE THE GLACIERS HANGING OVER THE CLIFFS DESCENDING THE SIDE CANYONS AND PUSHING FORWARD TO THE RIVER GREATLY ENHANCING THE WILD BEAUTY OF ALL THE OTHERS
4898-28461-0011 GLIDING ALONG THE SWIFT FLOWING RIVER THE VIEWS CHANGE WITH BEWILDERING RAPIDITY WONDERFUL TOO ARE THE CHANGES DEPENDENT ON THE SEASONS AND THE WEATHER IN SPRING WHEN THE SNOW IS MELTING FAST
4898-28461-0013 FROM MILES OF WILD ROSES CLOVER AND HONEYSUCKLE THE SWATHS OF BIRCH AND WILLOW ON THE LOWER SLOPES FOLLOWING THE MELTING OF THE WINTER AVALANCHE SNOW BANKS
4898-28461-0014 THE BOSSY CUMULI SWELLING IN WHITE AND PURPLE PILES ABOVE THE HIGHEST PEAKS GRAY RAIN CLOUDS WREATHING THE OUTSTANDING BROWS AND BATTLEMENTS OF THE WALLS
4898-28461-0016 AND THE SERENE COLOR GRANDEUR OF THE MORNING AND EVENING SKY IN SUMMER YOU FIND THE GROVES AND GARDENS IN FULL DRESS GLACIERS MELTING RAPIDLY UNDER SUNSHINE AND RAIN WATERFALLS IN ALL THEIR GLORY
4898-28461-0017 THE RIVER REJOICING IN ITS STRENGTH YOUNG BIRDS TRYING THEIR WINGS BEARS ENJOYING SALMON AND BERRIES ALL THE LIFE OF THE CANYON BRIMMING FULL LIKE THE STREAMS IN AUTUMN COMES REST AS IF THE YEAR'S WORK WERE DONE
4898-28461-0019 THE ROCKS ALSO AND THE GLACIERS SEEM TO BLOOM LIKE THE PLANTS IN THE MELLOW GOLDEN LIGHT AND SO GOES THE SONG CHANGE SUCCEEDING CHANGE IN SUBLIME HARMONY THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL SEASONS AND WEATHER
4898-28461-0020 MY FIRST TRIP UP THE RIVER WAS MADE IN THE SPRING WITH THE MISSIONARY PARTY SOON AFTER OUR ARRIVAL AT WRANGELL WE LEFT WRANGELL IN THE AFTERNOON AND ANCHORED FOR THE NIGHT ABOVE THE RIVER DELTA
4898-28461-0022 THE SUNBEAMS STREAMING THROUGH THE ICE PINNACLES ALONG ITS TERMINAL WALL PRODUCED A WONDERFUL GLORY OF COLOR AND THE BROAD SPARKLING CRYSTAL PRAIRIE AND THE DISTANT SNOWY FOUNTAINS WERE WONDERFULLY ATTRACTIVE
4898-28461-0023 AND EXPANDS IN A BROAD FAN FIVE OR SIX MILES IN WIDTH SEPARATED FROM THE STICKEEN RIVER BY ITS BROAD TERMINAL MORAINE FRINGED WITH SPRUCES AND WILLOWS AROUND THE BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN CURVE OF THE MORAINE
4898-28461-0025 CIRQUES AND BRANCH CANYONS ALONG THE TOPS AND SIDES OF THE WALLS THE INDIANS HAVE A TRADITION THAT THE RIVER USED TO RUN THROUGH A TUNNEL UNDER THE UNITED FRONTS OF THE TWO LARGE TRIBUTARY GLACIERS MENTIONED ABOVE
4898-28461-0026 WHICH ENTERED THE MAIN CANYON FROM EITHER SIDE AND THAT ON ONE OCCASION AN INDIAN ANXIOUS TO GET RID OF HIS WIFE HAD HER SENT ADRIFT IN A CANOE DOWN THROUGH THE ICE TUNNEL EXPECTING THAT SHE WOULD TROUBLE HIM NO MORE
4898-28461-0028 AND HAD RECEDED TO A GREATER OR LESSER HEIGHT ABOVE THE VALLEY FLOOR THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS HARDLY OUT OF SIGHT ERE YOU COME UPON ANOTHER THAT POURS A MAJESTIC CRYSTAL FLOOD
4898-28461-0029 THROUGH THE EVERGREENS WHILE ALMOST EVERY HOLLOW AND TRIBUTARY CANYON CONTAINS A SMALLER ONE THE SIZE OF COURSE VARYING WITH THE EXTENT OF THE AREA DRAINED SOME ARE LIKE MERE SNOW BANKS OTHERS WITH THE BLUE ICE APPARENT
4898-28461-0031 WITH GOLD DUST IN THEIR EYES THIRTY FIVE MILES ABOVE THE BIG STICKEEN GLACIER IS THE DIRT GLACIER THE SECOND IN SIZE ITS OUTLET IS A FINE STREAM ABOUNDING IN TROUT
4898-28461-0032 ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE RIVER THERE IS A GROUP OF FIVE GLACIERS ONE OF THEM DESCENDING TO WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET OF THE RIVER NEAR GLENORA ON THE NORTHEASTERN FLANK OF THE MAIN COAST RANGE
4898-28461-0034 AND DEPOSITED ON THE FIRST OPEN LEVELS BELOW HERE TOO OCCURS A MARKED CHANGE IN CLIMATE AND CONSEQUENTLY IN FORESTS AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY ON ACCOUNT OF DESTRUCTIVE FIRES THE WOODS ARE YOUNGER
4898-28461-0035 AND ARE COMPOSED OF SMALLER TREES ABOUT A FOOT TO EIGHTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER AND SEVENTY FIVE FEET HIGH MOSTLY TWO LEAVED PINES WHICH HOLD THEIR SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THEY ARE RIPE THE WOODS HERE ARE WITHOUT A TRACE
4898-28461-0037 WHERE THE FOREST HAS BEEN UTTERLY DESTROYED THE RIVER BANK COTTONWOODS ARE ALSO SMALLER AND THE BIRCH AND CONTORTA PINES MINGLE FREELY WITH THE COAST HEMLOCK AND SPRUCE THE BIRCH IS COMMON ON THE LOWER SLOPES
4898-28461-0038 AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE ITS ROUND LEAFY PALE GREEN HEAD CONTRASTING WITH THE DARK NARROW SPIRES OF THE CONIFERS AND GIVING A STRIKING CHARACTER TO THE FOREST THE TAMARAC PINE OR BLACK PINE AS THE VARIETY OF
4898-28461-0040 I SAW FINE SPECIMENS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH ON DEEP BOTTOM LAND A FEW MILES BELOW GLENORA THE TOPS OF SOME OF THEM WERE ALMOST COVERED WITH DENSE CLUSTERS OF YELLOW AND BROWN CONES
4898-28461-0041 WE REACHED THE OLD HUDSON'S BAY TRADING POST AT GLENORA ABOUT ONE O'CLOCK AND THE CAPTAIN INFORMED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP HERE UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE WOULD MAKE AN EARLY START FOR WRANGELL
4898-28461-0043 EIGHT THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA AND AS GLENORA IS ONLY A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE THE SEA
4898-28461-0044 BECAUSE OF THE ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION IT OCCUPIED FOR GENERAL VIEWS OF THE PEAKS AND GLACIERS OF THE EAST SIDE OF THE GREAT RANGE ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOW TWENTY MINUTES PAST THREE AND THE DAYS WERE GETTING SHORT
4898-28461-0046 A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A SEASONED MOUNTAINEER TO BE DONE IN LESS THAN HALF A DAY AND PART OF A NIGHT BUT HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS A STRONG WALKER COULD DO A MOUNTAINEER'S DAY'S WORK IN HALF A DAY AND WOULD NOT HINDER ME IN ANY WAY
4898-28461-0047 WELL I HAVE WARNED YOU I SAID AND WILL NOT ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY TROUBLE THAT MAY ARISE HE PROVED TO BE A STOUT WALKER AND WE MADE RAPID PROGRESS ACROSS A BRUSHY TIMBERED FLAT
4898-28461-0049 WHEN WE WERE NEAR A CLUSTER OF CRUMBLING PINNACLES THAT FORMED THE SUMMIT I HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANXIETY ABOUT THE MOUNTAINEERING STRENGTH AND SKILL OF MY COMPANION AND PUSHED RAPIDLY ON IN PASSING AROUND THE SHOULDER OF THE HIGHEST PINNACLE
4898-28461-0050 WHERE THE ROCK WAS RAPIDLY DISINTEGRATING AND THE DANGER OF SLIPPING WAS GREAT I SHOUTED IN A WARNING VOICE BE VERY CAREFUL HERE THIS IS DANGEROUS MISTER YOUNG WAS PERHAPS A DOZEN OR TWO YARDS BEHIND ME BUT OUT OF SIGHT
4898-28461-0052 TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS NOT INTERRUPTED BY SHEER PRECIPICES I CONCLUDED THAT WITH GREAT CARE AND THE DIGGING OF SLIGHT FOOTHOLDS HE COULD BE SLID DOWN TO THE GLACIER WHERE I COULD LAY HIM ON HIS BACK AND PERHAPS BE ABLE TO SET HIS ARMS
4898-28461-0053 I REACHED UP TOOK HOLD OF HIM BY ONE OF HIS FEET AND GENTLY SLID HIM DOWN ON HIS BACK
4898-28461-0055 AND THE GLACIER WAS REACHED PERHAPS ABOUT MIDNIGHT HERE I TOOK OFF ONE OF MY BOOTS TIED A HANDKERCHIEF AROUND HIS WRIST FOR A GOOD HOLD
4898-28461-0056 AND SUCCEEDED IN GETTING ONE OF HIS ARMS INTO PLACE
4898-28461-0058 I MARCHED HIM SLOWLY DOWN IN THE STARLIGHT ON THE COMPARATIVELY SMOOTH
4898-28461-0059 A DISTANCE OF PERHAPS A MILE CROSSED THE MORAINE BATHED HIS HEAD AT ONE OF THE OUTLET STREAMS AND AFTER MANY RESTS REACHED A DRY PLACE AND MADE A BRUSH FIRE I THEN WENT AHEAD LOOKING FOR AN OPEN WAY
4898-28461-0061 I REMINDED HIM OF THE ROUGHNESS OF THE WAY HIS NERVE SHAKEN CONDITION AND ASSURED HIM I WOULD NOT BE GONE LONG BUT HE INSISTED ON TRYING
4898-28461-0062 AND MADE HIM LEAN ON MY SHOULDER WHILE I STEADIED HIM TO PREVENT HIS FALLING THIS SLOW STAGGERING STRUGGLE FROM FIRE TO FIRE LASTED UNTIL LONG AFTER SUNRISE WHEN AT LAST WE REACHED THE SHIP AND STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE NARROW SINGLE PLANK
4898-28461-0064 THEY MADE HASTE TO REPROACH HIM FOR HAVING GONE ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH MUIR THESE FOOLISH ADVENTURES ARE WELL ENOUGH FOR MISTER MUIR THEY SAID BUT YOU MISTER YOUNG HAVE A WORK TO DO YOU HAVE A FAMILY YOU HAVE A CHURCH
4898-28461-0065 AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO RISK YOUR LIFE ON TREACHEROUS PEAKS AND PRECIPICES
4898-28461-0067 WHILE HE WENT ON DOWN THE RIVER ABOUT HIS BUSINESS BUT WHEN HE HEARD MY CALL FOR HELP HE HASTENED FORWARD AND ELBOWED THE DIVINES AWAY FROM THE END OF THE GANGPLANK SHOUTING IN ANGRY IRREVERENCE OH BLANK THIS IS NO TIME FOR PREACHING
4898-28461-0068 THEN WITH A MAN HOLDING DOWN HIS SHOULDERS WE SUCCEEDED IN GETTING THE BONE INTO ITS SOCKET NOTWITHSTANDING THE INFLAMMATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE MUSCLES AND LIGAMENTS MISTER YOUNG WAS THEN PUT TO BED AND HE SLEPT ALL THE WAY BACK TO WRANGELL
5022-29405-0001 I FEEL AT A LOSS HOW TO REPLY NOT ONE IMPRESSION BUT MANY IMPRESSIONS TROUBLED AND CONFUSED MY MIND CERTAIN PASSAGES IN THE CONFESSION INCLINED ME TO BELIEVE THAT THE WRITER WAS MAD BUT I ALTERED MY OPINION AT THE NEXT LEAF
5022-29405-0002 AND SET HIM DOWN AS A MAN WITH A BITTER HUMOR
5022-29405-0004 ALMOST MADE ME REGRET THAT HE HAD NOT DIED OF THE ILLNESS WHICH HAD STRUCK HIM DEAF
5022-29405-0005 AT ONE POSITIVE CONCLUSION AS STRANGERS HE AND I HAD FIRST MET AS STRANGERS I WAS DETERMINED WE SHOULD REMAIN HAVING MADE UP MY MIND SO FAR THE NEXT THING TO DO WITH THE CLOCK ON THE MANTEL PIECE STRIKING MIDNIGHT WAS TO GO TO BED
5022-29405-0007 THE POOR GIRL AS I WAS STILL INCLINED TO FEAR MIGHT HAVE SERIOUS REASON TO REGRET THAT HE HAD EVER ENTERED HER FATHER'S COTTAGE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE MY STEPMOTHER AND I MET AGAIN MISSUS ROYLAKE IN AN EXQUISITE MORNING DRESS WITH HER SMILE IN PERFECT ORDER
5022-29405-0008 INFORMED ME THAT SHE WAS DYING WITH CURIOSITY SHE HAD HEARD FROM THE SERVANTS THAT I HAD NOT RETURNED TO THE HOUSE UNTIL PAST TEN O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT AND SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY BEWILDERED BY THE DISCOVERY WHAT COULD HER DEAR GERARD HAVE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE DARK BY HIMSELF
5022-29405-0010 MISSUS ROYLAKE'S FASCINATING SMILE DISAPPEARED WHEN I MENTIONED THE MILL SHE SUDDENLY BECAME A COLD LADY I MIGHT EVEN SAY A STIFF LADY
5022-29405-0011 OF COURSE THAT BOLD GIRL CONTRIVED TO ATTRACT YOUR NOTICE I REPLIED THAT I HAD MET WITH THE BOLD GIRL PURELY BY ACCIDENT ON HER SIDE AS WELL AS ON MINE AND THEN I STARTED A NEW TOPIC
5022-29405-0013 MY STEPMOTHER WAS HER CHARMING SELF AGAIN THE MOMENT MY QUESTION HAD PASSED MY LIPS SOCIETY PROVIDED IT WAS NOT SOCIETY AT THE MILL WAS ALWAYS ATTRACTIVE AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION YOUR ABSENCE WAS THE ONLY DRAWBACK SHE ANSWERED
5022-29405-0014 I HAVE ASKED THE TWO LADIES MY LORD HAS AN ENGAGEMENT TO DINE HERE TO DAY WITHOUT CEREMONY THEY ARE MOST ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU MY DEAR GERARD YOU LOOK SURPRISED
5022-29405-0016 EITHER I HAD FORGOTTEN LORD UPPERCLIFF DURING MY LONG ABSENCE ABROAD OR I HAD NEVER HEARD OF HIM
5022-29405-0017 WE WILL DRIVE OUT AFTER LUNCHEON AND PAY A ROUND OF VISITS WHEN THIS PROSPECT WAS PLACED BEFORE ME I REMEMBERED HAVING READ IN BOOKS OF SENSITIVE PERSONS RECEIVING IMPRESSIONS WHICH MADE THEIR BLOOD RUN COLD
5022-29405-0019 I ADMIRE HER INTELLECT BUT HER POLITICAL AND SOCIAL OPINIONS I MUST ALWAYS VIEW WITH REGRET
5022-29405-0020 IS SIMPLY THE MOST CHARMING GIRL IN ENGLAND IF YOU DON'T FALL IN LOVE WITH HER
5022-29405-0022 YOU WANT TO SMOKE AFTER BREAKFAST WELL I WON'T BE IN YOUR WAY GO OUT ON THE TERRACE YOUR POOR FATHER ALWAYS TOOK HIS CIGAR ON THE TERRACE THEY SAY SMOKING LEADS TO MEDITATION I LEAVE YOU TO MEDITATE ON LADY LENA DON'T FORGET
5022-29405-0023 SHE SMILED AND KISSED HER HAND AND FLUTTERED OUT OF THE ROOM CHARMING PERFECTLY CHARMING AND YET I WAS UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO WISH MYSELF BACK IN GERMANY AGAIN I LIT MY CIGAR BUT NOT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29405-0025 THE SOONER I RETURNED IT TO THE WRITER OF THE CONFESSION THE SOONER I TOLD HIM PLAINLY THE CONCLUSION AT WHICH I HAD ARRIVED THE MORE AT EASE MY MIND WOULD BE THE SLUGGISH RIVER LOOKED MUDDIER THAN EVER THE NEW COTTAGE LOOKED UGLIER THAN EVER
5022-29405-0026 I KNOCKED AT THE DOOR ON THE ANCIENT SIDE OF THE BUILDING
5022-29405-0028 MY MEALS DON'T SHOW ON ME YOU WILL EXCUSE MY RECEIVING YOU IN THE KITCHEN SIR IT'S THE BEST ROOM WE HAVE DID CRISTY TELL YOU HOW BADLY WE ARE OFF HERE FOR REPAIRS YOU BEING OUR LANDLORD WE LOOK TO YOU TO HELP US WE ARE FALLING TO PIECES AS IT WERE
5022-29405-0029 ON THIS OLD SIDE OF THE HOUSE THERE'S FIRST DRAINS HE PROCEEDED TO RECKON UP THE REPAIRS COUNTING WITH HIS FLESHLESS THUMB ON HIS SKINNY FINGERS WHEN HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A CURIOUS SUCCESSION OF SOUNDS WHICH BEGAN WITH WHINING AND ENDED WITH SCRATCHING AT THE COTTAGE DOOR
5022-29405-0031 I NOW SAW IN THEIR FULL BEAUTY THE LUSTER OF HER BROWN EYES THE WARM ROSINESS OF HER DARK COMPLEXION THE DELIGHTFUL VIVACITY OF EXPRESSION WHICH WAS THE CROWNING CHARM OF HER FACE SHE PAUSED CONFUSEDLY IN THE DOORWAY
5022-29405-0032 AND TRIED TO RESIST ME WHEN I INSISTED ON RELIEVING HER OF THE BASKET MISTER GERARD SHE PROTESTED
5022-29405-0034 HE SAYS ALL RIGHT AND HE DOES NOTHING THERE'S FIRST AS I TOLD YOU JUST NOW THE TRULY DREADFUL STATE OF THE DRAINS I TRIED TO STOP HIM BY PROMISING TO SPEAK TO THE BAILIFF MYSELF ON HEARING THIS GOOD NEWS MISTER TOLLER'S GRATITUDE BECAME UNGOVERNABLE
5022-29405-0035 HE WAS MORE EAGER THAN EVER AND MORE ELOQUENT THAN EVER IN RETURNING TO THE REPAIRS AND THEN SIR THERE'S THE OVEN THEY DO CALL BREAD THE STAFF OF LIFE IT'S A BURNT STAFF AT ONE TIME AND A CLAMMY STAFF AT ANOTHER
5022-29405-0037 WHEN WE WERE ALL THREE DISTURBED BY ANOTHER INTERRUPTION A SECOND DOOR COMMUNICATING AS I CONCLUDED FROM ITS POSITION WITH THE NEW COTTAGE WAS SUDDENLY OPENED IN THE INSTANT BEFORE THE PERSON BEHIND IT APPEARED THE DOG LOOKED THAT WAY
5022-29405-0038 STARTED UP FRIGHTENED AND TOOK REFUGE UNDER THE TABLE AT THE NEXT MOMENT THE DEAF LODGER WALKED INTO THE ROOM IT WAS HE BEYOND ALL DOUBT WHO HAD FRIGHTENED THE DOG FOREWARNED BY INSTINCT OF HIS APPEARANCE
5022-29405-0040 HIS PERSONAL ATTRACTIONS TRIUMPHED IN THE CLEAR SEARCHING LIGHT I NOW PERCEIVED THAT HIS EYES WERE OF THAT DEEPLY DARK BLUE WHICH IS COMMONLY AND FALSELY DESCRIBED AS RESEMBLING THE COLOR OF THE VIOLET TO MY THINKING THEY WERE SO ENTIRELY BEAUTIFUL
5022-29405-0041 THAT THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO BE IN A MAN'S FACE
5022-29405-0043 AND THE SIGNS OF MASCULINE RESOLUTION PRESENTED BY HIS MOUTH AND CHIN ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST PERSON AND THE ONLY PERSON WHO ATTRACTED HIS ATTENTION WAS CRISTEL HE BOWED SMILED POSSESSED HIMSELF ABRUPTLY OF HER HAND AND KISSED IT
5022-29411-0000 MY LOYALTY TOWARDS THE AFFLICTED MAN WHOSE FRIENDLY ADVANCES I HAD SEEN GOOD REASON TO RETURN WAS IN NO SENSE SHAKEN HIS UNDESERVED MISFORTUNES HIS MANLY APPEAL TO ME AT THE SPRING
5022-29411-0002 IF I HAD BEEN A PHILOSOPHER I SHOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED THE SYMPTOMS OF A VERY COMMON ATTACK OF A VERY WIDELY SPREAD MORAL MALADY THE MEANEST OF ALL HUMAN INFIRMITIES IS ALSO THE MOST UNIVERSAL AND THE NAME OF IT IS SELF ESTEEM
5022-29411-0003 IT IS PERHAPS ONLY RIGHT TO ADD THAT MY PATIENCE HAD BEEN TRIED BY THE PROGRESS OF DOMESTIC EVENTS WHICH AFFECTED LADY LENA AND MYSELF VIEWED AS VICTIMS CALLING WITH MY STEPMOTHER AT LORD UPPERCLIFF'S HOUSE LATER IN THE DAY
5022-29411-0005 NOTICED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWO LADIES AND SEEMED TO BE AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND THEM WHEN MISSUS ROYLAKE AND I WERE TOGETHER AGAIN ON OUR WAY HOME I WAS PREPARED TO HEAR THE PRAISE OF LADY LENA FOLLOWED BY A DELICATE EXAMINATION INTO THE STATE OF MY HEART
5022-29411-0006 NEITHER OF THESE ANTICIPATIONS WAS REALIZED ONCE MORE MY CLEVER STEPMOTHER HAD PUZZLED ME MISSUS ROYLAKE TALKED AS FLUENTLY AS EVER EXHAUSTING ONE COMMON PLACE SUBJECT AFTER ANOTHER
5022-29411-0008 RETURNING TO THE HOUSE I TRIED TO OCCUPY MYSELF WITH MY COLLECTION OF INSECTS SADLY NEGLECTED OF LATE USELESS MY OWN MOTHS FAILED TO INTEREST ME I WENT BACK TO THE GARDEN PASSING THE OPEN WINDOW OF ONE OF THE LOWER ROOMS WHICH LOOKED OUT ON THE TERRACE
5022-29411-0009 I SAW MISSUS ROYLAKE READING A BOOK IN SAD COLORED BINDING SHE WAS YAWNING OVER IT FEARFULLY WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT I WAS LOOKING AT HER EQUAL TO ANY EMERGENCY THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN INSTANTLY HANDED TO ME A SECOND AND SIMILAR VOLUME
5022-29411-0011 WHICH WAY DID I TURN MY STEPS MEN WILL WONDER WHAT POSSESSED ME WOMEN WILL THINK IT A PROCEEDING THAT DID ME CREDIT I TOOK THE FAMILIAR ROAD WHICH LED TO THE GLOOMY WOOD AND THE GUILTY RIVER THE LONGING IN ME TO SEE CRISTEL AGAIN WAS MORE THAN I COULD RESIST
5022-29411-0012 NOT BECAUSE I WAS IN LOVE WITH HER ONLY BECAUSE I HAD LEFT HER IN DISTRESS BEYOND THE SPRING AND WITHIN A SHORT DISTANCE OF THE RIVER I SAW A LADY ADVANCING TOWARDS ME ON THE PATH WHICH LED FROM THE MILL BRISK SMILING TRIPPING ALONG LIKE A YOUNG GIRL
5022-29411-0014 PATRONIZING PIETY ON THE WAY TO AFTERNOON CHURCH I MUST POSITIVELY MAKE A SKETCH OF THE COTTAGE BY THE MILL I MEAN OF COURSE THE PICTURESQUE SIDE OF IT THAT FINE GIRL OF TOLLER'S WAS STANDING AT THE DOOR SHE IS REALLY HANDSOMER THAN EVER ARE YOU GOING TO SEE HER YOU WICKED MAN
5022-29411-0015 WHEN WE HAD LEFT EACH OTHER I THOUGHT OF THE ABSENT CAPTAIN IN THE NAVY WHO WAS LADY RACHEL'S HUSBAND HE WAS A PERFECT STRANGER BUT I PUT MYSELF IN HIS PLACE AND FELT THAT I TOO SHOULD HAVE GONE TO SEA
5022-29411-0017 HE SWEARS SIR THAT HE WON'T GO AT THE END OF HIS WEEK'S NOTICE
5022-29411-0018 AND SHOOT THE MAN AND SHOOT HIMSELF AHA
5022-29411-0020 ABOUT CRISTEL AFTER LOOKING ROUND THE KITCHEN AGAIN I ASKED WHERE SHE WAS SITTING FORLORN IN HER BEDROOM CRYING HER FATHER TOLD ME I WENT OUT FOR A WALK BY THE RIVER AND I SAT DOWN AND BEING SUNDAY I FELL ASLEEP WHEN I WOKE AND GOT HOME AGAIN JUST NOW THAT
5022-29411-0021 WAS HOW I FOUND HER I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR MY GIRL CRYING SHE'S AS GOOD AS GOLD AND BETTER NO SIR OUR DEAF DEVIL IS NOT TO BLAME FOR THIS HE HAS GIVEN CRISTY NO REASON TO COMPLAIN OF HIM SHE SAYS SO HERSELF AND SHE NEVER TOLD A LIE YET
5022-29411-0023 YOU WILL ASK ME WHO THE PERSON IS
5022-29411-0024 BUT YOU MEAN TO TRY YES I MEAN TO TRY HE ANSWERED ME WITH LITTLE OF THE ENERGY WHICH GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED HIM PERHAPS HE WAS FATIGUED OR PERHAPS HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO THINK OF I OFFERED A SUGGESTION WHEN WE ARE
5022-29411-0026 I'VE GOT BURDENS ON MY MIND HE EXPLAINED OR I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT TOO HAVING DONE JUSTICE TO HIS OWN ABILITIES HE BUSTLED OUT IN LESS THAN A MINUTE HE WAS BACK AGAIN IN A STATE OF BREATHLESS TRIUMPH GLOODY HAS SEEN THE PERSON HE ANNOUNCED AND
5022-29411-0027 I BECKONED TO GLOODY WAITING MODESTLY AT THE DOOR TO COME IN AND TELL ME WHAT HE HAD DISCOVERED I SAW HER OUTSIDE SIR RAPPING AT THE DOOR HERE WITH HER PARASOL THAT WAS THE SERVANT'S REPORT HER PARASOL
5022-29411-0029 THE HAT I HAD SEEN ON THE HEAD OF THAT HATEFUL WOMAN WAS NOW SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED FOR A MAN SLY OLD TOLLER LEAVING GLOODY UNNOTICED AND KEEPING HIS EYE ON ME SAW THE SIGNS OF CONVICTION IN MY FACE AND SAID WITH HIS CUSTOMARY AUDACITY
5022-29411-0030 WHO IS SHE I FOLLOWED AT MY HUMBLE DISTANCE THE EXAMPLE OF SIR WALTER SCOTT WHEN INQUISITIVE PEOPLE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS IN PLAIN ENGLISH I DENIED ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE STRANGER WEARING THE GREEN HAT
5022-29411-0032 HE LED ME TO THE DOOR OF HIS DAUGHTER'S ROOM AND STOOD CLOSE BY WHEN I KNOCKED SOFTLY AND BEGGED THAT SHE WOULD COME OUT THE TONE OF THE POOR GIRL'S VOICE ANSWERING FORGIVE ME SIR I CAN'T DO IT CONVICTED THE SHE SOCIALIST AS I THOUGHT
5022-29411-0033 OF MERCILESS CONDUCT OF SOME SORT ASSUMING THIS CONCLUSION TO BE THE RIGHT ONE I DETERMINED THEN AND THERE THAT LADY RACHEL SHOULD NOT PASS THE DOORS OF TRIMLEY DEEN AGAIN IF HER BOSOM FRIEND RESENTED THAT WISE ACT OF SEVERITY BY LEAVING THE HOUSE I SHOULD SUBMIT WITH RESIGNATION
5022-29411-0035 PRAY BE KINDER TO ME THAN EVER PRAY LET ME BE I SAID I WOULD RETURN ON THE NEXT DAY AND LEFT THE ROOM WITH A SORE HEART OLD TOLLER HIGHLY APPROVED OF MY CONDUCT HE RUBBED HIS FLESHLESS HANDS AND WHISPERED
5022-29411-0036 YOU'LL GET IT OUT OF CRISTY TO MORROW AND I'LL HELP YOU I FOUND GLOODY WAITING FOR ME OUTSIDE THE COTTAGE HE WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT MISS CRISTEL HIS ONLY EXCUSE HE TOLD ME BEING THE FEAR THAT SHE MIGHT BE ILL HAVING SET HIM AT EASE IN THAT PARTICULAR I SAID
5022-29411-0038 I FAILED TO SEE IT MYSELF IN THAT LIGHT IT STRUCK ME AS I WALKED HOME THAT CRISTEL MIGHT HAVE MADE MANY A WORSE FRIEND THAN THE RETIRED PRIZE FIGHTER A CHANGE IN MY MANNER WAS OF COURSE REMARKED BY MISSUS ROYLAKE'S READY OBSERVATION
5022-29411-0039 I TOLD HER THAT I HAD BEEN ANNOYED AND OFFERED NO OTHER EXPLANATION WONDERFUL TO RELATE SHE SHOWED NO CURIOSITY AND NO SURPRISE MORE WONDERFUL STILL AT EVERY FAIR OPPORTUNITY THAT OFFERED SHE KEPT OUT OF MY WAY
5022-29411-0041 ON THE RIVER MARGIN OF THE WOOD I WAS CONFRONTED BY A WILD GLEAM OF BEAUTY IN THE FAMILIAR VIEW FOR WHICH PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE HAD NOT PREPARED ME AM I WRONG IN BELIEVING THAT ALL SCENERY NO MATTER HOW MAGNIFICENT OR HOW HOMELY IT MAY BE
5022-29411-0042 DERIVES A SPLENDOR NOT ITS OWN FROM FAVOURING CONDITIONS OF LIGHT AND SHADE OUR GLOOMY TREES AND OUR REPELLENT RIVER PRESENTED AN ASPECT SUPERBLY TRANSFIGURED UNDER THE SHADOWS OF THE TOWERING CLOUDS THE FANTASTIC WREATHS OF THE MIST
5022-29411-0044 WHILE IT DIMMED THE TURBID EARTHY YELLOW THAT DISCOLORED AND DEGRADED THE STREAM UNDER THE FULL GLARE OF DAY WHILE MY EYES FOLLOWED THE SUCCESSIVE TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE VIEW AS THE HOUR ADVANCED TENDER AND SOLEMN INFLUENCES BREATHED THEIR BALM OVER MY MIND
5022-29411-0045 DAYS HAPPY DAYS THAT WERE PAST REVIVED AGAIN I WALKED HAND IN HAND WITH MY MOTHER AMONG THE SCENES THAT WERE ROUND ME AND LEARNT FROM HER TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THE BEAUTY OF THE EARTH WITH A HEART THAT FELT IT
5022-29411-0047 I THANKED THE LITTLE MILL GIRL AND GAVE HER A KISS DID I FEEL THE CHILD'S BREATH IN MY DAY DREAM STILL FLUTTERING ON MY CHEEK WAS I CONSCIOUS OF HER TOUCH I STARTED TREMBLED RETURNED RELUCTANTLY TO MY PRESENT SELF
5022-29411-0048 A VISIBLE HAND TOUCHED MY ARM AS I TURNED SUDDENLY A LIVING BREATH PLAYED ON MY FACE THE CHILD HAD FADED INTO A VANISHING SHADE THE PERFECTED WOMAN WHO HAD GROWN FROM HER HAD STOLEN ON ME UNAWARES AND WAS ASKING ME TO PARDON HER
5022-29411-0050 YOU HAVE SURPRISED ME I ANSWERED SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST WHAT IS IT NOTHING I ADVANCED A STEP AND DREW HER CLOSER TO ME A DARK FLUSH DISCOLORED HER FACE AN OVERPOWERING BRILLIANCY FLASHED FROM HER EYES
5022-29411-0051 THERE WAS AN HYSTERICAL DEFIANCE IN HER MANNER ARE YOU EXCITED ARE YOU ANGRY ARE YOU TRYING TO STARTLE ME BY ACTING A PART I URGED THOSE QUESTIONS ON HER ONE AFTER ANOTHER AND I WAS LOUDLY AND CONFIDENTLY ANSWERED
5022-29411-0053 I KNOW THAT SHE HAS VISITED YOU AND SPOKEN TO YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHE HAS SAID I CAN GUESS
5022-29411-0054 HER MANNER HAD BECOME QUIETER HER FACE WAS MORE COMPOSED HER EXPRESSION ALMOST RECOVERED ITS NATURAL CHARM WHILE SHE SPOKE OF LADY RACHEL I WAS STUPEFIED TRY SIR TO FORGET IT AND FORGIVE IT SHE RESUMED GENTLY
5022-29411-0056 IN THAT SHORT TIME I TOLD HER THAT HE HAD BEEN FOUND IN MY GARDEN LOOKING AT THE FLOWERS AS HE HAD DONE NO HARM I SAID
5022-29411-0057 AND FELT I DON'T DOUBT IT I HAD INTENDED TO SAY NO MORE THAN THIS BUT THE REMEMBRANCE OF GLOODY'S MYSTERIOUS PREVARICATION AND OF THE UNEASINESS WHICH I HAD UNDOUBTEDLY FELT WHEN I THOUGHT OF IT AFTERWARDS LED ME I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY HOW
5022-29411-0059 I AM NOT SURE WHETHER I HAVE MENTIONED THAT THE NAME OF THE PLACE WAS KYLAM IT WAS SITUATED BEHIND A PROMONTORY OF THE RIVER BANK CLOTHED THICKLY WITH TREES AND WAS NOT VISIBLE FROM THE MILL IN THE PRESENT DIRECTION OF THE WIND WE COULD HEAR THE STRIKING OF THE CHURCH CLOCK
5022-29411-0060 CRISTEL COUNTED THE STROKES SEVEN SHE SAID ARE YOU DETERMINED TO KEEP YOUR ENGAGEMENT SHE HAD REPEATED IN AN UNSTEADY VOICE AND WITH A SUDDEN CHANGE IN HER COLOR TO PALENESS THE STRANGE QUESTION PUT TO ME BY GLOODY
5022-29411-0062 YOU ARE DECEIVED BY A FALSE FRIEND WHO LIES TO YOU AND HATES YOU THE MAN SHE WAS SPEAKING OF TURNED THE CORNER OF THE NEW COTTAGE
5022-29411-0063 IT'S TOO LATE NOW INSTEAD OF LETTING ME PRECEDE HER AS I HAD ANTICIPATED SHE RAN ON BEFORE ME MADE A SIGN TO THE DEAF MAN AS SHE PASSED HIM NOT TO STOP HER AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE OPEN DOOR OF HER FATHER'S SIDE OF THE COTTAGE
5022-29411-0065 THE FEAR OF APPEARING TO BE AFRAID AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE MADE MY EXCUSES TO MY HOST OF THE EVENING HOW WOULD MY MORAL COURAGE HAVE ANSWERED HIM IF HE HAD ASKED FOR AN EXPLANATION USELESS TO SPECULATE ON IT HAD I POSSESSED THE WISDOM OF MIDDLE LIFE
5022-29411-0066 HIS BOOK OF LEAVES WOULD NOT HAVE TOLD HIM IN MY OWN HANDWRITING THAT I BELIEVED IN HIS BETTER NATURE
5022-29411-0068 HE POINTED TO THE GRANDLY DARKENING VIEW THE TWO MEN WHO COULD HAVE PAINTED THE MYSTERY OF THOSE GROWING SHADOWS AND FADING LIGHTS LIE IN THE GRAVES OF REMBRANDT AND TURNER SHALL WE GO TO TEA ON OUR WAY TO HIS ROOM WE STOPPED AT THE MILLER'S DOOR
5022-29411-0069 WILL YOU INQUIRE HE SAID IF MISS CRISTEL IS READY I WENT IN OLD TOLLER WAS IN THE KITCHEN SMOKING HIS PIPE WITHOUT APPEARING TO ENJOY IT WHAT'S COME TO MY GIRL HE ASKED THE MOMENT HE SAW ME
5049-25947-0000 THE ROUGH RIDERS AT GUASIMAS ON THE DAY THE AMERICAN TROOPS LANDED ON THE COAST OF CUBA THE CUBANS INFORMED GENERAL WHEELER
5049-25947-0001 BLOCKING THE WAY TO SANTIAGO
5049-25947-0003 GENERAL WHEELER GUIDED BY THE CUBANS RECONNOITRED THIS TRAIL ON THE TWENTY THIRD OF JUNE AND WITH THE POSITION OF THE ENEMY FULLY EXPLAINED TO HIM RETURNED TO SIBONEY AND INFORMED GENERAL YOUNG AND COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0004 THAT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WOULD ATTACK THE SPANISH POSITION
5049-25947-0006 LAY THE CAMP OF THE ROUGH RIDERS AND THROUGH IT CUBAN OFFICERS WERE RIDING THEIR HALF STARVED PONIES AND SCATTERING THE ASHES OF THE CAMP FIRES
5049-25947-0007 BELOW THEM WAS THE BEACH AND THE ROARING SURF IN WHICH A THOUSAND OR SO NAKED MEN WERE ASSISTING AND IMPEDING THE PROGRESS SHOREWARD OF THEIR COMRADES IN PONTOONS AND SHORE BOATS
5049-25947-0009 OR SHOUTING WITH DELIGHT AS THEY PLUNGED INTO THE FIRST BATH THAT HAD OFFERED IN SEVEN DAYS AND THOSE IN THE LAUNCHES AS THEY WERE PITCHED HEAD FIRST AT THE SOIL OF CUBA SIGNALIZED THEIR ARRIVAL BY HOWLS OF TRIUMPH
5049-25947-0010 ON EITHER SIDE ROSE BLACK OVERHANGING RIDGES
5049-25947-0012 THE ROUGH RIDERS LEFT CAMP AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HALF A DOZEN OFFICERS THEY WERE DISMOUNTED AND CARRIED THEIR BLANKET ROLLS HAVERSACKS AMMUNITION AND CARBINES
5049-25947-0013 ALONG THE TRAIL TO THE WEST WHICH WAS ON HIGH GROUND AND A HALF MILE TO A MILE DISTANT FROM THE TRAIL ALONG WHICH GENERAL YOUNG AND HIS REGULARS WERE MARCHING
5049-25947-0015 TO DISTINGUISH THE OTHER COLUMN AS SOON AS THE ROUGH RIDERS HAD REACHED THE TOP OF THE RIDGE NOT TWENTY MINUTES AFTER THEY HAD LEFT CAMP WHICH WAS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTED ITSELF COLONEL WOOD ORDERED CAPTAIN CAPRON
5049-25947-0016 NO FLANKERS WERE PLACED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DENSE UNDERGROWTH AND THE TANGLE OF VINES THAT STRETCHED FROM THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES TO THE BUSHES BELOW MADE IT A PHYSICAL IMPOSSIBILITY
5049-25947-0018 WE ADVANCED TALKING IN THAT FASHION AND IN HIGH SPIRITS AND CONGRATULATING OURSELVES IN BEING SHUT OF THE TRANSPORT AND ON BREATHING FINE MOUNTAIN AIR AGAIN
5049-25947-0019 WE HAD BEEN RIDING IN THIS PLEASANT FASHION FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH BRIEF HALTS FOR REST WHEN WOOD STOPPED THE HEAD OF THE COLUMN AND RODE DOWN THE TRAIL TO MEET CAPRON WHO WAS COMING BACK
5049-25947-0021 IT SHUT OFF FIELDS OF HIGH GRASS BLOCKED AT EVERY FIFTY YARDS WITH GREAT BARRICADES OF UNDERGROWTH AND TANGLED TREES AND CHAPPARAL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0022 THERE WAS NOT A FOOT OF FREE GROUND THE BUSHES SEEMED ABSOLUTELY IMPENETRABLE AS INDEED THEY WERE LATER FOUND TO BE WHEN WE HALTED THE MEN SAT
5049-25947-0024 AT THE READY PEERING INTO THE BUSHES WE MUST HAVE WAITED THERE WHILE WOOD RECONNOITRED FOR OVER TEN MINUTES THEN HE RETURNED AND BEGAN DEPLOYING HIS TROOPS OUT AT EITHER SIDE OF THE TRAIL
5049-25947-0025 G TROOP WAS ORDERED TO BEAT INTO THE BUSHES ON THE RIGHT AND K AND A WERE SENT OVER THE RIDGE ON WHICH WE STOOD DOWN INTO THE HOLLOW TO CONNECT WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
5049-25947-0027 ACTING ON A FALSE ALARM AND THAT THERE WERE NO SPANIARDS AHEAD OF US I GUESSED IT WAS CAPRON'S MEN FIRING AT RANDOM TO DISCLOSE THE ENEMY'S POSITION I RAN AFTER G TROOP UNDER CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN AND FOUND
5049-25947-0028 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE THICKET AT ONE MOMENT THE UNDERBRUSH SEEMED SWARMING WITH OUR MEN AND THE NEXT EXCEPT THAT YOU HEARD THE TWIGS BREAKING AND HEAVY BREATHING OR A CRASH AS A VINE PULLED SOME ONE DOWN
5049-25947-0030 AND SO HOT THAT OUR MEN COULD ONLY LIE FLAT IN THE GRASS AND RETURN IT IN THAT POSITION IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT OUR MEN BELIEVED THEY WERE BEING
5049-25947-0031 WHICH THEY IMAGINED MUST HAVE SWUNG TO THE RIGHT AND HAVING LOST ITS BEARINGS AND HEARING THEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH HAD MISTAKEN THEM FOR THE ENEMY THEY ACCORDINGLY CEASED FIRING AND BEGAN SHOUTING
5049-25947-0033 CAPRON COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE FIRED INTO US AT ANY TIME UNLESS HE HAD TURNED DIRECTLY AROUND IN HIS TRACKS AND AIMED UP THE VERY TRAIL HE HAD JUST DESCENDED
5049-25947-0034 THEY COULD NOT SEE TWENTY FEET ON THREE SIDES OF THEM BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND LAY THE VALLEY AND ACROSS IT CAME THE SOUND OF YOUNG'S BRIGADE WHO WERE APPARENTLY HEAVILY ENGAGED
5049-25947-0036 LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT RAN UP JUST THEN BRINGING WITH HIM LIEUTENANT WOODBURY KANE AND TEN TROOPERS FROM K TROOP ROOSEVELT LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS BESIDE LLEWELLYN AND CONSULTED WITH HIM EAGERLY
5049-25947-0037 KANE WAS SMILING WITH THE CHARMING CONTENT OF A PERFECTLY HAPPY MAN WHEN CAPTAIN LLEWELLYN TOLD HIM HIS MEN WERE NOT NEEDED AND TO REJOIN HIS TROOP HE LED HIS DETAIL OVER THE EDGE OF THE HILL ON WHICH WE LAY
5049-25947-0039 DRAGGING THE WOUNDED WITH US OWING TO THE LOW AIM OF THE ENEMY WE WERE FORCED TO MOVE ON OUR KNEES AND CRAWL EVEN THEN MEN WERE HIT ONE MAN NEAR ME WAS SHOT THROUGH THE HEAD
5049-25947-0040 IT HAD BEEN ORDERED TO ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION WITH GENERAL YOUNG'S COLUMN AND WHILE ADVANCING AND FIRING ON THE RIDGE CAPTAIN JENKINS SENT
5049-25947-0042 BUT HE CONTINUED WAVING IT UNTIL THE TENTH CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALLEY ANSWERED AND THE TWO COLUMNS WERE CONNECTED BY A SKIRMISH LINE COMPOSED OF K TROOP AND A UNDER CAPTAIN BUCKY O'NEILL
5049-25947-0043 G TROOP MEANWHILE HAD HURRIED OVER TO THE LEFT AND PASSING THROUGH THE OPENING IN THE WIRE FENCE HAD SPREAD OUT INTO OPEN ORDER IT FOLLOWED DOWN AFTER CAPTAIN LUNA'S TROOP AND D AND E TROOPS
5049-25947-0045 WOOD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN ALONG IT LEADING HIS HORSE WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BE OF USE IN CASE HE HAD TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ALTER HIS ORIGINAL FORMATION
5049-25947-0046 HIS PLAN AT PRESENT WAS TO SPREAD OUT HIS MEN SO THAT THEY WOULD JOIN YOUNG ON THE RIGHT AND ON THE LEFT SWING AROUND UNTIL THEY FLANKED THE ENEMY K AND A TROOPS
5049-25947-0048 WAS NO MORE THAN A MAN COVERS IN SLIDING FOR A BASE AT OTHER TIMES HALF A TROOP WOULD RISE AND RACE FORWARD AND THEN BURROW DEEP IN THE HOT GRASS AND FIRE
5049-25947-0049 THE FIRE DISCIPLINE WAS EXCELLENT THE PROPHETS OF EVIL OF THE TAMPA BAY HOTEL HAD FORETOLD THAT THE COWBOYS WOULD SHOOT AS THEY CHOSE AND IN THE FIELD WOULD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THEIR OFFICERS
5049-25947-0051 WHICH WAS AS HOT AS A STEAM BATH AND WITH THEIR FLESH AND CLOTHING TORN BY THORNS AND THE SWORD LIKE BLADE OF THE SPANISH BAYONET THE GLARE OF THE SUN WAS FULL IN THEIR EYES AND AS FIERCE AS A LIME LIGHT
5049-25947-0052 IT HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO A DRESSING STATION AND THE WOUNDED OF G TROOP WERE LEFT THERE IN THE CARE OF THE HOSPITAL STEWARDS A TALL GAUNT YOUNG MAN WITH A CROSS ON HIS ARM WAS JUST COMING BACK UP THE TRAIL HIS HEAD WAS BENT
5049-25947-0054 BUT THEN HE WORE A CANVAS JACKET AND THE MAN HE CARRIED ON HIS SHOULDERS WAS TRYING TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM A WHITE WASHED LINE AND I RECOGNIZED THE YOUNG DOCTOR WITH THE BLOOD BATHING HIS BREECHES AS BOB CHURCH
5049-25947-0055 AND THAT SO FEW OF THEM DIED IS GREATLY DUE TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO WENT DOWN INTO THE FIRING LINE AND PULLED THEM FROM IT AND BORE THEM OUT OF DANGER
5049-25947-0057 THE WALK DOWN THAT TRAIL PRESENTED ONE OF THE MOST GREWSOME PICTURES OF THE WAR
5049-25947-0058 HAD BEEN ABANDONED ALL ALONG ITS LENGTH IT LOOKED AS THOUGH A RETREATING ARMY HAD FLED ALONG IT RATHER THAN THAT ONE TROOP HAD FOUGHT ITS WAY THROUGH IT TO THE FRONT
5049-25947-0060 LIEUTENANT THOMAS IS BADLY WOUNDED IN HERE AND WE CAN'T MOVE HIM
5049-25947-0061 SOME PLACE WHERE THERE IS SHADE AND A BREEZE
5049-25947-0063 IT GAVE ONE A THRILL OF AWE AND WONDER TO SEE HOW THESE COWBOY SURGEONS WITH A STICK THAT ONE WOULD USE TO LIGHT A PIPE AND WITH THE GAUDY KERCHIEFS THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THEIR NECKS
5049-25947-0064 YOU'RE TAKING ME TO THE FRONT AREN'T YOU YOU SAID YOU WOULD THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN DO YOU UNDERSTAND THEY'VE KILLED CAPTAIN CAPRON THE MEXICANS THEY'VE KILLED MY CAPTAIN
5049-25947-0066 GRAVE BOYISH FACES FILLED WITH SYMPATHY AND CONCERN ONLY FIFTY FEET FROM HIM AND FARTHER DOWN THE TRAIL I PASSED HIS CAPTAIN WITH HIS BODY PROPPED AGAINST CHURCH'S KNEE
5049-25947-0067 AND WITH HIS HEAD FALLEN ON THE SURGEON'S SHOULDER CAPRON WAS ALWAYS A HANDSOME SOLDIERLY LOOKING MAN
5049-25947-0069 WITH IT AND THAT THOUGH THEY MIGHT PECK AND MEND AT THE BODY HE HAD RECEIVED HIS FINAL ORDERS
5049-25947-0070 STRANGELY MEAN AND TAWDRY
5049-25947-0072 SCRIBBLED IN IT IN PENCIL
5049-25947-0073 WE ONLY MET TWO WEEKS AGO AT SAN ANTONIO BUT HE AND ME HAD GOT TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO NOW
5049-25947-0075 AND I WAS RUNNING FORWARD FEELING CONFIDENT THAT I MUST BE CLOSE ON OUR MEN WHEN I SAW THE BODY OF A SERGEANT BLOCKING THE TRAIL AND STRETCHED AT FULL LENGTH ACROSS IT
5049-25947-0076 IT WAS APPARENTLY THE BODY OF THE FIRST MAN KILLED AFTER DEATH THE BODIES OF SOME MEN SEEM TO SHRINK ALMOST INSTANTLY WITHIN THEMSELVES THEY BECOME LIMP AND SHAPELESS
5049-25947-0078 I BORROWED A CARBINE FROM A WOUNDED MAN AND JOINED THE REMNANT OF L TROOP WHICH WAS CLOSE TO THE TRAIL THIS TROOP WAS THEN COMMANDED BY SECOND LIEUTENANT DAY WHO ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONDUCT THAT MORNING
5049-25947-0079 AND AT THE BATTLE OF SAN JUAN LATER WHEN HE WAS SHOT THROUGH THE ARM WAS PROMOTED TO BE CAPTAIN OF L TROOP OR AS IT WAS LATER OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED CAPRON'S TROOP HE WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE LINE AS UNCONCERNEDLY
5049-25947-0081 BYRNE WAS THE ONLY MAN I NOTICED WHO SEEMED TO REGARD THE FIGHT AS IN ANY WAY HUMOROUS
5049-25947-0082 THE CONDITIONS WERE EXCEPTIONAL
5049-25947-0084 FOR THEIR ARMS HAD BEEN ISSUED TO THEM SO SOON BEFORE SAILING THAT THEY HAD ONLY DRILLED WITH THEM WITHOUT USING CARTRIDGES TO THIS HANDICAP WAS ALSO ADDED THE NATURE OF THE GROUND
5049-25947-0085 AND THE FACT THAT OUR MEN COULD NOT SEE THEIR OPPONENTS THEIR OWN MEN FELL OR ROLLED OVER ON EVERY SIDE SHOT DOWN BY AN INVISIBLE ENEMY WITH NO ONE UPON WHOM THEY COULD RETALIATE
5049-25947-0087 AND SECURING ITS COVER FOR THEMSELVES AND ANSWERING EACH VOLLEY WITH ONE THAT SOUNDED LIKE AN ECHO OF THE FIRST THE MEN WERE PANTING FOR BREATH THE SWEAT RAN SO READILY INTO THEIR EYES THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE SIGHTS OF THEIR GUNS
5049-25947-0088 THEIR LIMBS UNUSED TO SUCH EXERTION AFTER SEVEN DAYS OF CRAMPED IDLENESS ON THE TROOP SHIP TREMBLED WITH WEAKNESS AND THE SUN BLINDED
5049-25947-0090 AND PASSING THROUGH A SUCCESSION OF CONVULSIONS HE NEVERTHELESS IN HIS BRIEF MOMENTS OF COMPARATIVE PEACE BORE HIMSELF WITH THE UTMOST CALM
5049-25947-0091 A SOLDIER TO DUTY THAT HE CONTINUED WRITING HIS ACCOUNT OF THE FIGHT
5049-25947-0093 FOR AGUARDIENTE AND WAS NOW OCCUPIED IN FORCE BY THE ENEMY LIEUTENANT COLONEL ROOSEVELT ON THE FAR LEFT WAS MOVING UP HIS MEN WITH THE INTENTION OF TAKING THIS HOUSE ON THE FLANK
5049-25947-0094 WOOD WHO WAS ALL OVER THE LINE HAD THE SAME OBJECTIVE POINT IN HIS MIND THE TROOP COMMANDERS HAD A GENERAL IDEA THAT THE DISTILLERY WAS THE KEY TO THE ENEMY'S POSITION AND WERE ALL WORKING IN THAT DIRECTION
5049-25947-0096 I DO NOT SUPPOSE WOOD OUT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED ENGAGED SAW MORE THAN THIRTY OF HIS MEN
5049-25947-0097 SO EXCELLENT WAS THE INTELLIGENCE OF THE OFFICERS AND SO READY THE SPIRIT OF THE MEN THAT THEY KEPT AN ALMOST PERFECT ALIGNMENT AS WAS SHOWN WHEN THE FINAL ORDER CAME TO CHARGE IN THE OPEN FIELDS
5049-25947-0099 AND RAN FOR THE COVER THEY WERE DIRECTED TO TAKE LIKE MEN TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE RAIN AND FELL PANTING ON THEIR FACES WHILE THE WESTERN TRAPPERS AND HUNTERS SLIPPED AND WRIGGLED THROUGH THE GRASS LIKE INDIANS
5049-25947-0100 DODGING FROM TREE TRUNK TO TREE TRUNK AND FROM ONE BUSH TO ANOTHER THEY FELL INTO LINE AT THE SAME TIME WITH THE OTHERS BUT WHILE DOING SO THEY HAD NOT ONCE EXPOSED THEMSELVES
5049-25947-0102 AND ROOSEVELT WAS SO CLOSE TO ONE BULLET WHEN IT STRUCK A TREE THAT IT FILLED HIS EYES AND EARS WITH TINY SPLINTERS MAJOR BRODIE AND LIEUTENANT THOMAS WERE BOTH WOUNDED WITHIN A FEW FEET OF COLONEL WOOD
5049-25947-0103 AT SIBONEY ROWLAND SAT STILL FOR A SHORT TIME
5049-25947-0105 A DISTANCE OF SIX MILES AND UPHILL ALL THE WAY CARRYING HIS CARBINE CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN HOSPITAL WOOD SAID I WAS ROWLAND ANSWERED SHEEPISHLY
5049-25947-0106 WHEN SHOT THROUGH THE BODY ASKED TO BE PROPPED UP AGAINST A TREE WITH HIS CANTEEN AND CARTRIDGE BELT BESIDE HIM AND THE LAST HIS TROOP SAW OF HIM HE WAS SEATED ALONE GRIMLY FIRING OVER THEIR HEADS
5049-25947-0108 THE ENTRANCE TO HIS WOUND WAS SO SMALL THAT CHURCH COULD NOT INSERT ENOUGH OF THE GAUZE PACKING TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO MAKE THIS HOLE LARGER HE SAID TO THE BOY OR YOU'LL BLEED TO DEATH
5049-25947-0109 CAN YOU STAND BEING CARRIED DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CARRY ME THE TROOPER ASKED YES WELL EXCLAIMED THE BOY ADMIRINGLY YOU CERTAINLY KNOW YOUR BUSINESS
5049-25947-0111 OR OF BEING CARRIED A DAY LATER ON A LITTER
5049-25947-0112 YOU CAN START AT ONCE BUT IF YOU WAIT UNTIL TO MORROW WHEN I CAN SPARE THE MEN YOU CAN BE CARRIED ALL THE WAY
5049-25947-0114 THE FIRING FROM THE ENEMY SOUNDED LESS NEAR AND THE BULLETS PASSED MUCH HIGHER ROOSEVELT WHO HAD PICKED UP A CARBINE AND WAS FIRING TO GIVE THE DIRECTION TO THE OTHERS DETERMINED UPON A CHARGE
5049-25947-0115 WOOD AT THE OTHER END OF THE LINE DECIDED AT THE SAME TIME UPON THE SAME MANOEUVRE IT WAS CALLED WOOD'S BLUFF AFTERWARD FOR HE HAD NOTHING TO BACK IT WITH
5049-25947-0117 AND FROM BEHIND TREES AND CAME CHEERING OUT INTO THE HOT SUNLIGHT WAS THE ENTIRE FIGHTING FORCE AGAINST IT THEY SUPPOSED THE REGIMENT WAS COMING CLOSE ON ITS HEELS
5049-25947-0118 AND AS SPANISH TROOPS HATE BEING RUSHED AS A CAT HATES WATER THEY FIRED A FEW PARTING VOLLEYS AND BROKE AND RAN THE CHEERING HAD THE SAME INVIGORATING EFFECT ON OUR OWN SIDE AS A COLD SHOWER
5049-25947-0120 WHEN WE FIRED A VOLLEY ONE OF THE PRISONERS SAID LATER INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK THEY CAME FORWARD THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO FIGHT TO COME CLOSER AT EVERY VOLLEY
5049-25947-0121 WHERE HE ANNOUNCED HE HAD BEEN ATTACKED BY THE ENTIRE AMERICAN ARMY ONE OF THE RESIDENTS OF SANTIAGO ASKED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IF THOSE AMERICANS FOUGHT WELL WELL HE REPLIED
5049-25947-0123 AS IT WAS OWING TO COLONEL WOOD'S CHARGE WHICH TOOK THE SPANIARDS IN FLANK THAT GENERAL WHEELER AND GENERAL YOUNG WERE ABLE TO ADVANCE
5049-25947-0124 OVER FOUR TIMES THEIR OWN NUMBER INTRENCHED BEHIND RIFLE PITS AND BUSHES IN A MOUNTAIN PASS IN SPITE OF THE SMOKELESS POWDER USED BY THE SPANIARDS
5049-25947-0126 THE EAGER SPIRIT IN WHICH THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED IS BEST DESCRIBED IN THE SPANISH SOLDIER'S ANSWER TO THE INQUIRING CIVILIAN THEY TRIED TO CATCH US WITH THEIR HANDS
5104-33406-0000 ALL THE FREEMEN IN THE WEST OF ICELAND HAD COME TO A MEETING HERE THEY MADE LAWS AND PUNISHED MEN FOR HAVING DONE WRONG THE MEETING WAS OVER NOW MEN WERE WALKING ABOUT THE PLAIN AND TALKING EVERYBODY SEEMED MUCH EXCITED
5104-33406-0002 NO NO SAID ANOTHER ERIC IS A BLOODY MAN I AM GLAD HE IS OUT OF ICELAND JUST THEN A BIG MAN WITH BUSHY RED HAIR AND BEARD STALKED THROUGH THE CROWD HE LOOKED STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SCOWLED
5104-33406-0003 THERE HE GOES PEOPLE SAID AND TURNED TO LOOK AFTER HIM HIS HANDS ARE AS RED AS HIS BEARD SOME SAID AND FROWNED BUT OTHERS LOOKED AT HIM AND SMILED SAYING HE WALKS LIKE THOR THE FEARLESS
5104-33406-0005 THOSE LITTLE ISLANDS OFF THE SHORE OF ICELAND OUTLAWED FROM ALL OF THEM ON ACCOUNT OF HIS QUARRELS WHERE WILL HE GO NOW I WONDER THIS ERIC STRODE DOWN TO THE SHORE WITH HIS MEN FOLLOWING HE IS IN A BLACK TEMPER THEY SAID
5104-33406-0006 WE SHOULD BEST NOT TALK TO HIM SO THEY MADE READY THE BOAT IN SILENCE ERIC GOT INTO THE PILOT'S SEAT AND THEY SAILED OFF SOON THEY PULLED THE SHIP UP ON THEIR OWN SHORE
5104-33406-0008 AND THERE IS ALWAYS A STORM ABOUT ME IT IS MY SWORD'S FAULT
5104-33406-0009 SHE HAS SHUT NORWAY TO ME AND NOW ICELAND WHERE WILL YOU GO NEXT OLD COMRADE AND HE PULLED OUT HIS SWORD AND LOOKED AT IT AND SMILED AS THE FIRE FLASHED ON IT
5104-33406-0011 OUR SWORDS ARE SISTERS IN BLOOD AND WE ARE BROTHERS IN ADVENTURE DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN MY HEART TO DO HE JUMPED TO HIS FEET AND HIS FACE GLOWED THEN HE LAUGHED AS HE LOOKED AT HIS MEN
5104-33406-0012 I SEE THE ANSWER FLASHING FROM YOUR EYES HE SAID
5104-33406-0014 ERIC LAUGHED DID YOU EVER HEAR THAT STORY THAT GUNNBIORN TOLD
5104-33406-0015 WHILE HE DRIFTED ABOUT HE SAW A STRANGE LAND THAT ROSE UP WHITE AND SHINING OUT OF A BLUE SEA HUGE SHIPS OF ICE SAILED OUT FROM IT AND MET HIM I MEAN TO SAIL TO THAT LAND
5104-33406-0017 FOR HE LOVES YOU HUNTED LIKE A WOLF FROM CORNER TO CORNER OF THE WORLD ERIC CRIED ANGRILY WILL THEY NOT EVEN LET ME FINISH ONE FEAST THEN HE LAUGHED
5104-33406-0018 BUT IF I TAKE MY SPORT LIKE A WOLF I MUST BE HUNTED LIKE ONE
5104-33406-0020 CAN NO BAD FORTUNE SPOIL YOUR GOOD NATURE LAUGHED ERIC BUT NOW WE ARE OFF LET EVERY MAN CARRY WHAT HE CAN SO THEY QUICKLY LOADED THEMSELVES WITH CLOTHES AND GOLD AND SWORDS AND SPEARS AND KETTLES OF FOOD
5104-33406-0021 ERIC LED HIS WIFE THORHILD AND HIS TWO YOUNG SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF
5104-33406-0023 THORGEST IS OFF COME TO MY HOUSE FOR A FEAST ALL THIS TIME THEY WERE MAKING READY FOR THE VOYAGE REPAIRING THE SHIP AND FILLING IT WITH STORES WORD OF WHAT ERIC MEANT TO DO GOT OUT AND MEN LAUGHED AND SAID IS THAT NOT LIKE ERIC
5104-33406-0024 WHAT WILL HE NOT DO SOME MEN LIKED THE SOUND OF IT AND THEY CAME TO ERIC AND SAID WE WILL GO WITH YOU TO THIS STRANGE LAND SO ALL WERE READY AND THEY PUSHED OFF WITH ERIC'S FAMILY ABOARD AND THOSE FRIENDS WHO HAD JOINED HIM
5104-33406-0026 WE SHALL SURELY FIND SOMETHING I DO NOT KNOW EITHER HOW LONG WE MUST GO SO THEY SAILED THAT STRANGE OCEAN NEVER DREAMING WHAT MIGHT BE AHEAD OF THEM THEY FOUND NO ISLANDS TO REST ON THEY MET HEAVY FOGS
5104-33406-0027 ONE DAY AS ERIC SAT IN THE PILOT'S SEAT HE SAID I THINK THAT I SEE ONE OF GUNNBIORN'S SHIPS OF ICE SHALL WE SAIL UP TO HER AND SEE WHAT KIND OF A CRAFT SHE IS YES SHOUTED HIS MEN
5104-33406-0029 IT MUST BE GIANTS THAT SAIL IN IT FROST GIANTS SAID ANOTHER OF THE MEN BUT AS THEY CAME NEARER
5104-33406-0030 BY THOR THAT GUNNBIORN WAS A FOOLISH FELLOW WHY LOOK IT IS ONLY A PIECE OF FLOATING ICE SUCH AS WE SOMETIMES SEE FROM ICELAND IT IS NO SHIP AND THERE IS NO ONE ON IT
5104-33406-0032 YONDER IS A STRANGE PILOT ERIC LAUGHED I HAVE SEEN BEARS COME FLOATING SO TO THE NORTH SHORE OF ICELAND AN OLD MAN SAID PERHAPS THEY COME FROM THE LAND THAT WE ARE GOING TO FIND ONE DAY ERIC SAID
5104-33406-0033 IT IS CARRYING OUR SHIP AWAY FROM THIS LAND I CANNOT MAKE HEAD AGAINST IT OUT WITH THE OARS SO WITH OARS AND SAIL AND RUDDER THEY FOUGHT AGAINST THE CURRENT BUT IT TOOK THE BOAT ALONG LIKE A CHIP AND AFTER A WHILE THEY PUT UP THEIR OARS AND DRIFTED
5104-33406-0035 PERHAPS THIS RIVER WILL CARRY US TO A WHIRLPOOL AND SUCK US UNDER THE MEN SAID BUT AT LAST ERIC FELT THE CURRENT LESS STRONG UNDER HIS HAND TO THE OARS AGAIN HE CALLED
5104-33406-0036 BUT WHEN THEY REACHED THE SHORE THEY FOUND NO PLACE TO GO IN STEEP BLACK WALLS SHOT UP FROM THE SEA NOTHING GREW ON THEM WHEN THE MEN LOOKED ABOVE THE CLIFFS THEY SAW A LONG LINE OF WHITE CUTTING THE SKY IT IS A LAND OF ICE
5104-33406-0038 AFTER A WHILE THEY BEGAN TO SEE SMALL BAYS CUT INTO THE SHORE WITH LITTLE FLAT PATCHES OF GREEN AT THEIR SIDES THEY LANDED IN THESE PLACES AND STRETCHED AND WARMED THEMSELVES AND ATE BUT THESE SPOTS ARE ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR GRAVES
5104-33406-0039 THE MEN SAID WE CAN NOT LIVE HERE SO THEY WENT ON AGAIN ALL THE TIME THE WEATHER WAS GROWING COLDER ERIC'S PEOPLE KEPT THEMSELVES WRAPPED IN THEIR CLOAKS AND PUT SCARFS AROUND THEIR HEADS AND IT IS STILL SUMMER THORHILD SAID
5104-33406-0041 THEY MADE A HOUSE OUT OF STONES FOR THERE WERE MANY IN THAT PLACE THEY LIVED THERE THAT WINTER THE SEA FOR A LONG WAY OUT FROM SHORE FROZE SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE WHITE LAND THE MEN WENT OUT UPON IT TO HUNT WHITE BEAR AND SEAL
5104-33406-0042 THEY ATE THE MEAT AND WORE THE SKINS TO KEEP THEM WARM THE HARDEST THING WAS TO GET FUEL FOR THE FIRE NO TREES GREW THERE THE MEN FOUND A LITTLE DRIFTWOOD ALONG THE SHORE
5104-33406-0044 AND ALL THE TIME I HEAR GREAT NOISES AS THOUGH SOME GIANT WERE BREAKING THIS LAND INTO PIECES AH CHEER UP GOOD WIFE ERIC LAUGHED I SMELL BETTER LUCK AHEAD
5104-33406-0045 ONCE ERIC AND HIS MEN CLIMBED THE CLIFFS AND WENT BACK INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE LAND WHEN THEY CAME HOME THEY HAD THIS TO TELL IT IS A COUNTRY OF ICE SHINING WHITE NOTHING GROWS ON IT BUT A FEW MOSSES
5104-33406-0047 SOMETIMES THE SUN SHOWED FOR AN HOUR SOMETIMES FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES SOMETIMES IT DID NOT SHOW AT ALL FOR A WEEK THE MEN HUNTED BY THE BRIGHT SHINING OF THE MOON OR BY THE NORTHERN LIGHTS AS IT GREW WARMER
5104-33406-0048 THE ICE IN THE SEA BEGAN TO CRACK AND MOVE AND MELT AND FLOAT AWAY ERIC WAITED ONLY UNTIL THERE WAS A CLEAR PASSAGE IN THE WATER THEN HE LAUNCHED HIS BOAT AND THEY SAILED SOUTHWARD AGAIN AT LAST THEY FOUND A PLACE THAT ERIC LIKED
5104-33406-0050 I AM HUNGRY TO KNOW WHAT IS THERE THEN THEY ALL GOT INTO THE BOAT AGAIN AND SAILED NORTH WE CAN LEAVE NO ONE HERE ERIC HAD SAID WE CANNOT TELL WHAT MIGHT COME BETWEEN US PERHAPS GIANTS OR DRAGONS
5104-33406-0051 OR STRANGE MEN MIGHT COME OUT OF THIS INLAND ICE AND KILL OUR PEOPLE WE MUST STAY TOGETHER FARTHER NORTH THEY FOUND ONLY THE SAME BARE FROZEN COUNTRY SO AFTER A WHILE THEY SAILED BACK TO THEIR HOME AND LIVED THERE
5104-33406-0053 IS DRY FOR MEAD THIS IS A BARE AND COLD AND HUNGRY LAND I WILL VISIT MY FRIENDS IN ICELAND AND OUR SWORDS ARE RUSTY WITH LONG RESTING SAID HIS MEN PERHAPS WE CAN FIND PLAY FOR THEM IN ICELAND
5104-33406-0054 NOW I HAVE A PLAN ERIC SUDDENLY SAID WOULD IT NOT BE PLEASANT TO SEE OTHER FEAST HALLS AS WE SAIL ALONG THE COAST OH IT WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT HIS MEN SAID WELL SAID ERIC
5104-33406-0056 IT IS BETTER THAN ICELAND SO ERIC AND ALL HIS PEOPLE SAILED BACK AND SPENT THE WINTER WITH HIS FRIENDS AH ERIC IT IS GOOD TO HEAR YOUR LAUGH AGAIN THEY SAID ERIC WAS AT MANY FEASTS AND SAW MANY MEN AND HE TALKED MUCH OF HIS GREENLAND
5104-33406-0057 THE SEA IS FULL OF WHALE AND SEALS AND GREAT FISH HE SAID THE LAND HAS BEAR AND REINDEER THERE ARE NO MEN THERE COME BACK WITH ME AND CHOOSE YOUR LAND
5104-33406-0059 AND WANTED TO BE HIS NEIGHBORS SO THE NEXT SUMMER THIRTY FIVE SHIPS FULL OF MEN AND WOMEN AND GOODS FOLLOWED ERIC FOR GREENLAND BUT THEY MET HEAVY STORMS AND SOME SHIPS WERE WRECKED AND THE MEN DROWNED
5104-33406-0060 OTHER MEN GREW HEARTSICK AT THE TERRIBLE STORM AND THE LONG VOYAGE AND NO SIGHT OF LAND AND THEY TURNED BACK TO ICELAND SO OF THOSE THIRTY FIVE SHIPS ONLY FIFTEEN GOT TO GREENLAND
5104-33407-0000 NOW ERIC HAD LIVED IN GREENLAND FOR FIFTEEN YEARS HIS SONS THORSTEIN AND LEIF HAD GROWN UP TO BE BIG STRONG MEN ONE SPRING LEIF SAID TO HIS FATHER I HAVE NEVER SEEN NORWAY OUR MOTHER LAND
5104-33407-0001 I LONG TO GO THERE AND MEET THE GREAT MEN AND SEE THE PLACES THAT SKALDS SING ABOUT ERIC ANSWERED IT IS RIGHT THAT YOU SHOULD GO NO MAN HAS REALLY LIVED UNTIL HE HAS SEEN NORWAY
5104-33407-0003 AND EVERYWHERE MEN RECEIVED HIM GLADLY FOR HE WAS HANDSOME AND WISE BUT AT LAST HE CAME NEAR NORWAY THEN HE STOOD UP BEFORE THE PILOT'S SEAT AND SANG LOUDLY
5104-33407-0004 IN THE SKY ABOVE I SEE FAIR ASGARD'S SHINING ROOFS THE FLYING HAIR OF THOR THE WINGS OF ODIN'S BIRDS THE ROAD THAT HEROES TREAD I AM HERE IN THE LAND OF THE GODS THE LAND OF MIGHTY MEN
5104-33407-0006 I WILL GO TO THE KING HE SAID HE HAD NEVER SEEN A KING THERE WERE NO KINGS IN ICELAND OR IN GREENLAND SO HE WENT TO THE CITY WHERE THE KING HAD HIS FINE HOUSE THE KING'S NAME WAS OLAF
5104-33407-0007 HE WAS A GREAT GRANDSON OF HARALD HAIRFAIR FOR HARALD HAD BEEN DEAD A HUNDRED YEARS NOW THE KING WAS GOING TO HOLD A FEAST AT NIGHT AND LEIF PUT ON HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES TO GO TO IT
5104-33407-0009 LINED WITH SEAL FUR HIS LONG SWORD STUCK OUT FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK ON HIS HEAD HE PUT A KNITTED CAP OF BRIGHT COLORS THEN HE WALKED TO THE KING'S FEAST HALL AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR
5104-33407-0010 IT WAS A GREAT HALL AND IT WAS FULL OF RICHLY DRESSED MEN THE FIRES SHONE ON SO MANY GOLDEN HEAD BANDS AND BRACELETS AND SO MANY GLITTERING SWORDS AND SPEARS ON THE WALL AND THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE OF TALKING AND LAUGHING
5104-33407-0012 HE WAS KEEN EYED AND SOON SAW LEIF IN HIS FAR SEAT YONDER IS SOME MAN OF MARK HE SAID TO HIMSELF HE IS SURELY WORTH KNOWING HIS FACE IS NOT THE FACE OF A FOOL
5104-33407-0013 HE CARRIES HIS HEAD LIKE A LORD OF MEN HE SENT A THRALL AND ASKED LEIF TO COME TO HIM SO LEIF WALKED DOWN THE LONG HALL AND STOOD BEFORE THE KING I AM GLAD TO HAVE YOU FOR A GUEST THE KING SAID
5104-33407-0015 MANY COME TO NORWAY TO TRADE BUT THEY SELDOM COME TO THE KING'S HALL I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR LAND COME UP AND SPEAK WITH ME SO LEIF WENT UP THE STEPS OF THE HIGH SEAT AND SAT DOWN BY THE KING AND TALKED WITH HIM
5104-33407-0016 WHEN THE FEAST WAS OVER THE KING SAID YOU SHALL LIVE AT MY COURT THIS WINTER LEIF ERICSSON YOU ARE A WELCOME GUEST SO LEIF STAYED THERE THAT WINTER WHEN HE STARTED BACK IN THE SPRING
5104-33407-0018 THEN GREAT WINDS CAME OUT OF THE NORTH AND TOSSED HIS SHIP ABOUT SO THAT THE MEN COULD DO NOTHING THEY WERE BLOWN SOUTH FOR DAYS AND DAYS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHERE THEY WERE THEN THEY SAW LAND AND LEIF SAID
5104-33407-0019 SURELY LUCK HAS BROUGHT US ALSO TO A NEW COUNTRY
5104-33407-0021 WHEN THEY LANDED THEY THREW THEMSELVES UPON THE GROUND I NEVER LAY ON A BED SO SOFT AS THIS GRASS ONE SAID TALLER TREES DO NOT GROW IN NORWAY SAID ANOTHER
5104-33407-0022 THERE IS NO STONE HERE AS IN NORWAY BUT ONLY GOOD BLACK DIRT LEIF SAID I NEVER SAW SO FERTILE A LAND BEFORE THE MEN WERE HUNGRY AND SET ABOUT BUILDING A FIRE THERE IS NO LACK OF FUEL HERE
5104-33407-0024 HE HAD LIVED WITH ERIC FOR MANY YEARS AND HAD TAKEN CARE OF LEIF WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BOY SO LEIF LOVED HIM NOW ONE DAY THEY HAD BEEN WANDERING ABOUT AND ALL CAME BACK TO CAMP AT NIGHT EXCEPT TYRKER WHEN LEIF LOOKED AROUND ON HIS COMRADES HE SAID
5104-33407-0025 WHERE IS TYRKER NO ONE KNEW THEN LEIF WAS ANGRY IS A MAN OF SO LITTLE VALUE IN THIS EMPTY LAND THAT YOU WOULD LOSE ONE HE SAID WHY DID YOU NOT KEEP TOGETHER DID YOU NOT SEE THAT HE WAS GONE
5104-33407-0027 AGAIN LEIF ASKED HIS QUESTION AND PUT HIS HAND ON TYRKER'S SHOULDER AS THOUGH HE WOULD SHAKE HIM THEN TYRKER ANSWERED IN THE LANGUAGE OF ICELAND I HAVE NOT BEEN SO VERY FAR BUT I HAVE FOUND SOMETHING WONDERFUL WHAT IS IT
5104-33407-0028 CRIED THE MEN I HAVE FOUND GRAPES GROWING WILD ANSWERED TYRKER AND HE LAUGHED AND HIS EYES SHONE IT CANNOT BE LEIF SAID GRAPES DO NOT GROW IN GREENLAND NOR IN ICELAND NOR EVEN IN NORWAY
5104-33407-0030 IT IS WONDERFUL LEIF SAID I HAVE HEARD TRAVELERS TELL OF SEEING GRAPES GROWING BUT I MYSELF NEVER SAW IT YOU SHALL TAKE US TO THEM EARLY IN THE MORNING TYRKER SO IN THE MORNING THEY WENT BACK INTO THE WOODS AND SAW THE GRAPES
5104-33407-0031 THEY ATE OF THEM THEY ARE LIKE FOOD AND DRINK THEY CRIED THAT DAY LEIF SAID WE SPENT MOST OF THE SUMMER ON THE OCEAN WINTER WILL SOON BE COMING ON AND THE SEA ABOUT GREENLAND WILL BE FROZEN WE MUST START BACK
5104-33407-0033 NOW HALF OF YOU SHALL GATHER GRAPES FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THE OTHER HALF SHALL CUT TIMBER SO THEY DID AND AFTER A WEEK SAILED OFF THE SHIP WAS FULL OF LUMBER AND THEY TOWED THE ROWBOAT LOADED WITH GRAPES
5104-33407-0034 AS THEY LOOKED BACK AT THE SHORE LEIF SAID I WILL CALL THIS COUNTRY WINELAND FOR THE GRAPES THAT GROW THERE ONE OF THE MEN LEAPED UPON THE GUNWALE AND LEANED OUT CLINGING TO THE SAIL AND SANG
5104-33407-0036 THEN ALL THE MEN WAVED THEIR HANDS TO THE SHORE AND GAVE A GREAT SHOUT FOR THAT GOOD LAND FOR ALL THAT VOYAGE THEY HAD FAIR WEATHER AND SAILED INTO ERIC'S HARBOR BEFORE THE WINTER CAME
5104-33407-0037 ERIC SAW THE SHIP AND RAN DOWN TO THE SHORE HE TOOK LEIF INTO HIS ARMS AND SAID OH MY SON MY OLD EYES ACHED TO SEE YOU I HUNGER TO HEAR OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN AND DONE
5104-33407-0039 THEN THEY SAW THE GRAPES AND TASTED THEM SURELY YOU MUST HAVE PLUNDERED ASGARD THEY SAID SMACKING THEIR LIPS AT THE FEAST THAT NIGHT ERIC SAID LEIF SHALL SIT IN THE PLACE OF HONOR
5104-33407-0040 SO LEIF SAT IN THE HIGH SEAT OPPOSITE ERIC ALL MEN THOUGHT HIM A HANDSOME AND WISE MAN HE TOLD THEM OF THE STORM AND OF WINELAND NO MAN WOULD EVER NEED A CLOAK THERE THE SOIL IS RICHER THAN THE SOIL OF NORWAY
5104-33407-0042 LEIF NOTICED TWO STRANGERS AN OLD MAN WHO SAT AT ERIC'S SIDE AND A YOUNG WOMAN ON THE CROSS BENCH HE TURNED TO HIS BROTHER THORSTEIN WHO SAT NEXT TO HIM WHO ARE THESE STRANGERS HE ASKED
5104-33407-0043 THORBIORN AND HIS DAUGHTER GUDRID THORSTEIN ANSWERED THEY LANDED HERE THIS SPRING I NEVER SAW OUR FATHER MORE GLAD OF ANYTHING THAN TO SEE THIS THORBIORN THEY WERE FRIENDS BEFORE WE LEFT ICELAND
5104-33407-0045 AND THORBIORN HIMSELF WAS RICH WHEN OUR FATHER KNEW HIM AND WAS MUCH HONORED BY ALL MEN BUT ILL LUCK CAME AND HE GREW POOR THIS HURT HIS PRIDE I WILL NOT STAY IN ICELAND AND BE A BEGGAR
5104-33407-0046 HE SAID TO HIMSELF I WILL NOT HAVE MEN LOOK AT ME AND SAY HE IS NOT WHAT HIS FATHER WAS I WILL GO TO MY FRIEND ERIC THE RED IN GREENLAND THEN HE GOT READY A GREAT FEAST AND INVITED ALL HIS FRIENDS
5104-33407-0048 AFTER THAT HE SET OUT AND CAME TO GREENLAND IS NOT GUDRID BEAUTIFUL AND SHE IS WISE I MEAN TO MARRY HER IF HER FATHER WILL PERMIT IT
5104-33407-0049 NOW LEIF SETTLED DOWN IN GREENLAND AND BECAME A GREAT MAN THERE HE WAS SO BUSY AND HE GREW SO RICH THAT HE DID NOT THINK OF GOING TO WINELAND AGAIN BUT PEOPLE COULD NOT FORGET HIS STORY

5163-18515-0046 THERE SAT PHRONSIE ON A GRASSY BANK A LITTLE ABOVE THEM WITH ONE OF THE FATTEST MARKEN BABIES IN HER LAP A VARIEGATED GROUP OF NATIVES WAS NEAR BY WATCHING HER INTENTLY
5163-18515-0047 SIGHED PHRONSIE GIVING MOTHERLY PATS TO THE STOUT LITTLE LEGS DANGLING DOWN FROM HER LAP COME CHILDREN GRANDPAPA EMERGED FROM THE LITTLE OLD HOUSE WE MUST HURRY ON ELSE WE SHA'N'T GET THROUGH THIS ISLAND COME PHRONSIE GOODNESS ME

5163-39921-0001 BUT WITH A SMART ENERGETIC WAY MISTER BAXTER APPROVED OF HER HE LIKED HER STYLE AS HE WOULD HAVE SAID THE SUMMER TERM HAD JUST OPENED IN THE MAITLAND DISTRICT ESTHER MAXWELL WAS A STRANGER
5163-39921-0002 BUT SHE WAS A CAPABLE GIRL AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HER OWN ABILITY TO GET AND KEEP THE SCHOOL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER SHE SMILED BRIGHTLY AT MISTER BAXTER VERY WELL FOR A BEGINNING THE CHILDREN SEEM BRIGHT AND TEACHABLE
5163-39921-0004 WELL MISS MAXWELL I THINK IT ONLY FAIR TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THOSE BOYS WHEN THEY DO COME FOREWARNED IS FOREARMED YOU KNOW MISTER CROPPER WAS OPPOSED TO OUR HIRING YOU
5163-39921-0005 NOT OF COURSE THAT HE HAD ANY PERSONAL OBJECTION TO YOU BUT HE IS SET AGAINST FEMALE TEACHERS AND WHEN A CROPPER IS SET THERE IS NOTHING ON EARTH CAN CHANGE HIM HE SAYS FEMALE TEACHERS CAN'T KEEP ORDER
5163-39921-0007 YES THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN AND BIG FOR THEIR AGE YOU CAN'T WHIP EM THAT IS THE TROUBLE A MAN MIGHT BUT THEY'D TWIST YOU AROUND THEIR FINGERS YOU'LL HAVE YOUR HANDS FULL I'M AFRAID
5163-39921-0008 BUT MAYBE THEY'LL BEHAVE ALL RIGHT AFTER ALL MISTER BAXTER PRIVATELY HAD NO HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BUT ESTHER HOPED FOR THE BEST SHE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT MISTER CROPPER WOULD CARRY HIS PREJUDICES INTO A PERSONAL APPLICATION
5163-39921-0010 HOPED SHE WAS GETTING ON WELL AND SAID HE HAD TWO YOUNG RASCALS OF HIS OWN TO SEND SOON ESTHER FELT RELIEVED SHE THOUGHT THAT MISTER BAXTER HAD EXAGGERATED MATTERS A LITTLE THAT PLUM TREE OF MISSUS CHARLEY'S IS LOADED WITH FRUIT AGAIN THIS YEAR
5163-39921-0011 REMARKED MISTER BAXTER AT THE TEA TABLE THAT EVENING I CAME PAST IT TODAY ON MY WAY CROSS LOTS HOME FROM THE WOODS THERE WILL BE BUSHELS OF PLUMS ON IT
5163-39921-0013 YOU HAVEN'T ANY PROOF THAT IT IS REALLY THEM MARY OBJECTED HER HUSBAND AND YOU SHOULDN'T MAKE RECKLESS ACCUSATIONS BEFORE FOLKS I KNOW VERY WELL IT IS THEM
5163-39921-0014 AND MISSUS CHARLEY KNOWS IT TOO ALTHOUGH SHE CAN'T PROVE IT MORE'S THE PITY I DON'T SAY ISAAC CROPPER STEALS THOSE PLUMS WITH HIS OWN HANDS BUT HE KNOWS WHO DOES AND THE PLUMS GO INTO MEHITABLE CROPPER'S PRESERVING KETTLE
5163-39921-0016 THEY NEVER GOT ON WELL TOGETHER AND WHEN CHARLEY DIED THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS FUSS ABOUT THE PROPERTY ISAAC ACTED MEAN AND SCANDALOUS CLEAR THROUGH AND PUBLIC OPINION HAS BEEN DOWN ON HIM EVER SINCE
5163-39921-0017 BUT MISSUS CHARLEY IS A PRETTY SMART WOMAN AND HE DIDN'T GET THE BETTER OF HER IN EVERYTHING THERE WAS A STRIP OF DISPUTED LAND BETWEEN THE TWO FARMS AND SHE SECURED IT THERE'S A BIG PLUM TREE GROWING ON IT CLOSE TO THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0019 ASKED ESTHER THEY DISAPPEAR SAID MISTER BAXTER WITH A SIGNIFICANT NOD WHEN THE PLUMS ARE ANYTHING LIKE RIPE MISSUS CHARLEY DISCOVERS SOME DAY THAT THERE ISN'T ONE LEFT ON THE TREE
5163-39921-0020 SHE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO GET A SCRAP OF PROOF AS TO WHO TOOK THEM OR SHE'D MAKE IT HOT FOR THEM BUT NOBODY IN MAITLAND HAS ANY DOUBT IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ISAAC CROPPER KNOWS WHERE THOSE PLUMS GO
5163-39921-0022 I DON'T DOUBT THAT HE IS QUITE CLEAR IN HIS OWN MIND THAT THEY ARE AND HE DOES HATE MISSUS CHARLEY I'D GIVE CONSIDERABLE TO SEE THE OLD SINNER FAIRLY CAUGHT BUT HE IS TOO DEEP
5163-39921-0023 I THINK MISTER BAXTER IS TOO HARD ON MISTER CROPPER SAID ESTHER TO HERSELF LATER ON HE HAS PROBABLY SOME PRIVATE PREJUDICE AGAINST HIM BUT A MONTH LATER SHE HAD CHANGED HER OPINION
5163-39921-0025 FOR A FEW DAYS ALL WENT WELL AND ESTHER FELT DECIDEDLY RELIEVED BUT BEFORE LONG A SUBTLE SPIRIT OF INSUBORDINATION BEGAN TO MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE SCHOOL ESTHER FOUND HERSELF POWERLESS TO COPE WITH IT
5163-39921-0026 THE CROPPERS NEVER OPENLY DEFIED HER BUT THEY DID PRECISELY AS THEY PLEASED THE OTHER PUPILS THOUGHT THEMSELVES AT LIBERTY TO FOLLOW THIS EXAMPLE AND IN A MONTH'S TIME POOR ESTHER HAD COMPLETELY LOST CONTROL OF HER LITTLE KINGDOM
5163-39921-0028 BUT SHE WAS BAFFLED BY THE ELUSIVE SYSTEM OF DEFIANCE WHICH THE CROPPER BOYS HAD ORGANIZED ONE DAY SHE RESOLVED TO GO TO MISTER CROPPER HIMSELF AND APPEAL TO HIS SENSE OF JUSTICE IF HE HAD ANY
5163-39921-0029 IT HAD BEEN AN ESPECIALLY HARD DAY IN SCHOOL WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ABSENT AT THE NOON HOUR ALL THE DESKS IN THE SCHOOLROOM HAD BEEN PILED IN A PYRAMID ON THE FLOOR BOOKS AND SLATES INTERCHANGED AND VARIOUS OTHER PRANKS PLAYED
5163-39921-0031 SHE ALSO KNEW WHAT EXAGGERATED ACCOUNTS OF THE AFFAIR WOULD BE TAKEN HOME TO MAITLAND TEA TABLES AND SHE FELT LIKE SITTING DOWN TO CRY BUT SHE DID NOT INSTEAD SHE SET HER MOUTH FIRMLY HELPED THE CHILDREN RESTORE THE ROOM TO ORDER
5163-39921-0032 AND AFTER SCHOOL WENT UP TO ISAAC CROPPER'S HOUSE THAT GENTLEMAN HIMSELF CAME IN FROM THE HARVEST FIELD LOOKING AS COURTLY AS USUAL EVEN IN HIS ROUGH WORKING CLOTHES HE SHOOK HANDS HEARTILY TOLD HER HE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER
5163-39921-0034 I HAVE COME UP TO SEE YOU ABOUT ALFRED AND ROBERT MISTER CROPPER SHE SAID THEY ARE NOT BEHAVING WELL IN SCHOOL INDEED MISTER CROPPER'S VOICE EXPRESSED BLAND SURPRISE THAT IS STRANGE
5163-39921-0035 AS A RULE I DO NOT THINK ALFRED AND ROBERT HAVE BEEN TROUBLESOME TO THEIR TEACHERS WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN DOING NOW THEY REFUSE TO OBEY MY ORDERS SAID ESTHER FAINTLY
5163-39921-0037 NOT THAT I DISAPPROVE OF YOU PERSONALLY FAR FROM IT I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE YOU SUCCEED BUT I HAVE HEARD MANY COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ORDER IN SCHOOL AT PRESENT I HAD NO TROUBLE UNTIL YOUR BOYS CAME
5163-39921-0038 RETORTED ESTHER LOSING HER TEMPER A LITTLE AND I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU WERE WILLING TO CO OPERATE WITH ME THAT I COULD GOVERN THEM WELL YOU SEE SAID MISTER CROPPER EASILY
5163-39921-0040 WHY MY DEAR YOUNG LADY WHAT CAN I DO BOYS SOON KNOW WHEN THEY CAN DISOBEY A TEACHER WITH IMPUNITY NO DOUBT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE A SCHOOL EASIER TO CONTROL AND WILL DO GOOD WORK
5163-39921-0041 BUT HERE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID WE NEED A FIRM HAND AT THE HELM BUT YOU ARE NOT GOING YET MISS MAXWELL YOU NEED SOME REFRESHMENT AFTER YOUR LONG WALK MISSUS CROPPER WILL BRING YOU IN SOMETHING NO THANK YOU SAID POOR ESTHER
5163-39921-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY ESTHER WENT FOR AN AFTERNOON WALK CARRYING HER KODAK WITH HER IT WAS A BRILLIANTLY FINE AUTUMN DAY AND WOODS AND FIELDS WERE BASKING IN A MELLOW HAZE ESTHER WENT ACROSS LOTS TO MISSUS CHARLEY CROPPER'S HOUSE INTENDING TO MAKE A CALL
5163-39921-0044 BUT THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP AND EVIDENTLY DESERTED SO SHE RAMBLED PAST IT TO THE BACK FIELDS PASSING THROUGH A GROVE OF MAPLES SHE CAME OUT AMONG LEAFY YOUNG SAPLINGS ON THE OTHER SIDE JUST BEYOND HER WITH ITS LADEN BOUGHS HANGING OVER THE LINE FENCE
5163-39921-0046 AFTER THE PRELIMINARY REMARKS IN WHICH HE INDULGED SHE SAID WITH SEEMING IRRELEVANCE THAT SATURDAY HAD BEEN A FINE DAY THERE WAS AN EXCELLENT LIGHT FOR SNAPSHOTS SHE WENT ON COOLLY
5163-39921-0047 I HAVE BROUGHT YOU UP A PROOF I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IT SHE ROSE AND PLACED THE PROOF ON THE TABLE BEFORE MISTER CROPPER THE PLUM TREE CAME OUT CLEARLY
5163-39921-0049 HIS EYES HAD LOST THEIR UNCONCERNED GLITTER BUT HIS VOICE WAS DEFIANT THE PLUMS ARE MINE BY RIGHT HE SAID PERHAPS SAID ESTHER CALMLY BUT THERE ARE SOME WHO DO NOT THINK SO
5163-39921-0050 MISSUS CHARLEY FOR INSTANCE SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS PROOF I THINK DON'T SHOW IT TO HER CRIED MISTER CROPPER HASTILY I TELL YOU MISS MAXWELL THE PLUMS ARE MINE BUT I AM TIRED OF FIGHTING OVER THEM
5163-39921-0052 I ADMIT I WAS SOMEWHAT UNREASONABLE I'LL TALK TO ALFRED AND ROBERT AND SEE WHAT I CAN DO VERY WELL SAID ESTHER QUIETLY THE MATTER OF THE PLUMS ISN'T MY BUSINESS
5163-39921-0053 AND I DON'T WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR FAMILY FEUDS ESPECIALLY AS YOU SAY THAT YOU MEAN TO ALLOW MISSUS CHARLEY TO ENJOY HER OWN IN FUTURE AS FOR THE SCHOOL WE WILL HOPE THAT MATTERS WILL IMPROVE
5163-39921-0055 HAVING LOST THEIR LEADERS WERE SOON QUELLED COMPLAINT DIED AWAY AND AT THE END OF THE TERM ESTHER WAS RE ENGAGED YOU SEEM TO HAVE WON OLD CROPPER OVER TO YOUR SIDE ENTIRELY MISTER BAXTER TOLD HER THAT NIGHT
5163-39921-0056 I NEVER KNEW ISAAC CROPPER TO CHANGE HIS OPINIONS SO HANDSOMELY ESTHER SMILED
5192-19396-0001 THAT IT WAS SCARCE POSSIBLE FOR MY UNCLE TOBY TO HAVE DWELT IN ANY OTHER HOUSE IN THE WORLD OR TO HAVE OCCUPIED ANY OTHER GARDEN IN CHRISTENDOM BUT THE VERY HOUSE AND GARDEN WHICH JOIN'D AND LAID PARALLEL TO MISSUS WADMAN'S THIS WITH THE ADVANTAGE OF A THICKSET
5192-19396-0002 ARBOUR IN MISSUS WADMAN'S GARDEN BUT PLANTED IN THE HEDGE ROW OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S PUT ALL THE OCCASIONS INTO HER HANDS WHICH LOVE MILITANCY WANTED SHE COULD OBSERVE MY UNCLE TOBY'S MOTIONS
5192-19396-0004 THE BLIND GUT ANSWERED DOCTOR SLOP LIES BETWIXT THE ILION AND COLON IN A MAN SAID MY FATHER
5192-19396-0005 IN A WOMAN THAT'S MORE THAN I KNOW QUOTH MY FATHER
5192-19396-0007 AND WITH BRIDGET TO HELP HER SHE COULD NOT HAVE FOUND ANY ONE BLIND OR MANTELET SO FIT FOR HER PURPOSE AS THAT WHICH THE EXPEDIENCY OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S AFFAIRS HAD FIX'D UP READY TO HER HANDS I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT TOLD YOU BUT I DON'T KNOW POSSIBLY I HAVE BE IT AS IT WILL
5192-19396-0008 TIS ONE OF THE NUMBER OF THOSE MANY THINGS WHICH A MAN HAD BETTER DO OVER AGAIN THAN DISPUTE ABOUT IT THAT WHATEVER TOWN OR FORTRESS THE CORPORAL WAS AT WORK UPON DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CAMPAIGN MY UNCLE TOBY ALWAYS TOOK CARE ON THE INSIDE OF HIS SENTRY BOX
5192-19396-0010 SO THAT WHEN AN ATTACK WAS RESOLVED UPON MISSUS WADMAN HAD NOTHING MORE TO DO WHEN SHE HAD GOT ADVANCED TO THE DOOR OF THE SENTRY BOX BUT TO EXTEND HER RIGHT HAND
5192-19396-0011 TO TAKE HOLD OF THE MAP OR PLAN OR UPRIGHT OR WHATEVER IT WAS AND WITH OUT STRETCHED NECK MEETING IT HALF WAY TO ADVANCE IT TOWARDS HER ON WHICH MY UNCLE TOBY'S PASSIONS WERE SURE TO CATCH FIRE FOR HE WOULD INSTANTLY TAKE HOLD OF THE OTHER CORNER OF THE MAP IN HIS LEFT HAND
5192-19396-0013 UNDER ONE PRETENCE OR OTHER BUT GENERALLY THAT OF POINTING MORE DISTINCTLY AT SOME REDOUBT OR BREASTWORK IN THE MAP SHE WOULD EFFECT BEFORE MY UNCLE TOBY POOR SOUL HAD WELL MARCH'D ABOVE HALF A DOZEN TOISES WITH IT IT OBLIGED MY UNCLE TOBY TO MAKE USE OF HIS FOREFINGER
5192-19396-0014 THE DIFFERENCE IT MADE IN THE ATTACK WAS THIS THAT IN GOING UPON IT AS IN THE FIRST CASE WITH THE END OF HER FORE FINGER AGAINST THE END OF MY UNCLE TOBY'S TOBACCO PIPE SHE MIGHT HAVE TRAVELLED WITH IT ALONG THE LINES FROM DAN TO BEERSHEBA HAD MY UNCLE TOBY'S LINES REACH'D SO FAR
5192-19396-0016 WHEREAS IN FOLLOWING MY UNCLE TOBY'S FOREFINGER WITH HERS CLOSE THRO ALL THE LITTLE TURNS AND INDENTINGS OF HIS WORKS PRESSING SOMETIMES AGAINST THE SIDE OF IT THEN TREADING UPON ITS NAIL THEN TRIPPING IT UP THEN TOUCHING IT HERE THEN THERE AND SO ON
5192-19396-0017 IT SET SOMETHING AT LEAST IN MOTION THIS THO SLIGHT SKIRMISHING AND AT A DISTANCE FROM THE MAIN BODY YET DREW ON THE REST FOR HERE THE MAP USUALLY FALLING WITH THE BACK OF IT CLOSE TO THE SIDE OF THE SENTRY BOX MY UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0019 LARGE ENOUGH FOR ANY SENTIMENT TO PASS OR RE PASS WHICH A PERSON SKILL'D IN THE ELEMENTARY AND PRACTICAL PART OF LOVE MAKING HAS OCCASION FOR BY BRINGING UP HER FOREFINGER PARALLEL AS BEFORE TO MY UNCLE TOBY'S IT UNAVOIDABLY BROUGHT THE THUMB INTO ACTION
5192-19396-0020 AND THE FOREFINGER AND THUMB BEING ONCE ENGAGED AS NATURALLY BROUGHT IN THE WHOLE HAND THINE DEAR UNCLE TOBY
5192-19396-0022 WHILST THIS WAS DOING HOW COULD SHE FORGET TO MAKE HIM SENSIBLE
5192-19396-0023 WHICH SLIGHTLY PRESS'D AGAINST THE CALF OF HIS
5192-19396-0025 YOU WILL READILY CONCEIVE TO BE OF DIFFERENT KINDS VARYING FROM EACH OTHER LIKE THE ATTACKS WHICH HISTORY IS FULL OF AND FROM THE SAME REASONS A GENERAL LOOKER ON WOULD SCARCE ALLOW THEM TO BE ATTACKS AT ALL OR IF HE DID WOULD CONFOUND THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT I WRITE NOT TO THEM
5192-19396-0026 IT WILL BE TIME ENOUGH TO BE A LITTLE MORE EXACT IN MY DESCRIPTIONS OF THEM AS I COME UP TO THEM WHICH WILL NOT BE FOR SOME CHAPTERS HAVING NOTHING MORE TO ADD IN THIS BUT THAT IN A BUNDLE OF ORIGINAL PAPERS AND DRAWINGS WHICH MY FATHER TOOK CARE TO ROLL UP BY THEMSELVES
5192-19396-0028 WHICH THERE IS ALL THE REASON IN THE WORLD TO IMAGINE WERE MISSUS WADMAN'S FOR THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MARGIN WHICH I SUPPOSE TO HAVE BEEN MY UNCLE TOBY'S IS ABSOLUTELY CLEAN THIS SEEMS AN AUTHENTICATED RECORD OF ONE OF THESE ATTACKS
5192-19396-0029 BUT STILL VISIBLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER OF THE MAP WHICH ARE UNQUESTIONABLY THE VERY HOLES THROUGH WHICH IT HAS BEEN PRICKED UP IN THE SENTRY BOX BY ALL THAT IS PRIESTLY I VALUE THIS PRECIOUS RELICK WITH ITS STIGMATA AND PRICKS MORE THAN ALL THE RELICKS OF THE ROMISH CHURCH
5192-19396-0031 THE FORTIFICATIONS ARE QUITE DESTROYED
5192-19396-0032 I THINK SO TOO REPLIED MY UNCLE TOBY WITH A SIGH HALF SUPPRESS'D BUT STEP INTO THE PARLOUR TRIM FOR THE STIPULATION IT LIES UPON THE TABLE IT HAS LAIN THERE THESE SIX WEEKS REPLIED THE CORPORAL TILL THIS VERY MORNING THAT THE OLD WOMAN KINDLED THE FIRE WITH IT
5192-19397-0001 A SOLDIER CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY INTERRUPTING THE CORPORAL IS NO MORE EXEMPT FROM SAYING A FOOLISH THING TRIM THAN A MAN OF LETTERS BUT NOT SO OFTEN AN PLEASE YOUR HONOUR REPLIED THE CORPORAL MY UNCLE TOBY GAVE A NOD IT WAS A THOUSAND PITIES THEN SAID THE CORPORAL
5192-19397-0002 CASTING HIS EYE UPON DUNKIRK AND THE MOLE

5192-19397-0005 THOU ART RIGHT TRIM IN BOTH CASES SAID MY UNCLE TOBY THIS CONTINUED THE CORPORAL IS THE REASON THAT FROM THE BEGINNING OF THEIR DEMOLITION TO THE END I HAVE NEVER ONCE WHISTLED OR SUNG OR LAUGH'D OR CRY'D OR TALK'D OF PAST DONE DEEDS

5192-19397-0008 THEY ARE ALL TRUE FOR THEY ARE ABOUT MYSELF I DO NOT LIKE THE SUBJECT THE WORSE TRIM SAID MY UNCLE TOBY ON THAT SCORE BUT PRITHEE WHAT IS THIS STORY THOU HAST EXCITED MY CURIOSITY
5192-19397-0010 AND THE DISPOSITION I AM IN AT PRESENT WOULD WRONG BOTH THEE TRIM AND THY STORY IT IS NOT A MERRY ONE BY ANY MEANS REPLIED THE CORPORAL NOR WOULD I HAVE IT ALTOGETHER A GRAVE ONE ADDED MY UNCLE TOBY IT IS NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER REPLIED THE CORPORAL
5192-19397-0011 BUT WILL SUIT YOUR HONOUR EXACTLY THEN I'LL THANK THEE FOR IT WITH ALL MY HEART CRIED MY UNCLE TOBY SO PRITHEE BEGIN IT TRIM THE CORPORAL MADE HIS REVERENCE AND THOUGH IT IS NOT SO EASY A MATTER AS THE WORLD IMAGINES TO PULL OFF A LANK MONTERO CAP
5192-19397-0013 WHICH WAS TOWARDS HIS MASTER TO SLIP BACKWARDS UPON THE GRASS A LITTLE BEYOND HIS BODY IN ORDER TO ALLOW IT THE GREATER SWEEP AND BY AN UNFORCED COMPRESSION AT THE SAME TIME OF HIS CAP WITH THE THUMB AND THE TWO FOREFINGERS OF HIS LEFT BY WHICH THE DIAMETER
5192-19397-0014 OF THE CAP BECAME REDUCED SO THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID RATHER TO BE INSENSIBLY SQUEEZ'D THAN PULL'D OFF WITH A FLATUS THE CORPORAL ACQUITTED HIMSELF OF BOTH IN A BETTER MANNER THAN THE POSTURE OF HIS AFFAIRS PROMISED AND HAVING HEMMED TWICE
5192-19397-0016 HE AS THE CORPORAL WAS ENTERING THE CONFINES OF BOHEMIA MY UNCLE TOBY OBLIGED HIM TO HALT FOR A SINGLE MOMENT HE HAD SET OUT BARE HEADED HAVING SINCE HE PULL'D OFF HIS MONTERO CAP IN THE LATTER END OF THE LAST CHAPTER LEFT IT LYING BESIDE HIM ON THE GROUND
5192-19397-0017 SO THAT BEFORE THE CORPORAL HAD WELL GOT THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE WORDS OF HIS STORY HAD MY UNCLE TOBY TWICE TOUCH'D HIS MONTERO CAP WITH THE END OF HIS CANE INTERROGATIVELY AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ON TRIM TRIM TOOK IT UP WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL SLOWNESS

5192-19397-0082 IT DID NOT ALTOGETHER STRIKE THE CORPORAL'S FANCY WHEN HE HAD MADE IT BUT IT COULD NOT BE RECALL'D SO HE HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT PROCEED AS THE NUMBER OF WOUNDED WAS PRODIGIOUS AND NO ONE HAD TIME TO THINK OF ANY THING BUT HIS OWN SAFETY THOUGH TALMASH

5322-7678-0000 WHICH HAD RUN ON IN FRONT STARTED TWO PHEASANTS HE HAD HARDLY STEPPED AMONG THE BRIERS WHEN THE PHEASANTS BEGAN TO RISE AT EVERY STEP THE OLD MAN HAD NOT SHOWN HIM THAT PLACE THE DAY BEFORE AS HE MEANT TO KEEP IT FOR SHOOTING FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN
5322-7678-0002 PUT IN A BULLET ABOVE THE SMALL SHOT AND BRUSHING AWAY THE MOSQUITOES WITH THE WIDE SLEEVE OF HIS CIRCASSIAN COAT HE WENT SLOWLY TO THE SPOT WHERE THEY HAD BEEN THE DAY BEFORE IT WAS HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP BACK THE DOG
5322-7678-0003 WHO FOUND TRAILS ON THE VERY PATH AND OLENIN KILLED TWO MORE PHEASANTS SO THAT AFTER BEING DETAINED BY THIS IT WAS GETTING TOWARDS NOON BEFORE HE BEGAN TO FIND THE PLACE HE WAS LOOKING FOR THE DAY WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR
5322-7678-0005 ITS BACK BEING COVERED WITH MOSQUITOES AND SO HAD OLENIN'S COAT THROUGH WHICH THE INSECTS THRUST THEIR STINGS OLENIN WAS READY TO RUN AWAY FROM THEM AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE SUMMER
5322-7678-0006 HE WAS ABOUT TO GO HOME BUT REMEMBERING THAT OTHER PEOPLE MANAGED TO ENDURE SUCH PAIN HE RESOLVED TO BEAR IT AND GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BE DEVOURED AND STRANGE TO SAY BY NOONTIME THE FEELING BECAME ACTUALLY PLEASANT
5322-7678-0008 THE FOREST WOULD LOSE FOR HIM SOME OF ITS CHARACTER AND CHARM THESE MYRIADS OF INSECTS WERE SO WELL SUITED TO THAT MONSTROUSLY LAVISH WILD VEGETATION THESE MULTITUDES OF BIRDS AND BEASTS WHICH FILLED THE FOREST
5322-7678-0009 THIS DARK FOLIAGE THIS HOT SCENTED AIR
5322-7678-0011 NOW SEEMED PLEASANT AFTER GOING ROUND THE PLACE WHERE YESTERDAY THEY HAD FOUND THE ANIMAL AND NOT FINDING ANYTHING HE FELT INCLINED TO REST
5322-7678-0012 HAVING FOUND THE TRACES OF YESTERDAY'S STAG HE CREPT UNDER A BUSH INTO THE THICKET JUST WHERE THE STAG HAD LAIN AND LAY DOWN IN ITS LAIR HE EXAMINED THE DARK FOLIAGE AROUND HIM
5322-7678-0014 AND DID NOT THINK OF OR WISH FOR ANYTHING
5322-7678-0015 SUDDENLY WITH EXTRAORDINARY CLEARNESS HE THOUGHT HERE AM I DMITRI OLENIN A BEING QUITE DISTINCT FROM EVERY OTHER BEING NOW LYING ALL ALONE HEAVEN ONLY KNOWS WHERE WHERE A STAG USED TO LIVE
5322-7678-0017 ONE OF THEM FESTOONED WITH WILD GRAPE VINES AND PHEASANTS ARE FLUTTERING DRIVING ONE ANOTHER ABOUT AND PERHAPS SCENTING THEIR MURDERED BROTHERS HE FELT HIS PHEASANTS EXAMINED THEM
5322-7678-0018 AND WIPED THE WARM BLOOD OFF HIS HAND ONTO HIS COAT PERHAPS THE JACKALS SCENT THEM AND WITH DISSATISFIED FACES GO OFF IN ANOTHER DIRECTION ABOVE ME
5322-7678-0020 A HUNDRED A THOUSAND A MILLION MOSQUITOES AND ALL OF THEM BUZZ SOMETHING OR OTHER AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS SEPARATE FROM ALL ELSE AND IS JUST SUCH A SEPARATE DMITRI OLENIN AS I AM MYSELF
5322-7678-0021 HE VIVIDLY IMAGINED WHAT THE MOSQUITOES BUZZED THIS WAY THIS WAY LADS HERE'S SOME ONE WE CAN EAT THEY BUZZED AND STUCK TO HIM AND IT WAS CLEAR TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT A RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN A MEMBER OF MOSCOW SOCIETY
5322-7678-0023 GRASS WILL GROW AND NOTHING MORE BUT WHAT THOUGH THE GRASS DOES GROW HE CONTINUED THINKING STILL I MUST LIVE AND BE HAPPY BECAUSE HAPPINESS IS ALL I DESIRE
5322-7678-0024 NEVER MIND WHAT I AM AN ANIMAL LIKE ALL THE REST ABOVE WHOM THE GRASS WILL GROW AND NOTHING MORE OR A FRAME IN WHICH A BIT OF THE ONE GOD HAS BEEN SET STILL I MUST LIVE IN THE VERY BEST WAY
5322-7678-0026 THOUGH HE NOW SAW THAT ALL THE WHILE HE REALLY NEEDED NOTHING FOR HIMSELF AND HE LOOKED ROUND AT THE FOLIAGE WITH THE LIGHT SHINING THROUGH IT AT THE SETTING SUN AND THE CLEAR SKY AND HE FELT JUST AS HAPPY AS BEFORE WHY AM I HAPPY
5322-7678-0027 AND WHAT USED I TO LIVE FOR THOUGHT HE HOW MUCH I EXACTED FOR MYSELF HOW I SCHEMED AND DID NOT MANAGE TO GAIN ANYTHING BUT SHAME AND SORROW AND THERE NOW I REQUIRE NOTHING TO BE HAPPY
5322-7678-0029 IT FOLLOWS THAT IT IS THESE DESIRES THAT ARE ILLEGITIMATE BUT NOT THE NEED FOR HAPPINESS BUT WHAT DESIRES CAN ALWAYS BE SATISFIED DESPITE EXTERNAL CIRCUMSTANCES WHAT ARE THEY LOVE SELF SACRIFICE
5322-7678-0030 HE WAS SO GLAD AND EXCITED WHEN HE HAD DISCOVERED THIS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM NEW TRUTH THAT HE JUMPED UP AND BEGAN IMPATIENTLY SEEKING SOME ONE TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF FOR TO DO GOOD TO AND TO LOVE
5322-7678-0032 THE WEATHER AND THE CHARACTER OF THE FOREST THE SKY WAS WRAPPED IN CLOUDS THE WIND WAS RUSTLING IN THE TREE TOPS AND ALL AROUND NOTHING WAS VISIBLE BUT REEDS AND DYING BROKEN DOWN TREES
5322-7678-0033 HE CALLED TO HIS DOG WHO HAD RUN AWAY TO FOLLOW SOME ANIMAL AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK AS IN A DESERT AND SUDDENLY HE WAS SEIZED WITH A TERRIBLE SENSE OF WEIRDNESS HE GREW FRIGHTENED
5322-7678-0035 AND OF THE FUTURE LIFE AS FOR LONG HE HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THEM AND ALL AROUND WAS THAT SAME GLOOMY STERN WILD NATURE AND IS IT WORTH WHILE LIVING FOR ONESELF THOUGHT HE
5322-7678-0036 WHEN AT ANY MOMENT YOU MAY DIE AND DIE WITHOUT HAVING DONE ANY GOOD AND SO THAT NO ONE WILL KNOW OF IT HE WENT IN THE DIRECTION WHERE HE FANCIED THE VILLAGE LAY OF HIS SHOOTING HE HAD NO FURTHER THOUGHT
5322-7678-0038 AFTER HAVING WANDERED ABOUT FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME HE CAME UPON A DITCH DOWN WHICH WAS FLOWING COLD SANDY WATER FROM THE TEREK AND NOT TO GO ASTRAY ANY LONGER HE DECIDED TO FOLLOW IT
5322-7678-0039 HE WENT ON WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE DITCH WOULD LEAD HIM SUDDENLY THE REEDS BEHIND HIM CRACKLED HE SHUDDERED AND SEIZED HIS GUN AND THEN FELT ASHAMED OF HIMSELF
5322-7679-0001 WITH THE DIM COLOURED WET SAND OF ITS BANKS AND SHALLOWS THE DISTANT STEPPE THE CORDON WATCH TOWER OUTLINED ABOVE THE WATER A SADDLED AND HOBBLED HORSE AMONG THE BRAMBLES AND THEN THE MOUNTAINS OPENING OUT BEFORE HIM
5322-7679-0002 THE RED SUN APPEARED FOR AN INSTANT FROM UNDER A CLOUD AND ITS LAST RAYS GLITTERED BRIGHTLY ALONG THE RIVER OVER THE REEDS ON THE WATCH TOWER
5322-7679-0004 HE HAD COME UPON THE NIZHNI PROTOTSK POST ON THE TEREK OPPOSITE A PRO RUSSIAN TARTAR VILLAGE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER HE ACCOSTED THE COSSACKS BUT NOT FINDING AS YET ANY EXCUSE FOR DOING ANYONE A KINDNESS HE ENTERED THE HUT
5322-7679-0005 BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DIVERT THEM THAT EVENING SOME HOSTILE CHECHENS RELATIVES OF THE ABREK WHO HAD BEEN KILLED HAD COME FROM THE HILLS WITH A SCOUT TO RANSOM THE BODY
5322-7679-0007 WAS CALM AND MAJESTIC AS A KING HIS FACE WAS VERY LIKE THAT OF THE DEAD ABREK HE DID NOT DEIGN TO LOOK AT ANYONE AND NEVER ONCE GLANCED AT THE DEAD BODY BUT SITTING ON HIS HEELS IN THE SHADE HE SPAT AS HE SMOKED HIS SHORT PIPE
5322-7679-0008 AND OCCASIONALLY UTTERED SOME FEW GUTTURAL SOUNDS OF COMMAND WHICH WERE RESPECTFULLY LISTENED TO BY HIS COMPANION HE WAS EVIDENTLY A BRAVE WHO HAD MET RUSSIANS MORE THAN ONCE BEFORE IN QUITE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES AND NOTHING ABOUT THEM COULD ASTONISH OR EVEN INTEREST HIM
5322-7679-0010 THE SCOUT HASTENED TO COVER THE DEAD MAN'S FACE WITH HIS COAT OLENIN WAS STRUCK
5322-7679-0011 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK TO HIM ASKING FROM WHAT VILLAGE HE CAME BUT THE CHECHEN SCARCELY GIVING HIM A GLANCE SPAT CONTEMPTUOUSLY AND TURNED AWAY
5322-7679-0013 BUT INSTEAD OF BEING RED HAIRED HE WAS BLACK HAIRED RESTLESS WITH EXTREMELY WHITE GLEAMING TEETH AND SPARKLING BLACK EYES THE SCOUT WILLINGLY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION AND ASKED FOR A CIGARETTE THERE WERE FIVE BROTHERS
5322-7679-0014 BEGAN THE SCOUT IN HIS BROKEN RUSSIAN THIS IS THE THIRD BROTHER THE RUSSIANS HAVE KILLED ONLY TWO ARE LEFT HE IS A BRAVE A GREAT BRAVE HE SAID POINTING TO THE CHECHEN
5322-7679-0016 LUKASHKA WENT UP TO THE SPEAKER AND SAT DOWN OF WHAT VILLAGE ASKED HE FROM THERE IN THE HILLS REPLIED THE SCOUT POINTING TO THE MISTY BLUISH GORGE BEYOND THE TEREK DO YOU KNOW SUUK SU IT IS ABOUT EIGHT MILES BEYOND THAT
5322-7679-0017 EVIDENTLY PROUD OF THE ACQUAINTANCE HE IS MY KUNAK HE IS MY NEIGHBOUR ANSWERED THE SCOUT HE'S A TRUMP AND LUKASHKA EVIDENTLY MUCH INTERESTED BEGAN TALKING TO THE SCOUT IN TARTAR PRESENTLY A COSSACK CAPTAIN
5322-7679-0019 AS IS CUSTOMARY IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY AND ONLY A FEW REPLIED WITH A BOW SOME AND AMONG THEM LUKASHKA ROSE AND STOOD ERECT THE CORPORAL REPLIED THAT ALL WAS WELL AT THE OUTPOSTS ALL THIS SEEMED RIDICULOUS
5322-7679-0020 IT WAS AS IF THESE COSSACKS WERE PLAYING AT BEING SOLDIERS BUT THESE FORMALITIES SOON GAVE PLACE TO ORDINARY WAYS OF BEHAVIOUR AND THE CAPTAIN WHO WAS A SMART COSSACK JUST LIKE THE OTHERS BEGAN SPEAKING FLUENTLY IN TARTAR TO THE INTERPRETER
5322-7679-0022 I HAVE REPORTED YOUR EXPLOIT TO THE COMMANDER I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL COME OF IT I HAVE RECOMMENDED YOU FOR A CROSS YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE MADE A SERGEANT CAN YOU READ I CAN'T BUT WHAT A FINE FELLOW TO LOOK AT SAID THE CAPTAIN
5322-7679-0023 AGAIN PLAYING THE COMMANDER PUT ON YOUR CAP WHICH OF THE GAVRILOVS DOES HE COME OF THE BROAD EH HIS NEPHEW REPLIED THE CORPORAL
5322-7679-0025 WHEN THE BODY HAD BEEN CARRIED TO THE SKIFF THE BROTHER CHECHEN DESCENDED TO THE BANK THE COSSACKS INVOLUNTARILY STEPPED ASIDE TO LET HIM PASS HE JUMPED INTO THE BOAT AND PUSHED OFF FROM THE BANK WITH HIS POWERFUL LEG AND NOW
5322-7679-0026 AS OLENIN NOTICED FOR THE FIRST TIME THREW A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THE COSSACKS AND THEN ABRUPTLY ASKED HIS COMPANION A QUESTION THE LATTER ANSWERED SOMETHING AND POINTED TO LUKASHKA
5322-7679-0028 YOURS KILL OURS OURS SLAY YOURS IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME REPLIED THE SCOUT EVIDENTLY INVENTING AND HE SMILED SHOWING HIS WHITE TEETH AS HE JUMPED INTO THE SKIFF THE DEAD MAN'S BROTHER SAT MOTIONLESS
5322-7679-0029 GAZING AT THE OPPOSITE BANK HE WAS SO FULL OF HATRED AND CONTEMPT THAT THERE WAS NOTHING ON THIS SIDE OF THE RIVER THAT MOVED HIS CURIOSITY THE SCOUT STANDING UP AT ONE END OF THE SKIFF
5322-7679-0031 AND AT LAST STILL WITHIN SIGHT THEY LANDED ON THE OPPOSITE BANK WHERE THEIR HORSES STOOD WAITING THERE THEY LIFTED OUT THE CORPSE AND THOUGH THE HORSE SHIED LAID IT ACROSS ONE OF THE SADDLES
5322-7679-0032 MOUNTED AND RODE AT A FOOT PACE ALONG THE ROAD PAST A TARTAR VILLAGE FROM WHICH A CROWD CAME OUT TO LOOK AT THEM THE COSSACKS ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE OF THE RIVER WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED AND JOVIAL LAUGHTER AND JOKES WERE HEARD ON ALL SIDES
5322-7679-0034 LOOK THERE NOW THE MOUNTAINS ARE NOT FAR OFF CONTINUED LUKASHKA YET YOU CAN'T GET THERE HOW WILL YOU GET BACK ALONE IT'S GETTING DARK I'LL TAKE YOU IF YOU LIKE YOU ASK THE CORPORAL TO GIVE ME LEAVE WHAT A FINE FELLOW
5322-7679-0035 THOUGHT OLENIN LOOKING AT THE COSSACK'S BRIGHT FACE

5322-7680-0001 OLENIN THOUGHT THAT LUKASHKA WANTED TO SEE MARYANKA AND HE WAS ALSO GLAD OF THE COMPANIONSHIP OF SUCH A PLEASANT LOOKING AND SOCIABLE COSSACK LUKASHKA AND MARYANKA HE INVOLUNTARILY UNITED IN HIS MIND AND HE FOUND PLEASURE IN THINKING ABOUT THEM
5322-7680-0002 HE LOVES MARYANKA THOUGHT OLENIN AND I COULD LOVE HER AND A NEW AND POWERFUL EMOTION OF TENDERNESS OVERCAME HIM AS THEY WALKED HOMEWARDS TOGETHER THROUGH THE DARK FOREST LUKASHKA TOO FELT HAPPY
5322-7680-0004 BY THE MIDDLE ONE BUT I'LL SEE YOU AS FAR AS THE MARSH AFTER THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR OLENIN LAUGHED

5322-7680-0019 THE OUTLINES OF THE HUTS WERE CLEARLY TO BE SEEN LIGHTS GLEAMED AND THE AIR WAS FILLED WITH THE PECULIAR SMELL OF KISYAK SMOKE OLENIN FELT KEENLY THAT NIGHT ESPECIALLY THAT HERE IN THIS VILLAGE WAS HIS HOME HIS FAMILY
5322-7680-0020 ALL HIS HAPPINESS AND THAT HE NEVER HAD AND NEVER WOULD LIVE SO HAPPILY ANYWHERE AS HE DID IN THIS COSSACK VILLAGE HE WAS SO FOND OF EVERYBODY AND ESPECIALLY OF LUKASHKA THAT NIGHT

5322-7680-0029 HE ASKED ME TO LIE IN AMBUSH BY THE ROAD WHERE THEY COME DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS SHALL WE GO TOGETHER I'LL NOT BETRAY YOU
5322-7680-0031 LUKASHKA WENT OUT HANGING HIS HEAD THEN HAVING LED THE HORSE OUT OF THE GATE HE SUDDENLY SHOOK HIS HEAD THREW THE REINS OF THE HALTER OVER ITS HEAD SPRANG ONTO ITS BACK LIKE A CAT GAVE A WILD SHOUT AND GALLOPED DOWN THE STREET
5322-7680-0032 BUT THOUGH HE DID NOT DO SO OLENIN STILL FELT HIS SOUL MORE AT EASE THAN EVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HE WAS AS DELIGHTED AS A BOY
5339-14133-0000 BLACK AND BITTER BUT WELCOME ENOUGH TO THE FARMERS
5339-14133-0001 AND BELL ROBSON THOUGH NOT GETTING WORSE DID NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS TOWARDS AMENDMENT
5339-14133-0003 LIKE NANCY AND BORROWING THE POOR GIRL'S OWN WORDS SHE WOULD SAY SOFTLY TO HERSELF HE ONCE WAS HERE BUT ALL ALONG SHE BELIEVED IN HER HEART HE WOULD COME BACK AGAIN TO HER THOUGH IT TOUCHED HER STRANGELY TO IMAGINE THE AGONIES OF FORSAKEN LOVE
5339-14133-0004 HE WAS VERY BUSY WITH FACTS AND FIGURES
5339-14133-0006 BY DEGREES BOTH HEPBURN AND COULSON WERE INTRODUCED TO DISTANT MANUFACTURERS AND WHOLESALE DEALERS
5339-14133-0007 BUT THIS IT WAS EVIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE SATISFIED THEIR MASTERS WHO WERE SCRUPULOUS IN INSISTING THAT WHATEVER ADVANTAGE THERE WAS SHOULD ALWAYS FALL ON THE SIDE OF THE YOUNGER MEN WHEN PHILIP SAW SYLVIA SHE WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND GENTLE
5339-14133-0009 SO LONG AS SHE SPOKE GRACIOUSLY TO HIM HE THOUGHT SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM LONG CONTINUED ANXIETY ABOUT HER MOTHER OR THAT SHE HAD TOO MUCH TO DO AND EITHER CAUSE WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM TREAT HER WITH A GRAVE REGARD AND DEFERENCE WHICH HAD A REPRESSED TENDERNESS IN IT
5339-14133-0010 OF WHICH SHE OTHERWISE OCCUPIED WAS QUITE UNAWARE SHE LIKED HIM BETTER TOO THAN SHE HAD DONE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE BECAUSE HE DID NOT SHOW HER ANY OF THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH TEASED HER THEN ALTHOUGH ITS MEANING WAS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD
5339-14133-0012 TO SPEND A FORTNIGHT WITH A KINDLY NEIGHBOUR WHO LIVED NEAR THE FARM THEY HAD OCCUPIED FORTY MILES OR SO INLAND BEFORE THEY CAME TO HAYTERSBANK THE WIDOW WOMAN WAS TO COME AND STAY IN THE HOUSE TO KEEP SYLVIA COMPANY DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE
5339-14133-0013 DANIEL INDEED WAS TO RETURN HOME AFTER CONVEYING HIS WIFE TO HER DESTINATION BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE DONE ON THE LAND AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR THAT SYLVIA WOULD HAVE BEEN ALONE ALL DAY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE ARRANGEMENT JUST MENTIONED
5339-14133-0015 CONSCIOUS OF THE DEMAND IN WHICH THEY WERE HELD AT THIS SEASON OF THE YEAR IT WAS WAR TIME TOO MANY CAPTAINS UNABLE TO PROCURE MEN IN MONKSHAVEN WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE THEIR CREWS IN THE SHETLANDS THE SHOPS IN THE TOWN WERE EQUALLY BUSY
5339-14133-0016 STORES HAD TO BE PURCHASED BY THE WHALING MASTERS WARM CLOTHING OF ALL SORTS TO BE PROVIDED THESE WERE THE LARGER WHOLESALE ORDERS BUT MANY A MAN AND WOMAN TOO BROUGHT OUT THEIR SMALL HOARDS TO PURCHASE EXTRA COMFORTS OR PRECIOUS KEEPSAKES FOR SOME BELOVED ONE
5339-14133-0018 THERE WAS MUCH TO BE DONE IN FOSTERS SHOP AND LATER HOURS WERE KEPT THAN USUAL SOME PERPLEXITY OR OTHER WAS OCCUPYING JOHN AND JEREMIAH FOSTER
5339-14133-0019 BUT IT THUS HAPPENED THAT THEY DID NOT GIVE THE PROMPT ASSISTANCE THEY WERE ACCUSTOMED TO RENDER AT SUCH TIMES AND COULSON HAD BEEN AWAY ON SOME OF THE NEW EXPEDITIONS DEVOLVING ON HIM AND PHILIP AS FUTURE PARTNERS
5339-14133-0021 IS HE HERE AGAIN SAID PHILIP I DIDN'T SEE HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM HERE
5339-14133-0022 I WISH I'D SEEN HIM SAID COULSON
5339-14133-0024 AND THEN MY MASTER SAW ANOTHER GIRL THAT HE LIKED BETTER' WILLIAM ALMOST CHOKED IN HIS ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP DOWN ALL APPEARANCE OF VIOLENT ANGER AND THEN WENT ON AND THAT HE PLAYED T SAME GAME WI AS I'VE HEERD TELL AND HOW DID THY SISTER TAKE IT
5339-14133-0025 SHE DIED IN A SIX MONTH SAID WILLIAM SHE FORGIVED HIM BUT IT'S BEYOND ME I THOUGHT IT WERE HIM WHEN I HEERD OF T WORK ABOUT DARLEY KINRAID AND COMING FRA NEWCASSEL WHERE ANNIE LIVED PRENTICE AND I MADE INQUIRY
5339-14133-0027 HE HAD ONLY COME THAT AFTERNOON TO MONKSHAVEN AND FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF SEEING SYLVIA ONCE MORE BEFORE HE WENT TO FULFIL HIS ENGAGEMENT AS SPECKSIONEER IN THE URANIA A WHALING VESSEL THAT WAS TO SAIL FROM NORTH SHIELDS ON THURSDAY MORNING AND THIS WAS MONDAY
5339-14133-0028 SYLVIA SAT IN THE HOUSE PLACE HER BACK TO THE LONG LOW WINDOW IN ORDER TO HAVE ALL THE LIGHT THE AFTERNOON HOUR AFFORDED FOR HER WORK A BASKET OF HER FATHER'S UNMENDED STOCKINGS WAS ON THE LITTLE ROUND TABLE BESIDE HER
5339-14133-0030 IT WAS REDD UP FOR THE AFTERNOON COVERED WITH A BLACK MASS OF COAL OVER WHICH THE EQUALLY BLACK KETTLE HUNG ON THE CROOK IN THE BACK KITCHEN DOLLY REID SYLVIA'S ASSISTANT DURING HER MOTHER'S ABSENCE CHANTED A LUGUBRIOUS DITTY BEFITTING HER CONDITION AS A WIDOW
5339-14133-0031 CHARLEY KINRAID AND THE STORY OF CRAZY NANCY HAD BEEN THE SUBJECTS FOR HER DREAMS FOR MANY A DAY AND MANY A NIGHT NOW HE STOOD THERE BRIGHT AND HANDSOME AS EVER WITH JUST THAT MUCH TIMIDITY IN HIS FACE THAT ANXIETY AS TO HIS WELCOME
5339-14133-0033 THE TONES THE LOOKS THAT HAD ACCOMPANIED THOSE WORDS BUT ALL SHE SAID WAS I DIDN'T THINK TO SEE YO
5339-14133-0034 SHE FELT HIS EYES WERE UPON HER WATCHING EVERY MOTION AND GREW MORE AND MORE CONFUSED IN HER EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR HE WAS A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK BY THE NATURE OF HIS RECEPTION AND WAS NOT SURE AT FIRST WHETHER TO TAKE THE GREAT CHANGE IN HER MANNER
5339-14133-0036 AND SO DID HE AND WHEN THEY ROSE UP HE HAD FAST HOLD OF HER HAND AND HER FACE WAS TURNED AWAY HALF READY TO CRY
5339-14133-0037 YO MIGHT HA FORGOTTEN ME AND YET I THOUGHT WE MADE A BARGAIN AGAINST FORGETTING EACH OTHER NO ANSWER HE WENT ON YO'VE NEVER BEEN OUT O MY THOUGHTS SYLVIA ROBSON
5339-14133-0039 TILL I'D TAUGHT HER TO LOVE ME MORE BUT IF SHE'S A COLD HEART AND CANNOT CARE FOR A HONEST SAILOR WHY THEN I'D BEST GO BACK AT ONCE HE MADE FOR THE DOOR HE MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY SURE FROM SOME SIGN OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NEVER HAVE LEFT IT TO HER WOMANLY PRIDE TO GIVE WAY
5339-14133-0040 HE HAD NOT TAKEN TWO STEPS WHEN SHE TURNED QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM AND SAID SOMETHING
5339-14133-0042 HE HAD INTENDED IF NECESSARY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS WISHES AND DESIRES WITH REGARD TO SYLVIA TO HER PARENTS BUT FOR VARIOUS REASONS HE WAS NOT SORRY THAT CIRCUMSTANCES
5339-14133-0043 HAD GIVEN HIM THE CHANCE OF SEEING HER ALONE AND OBTAINING HER PROMISE TO MARRY HIM WITHOUT BEING OBLIGED TO TELL EITHER HER FATHER OR HER MOTHER AT PRESENT I HA SPENT MY MONEY PRETTY FREE HE SAID AND I'VE NE'ER A PENNY TO THE FORE
5339-14133-0045 I SHALL GO TO SEA HAPPY NOW THINKING I'VE YO'R WORD YO'RE NOT ONE TO GO BACK FROM IT I'M SURE ELSE IT'S A LONG TIME TO LEAVE SUCH A PRETTY GIRL AS YO AND NE'ER A CHANCE OF A LETTER REACHING YO JUST TO TELL YO ONCE AGAIN HOW I LOVE YO
5339-14133-0046 THERE'LL BE NO NEED O THAT MURMURED SYLVIA SHE WAS TOO DIZZY WITH HAPPINESS TO HAVE ATTENDED MUCH TO HIS DETAILS OF HIS WORLDLY PROSPECTS BUT AT THE SOUND OF HIS TENDER WORDS OF LOVE HER EAGER HEART WAS READY TO LISTEN I DON'T KNOW
5339-14133-0048 HE'S A NOTION OF BEING SWEET ON YO HISSELF NOT HE SAID SYLVIA WITH SOME CONTEMPT IN HER TONE
5339-14133-0049 BUT SHE WEARY OF A SUBJECT SHE CARED NOTHING ABOUT AND EAGER TO IDENTIFY HERSELF WITH ALL HIS INTERESTS ASKED HIM ABOUT HIS PLANS ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT HE SAID THESE LAST WORDS AND THEY WENT ON AS LOVERS DO
5339-14133-0051 ROBSON LISTENED TO ALL HE SAID WITH APPROVING NODS AND WINKS TILL CHARLEY HAD TOLD HIM EVERYTHING HE HAD TO SAY AND THEN HE TURNED AND STRUCK HIS BROAD HORNY PALM INTO KINRAID'S AS IF CONCLUDING A BARGAIN
5339-14133-0052 HE WOUND UP WITH A CHUCKLE AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM THAT THIS GREAT PIECE OF BUSINESS OF DISPOSING OF THEIR ONLY CHILD HAD BEEN CONCLUDED WHILE HIS WIFE WAS AWAY
5339-14133-0054 WE'N BEST KEEP THIS MATTER TO OURSELVES TILL THOU COMES INT PORT AGAIN
5339-14133-0055 AN OUD MAN LIKE ME ISN'T AS GOOD COMPANY AS A PRETTY LASS LAUGHING A LOW RICH LAUGH OVER HIS OWN WIT DANIEL WENT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND CALLED SYLVIE
5339-14134-0000 OF THE NUMBER OF LETTERS THAT ARRIVED IN MONKSHAVEN THE FOSTERS SHOPKEEPERS AND BANKERS HAD THE LARGEST SHARE THE MORNING SUCCEEDING THE DAY ON WHICH SYLVIA HAD ENGAGED HERSELF TO KINRAID THE FOSTERS SEEMED UNUSUALLY ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN THEIR LETTERS
5339-14134-0001 SEVERAL TIMES JEREMIAH CAME OUT OF THE PARLOUR IN WHICH HIS BROTHER JOHN WAS SITTING IN EXPECTANT SILENCE AND PASSING THROUGH THE SHOP LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE MARKET PLACE IN SEARCH OF THE OLD LAME WOMAN WHO WAS CHARITABLY EMPLOYED TO DELIVER LETTERS
5339-14134-0003 WITH HER BASKET OF LETTERS ONE OF THESE SEEMED OF ESPECIAL CONSEQUENCE TO THE GOOD BROTHERS THEY EACH SEPARATELY LOOKED AT THE DIRECTION AND THEN AT ONE ANOTHER AND WITHOUT A WORD THEY RETURNED WITH IT UNREAD INTO THE PARLOUR SHUTTING THE DOOR AND DRAWING THE GREEN SILK CURTAIN CLOSE THE BETTER TO READ IT IN PRIVACY
5339-14134-0004 AND WERE PERHAPS AS FULL OF CONSIDERATION AS TO THE POSSIBLE CONTENTS OF THIS LONDON LETTER
5339-14134-0006 IT WAS APPARENTLY BY JOHN FOSTER'S WISH THAT PHILIP HAD BEEN SUMMONED JEREMIAH THE LESS ENERGETIC AND DECIDED BROTHER WAS STILL DISCUSSING THE PROPRIETY OF THE STEP WHEN PHILIP ENTERED
5339-14134-0007 THAT THE FOSTERS HAD FOR SOME TIME RECEIVED ANONYMOUS LETTERS WARNING THEM WITH DISTINCT MEANING THOUGH IN AMBIGUOUS TERMS AGAINST A CERTAIN SILK MANUFACTURER IN SPITALFIELDS WITH WHOM THEY HAD HAD STRAIGHTFORWARD BUSINESS DEALINGS FOR MANY YEARS
5339-14134-0009 BUT THE NAME WAS TOTALLY UNKNOWN TO THEM THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO REASON TO DOUBT THE REALITY OF EITHER IT OR THE ADDRESS THE LATTER OF WHICH WAS GIVEN IN FULL
5339-14134-0010 AND WAS PUBLICLY DISTINGUISHED FOR HIS EXCELLENT AND PHILANTHROPIC CHARACTER BUT THESE LETTERS WERE PROVOCATIVE OF ANXIETY ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS MORNING'S POST HAD BROUGHT OUT THE WRITER'S FULL NAME AND VARIOUS PARTICULARS SHOWING HIS INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF DICKINSON'S AFFAIRS
5339-14134-0012 EVEN NOW JEREMIAH WAS ASHAMED OF THEIR WANT OF CONFIDENCE IN ONE SO GOOD HE BELIEVED THAT THE INFORMATION THEY HAD RECEIVED WOULD ALL PROVE A MISTAKE FOUNDED ON ERRONEOUS GROUNDS IF NOT A PURE INVENTION OF AN ENEMY
5339-14134-0013 AND HE HAD ONLY BEEN BROUGHT PARTIALLY TO CONSENT TO THE SENDING OF HEPBURN BY HIS BROTHER'S PLEDGING HIMSELF THAT THE REAL NATURE OF PHILIP'S ERRAND SHOULD BE UNKNOWN TO ANY HUMAN CREATURE SAVE THEM THREE AS ALL THIS WAS BEING REVEALED TO PHILIP HE SAT APPARENTLY UNMOVED AND SIMPLY ATTENTIVE
5339-14134-0015 JOHN PERCEIVED THAT HIS MESSENGER WOULD EXERCISE PENETRATION AND ACT WITH ENERGY WHILE JEREMIAH WAS SOOTHED BY PHILIP'S CAUTION IN NOT HASTILY ADMITTING THE PROBABILITY OF ANY CHARGE AGAINST DICKINSON AND IN GIVING FULL WEIGHT TO HIS PREVIOUS GOOD CONDUCT AND GOOD CHARACTER
5339-14134-0016 PHILIP HAD THE SATISFACTION OF FEELING HIMSELF EMPLOYED ON A MISSION WHICH WOULD CALL OUT HIS POWERS AND YET NOT EXCEED THEM IN HIS OWN MIND HE FORESTALLED THE INSTRUCTIONS OF HIS MASTERS AND WAS SILENTLY IN ADVANCE OF JOHN FOSTER'S PLANS AND ARRANGEMENTS
5339-14134-0018 SAYING IT WAS MORE THAN HE SHOULD REQUIRE BUT THEY REPEATED WITH FRESH URGENCY THEIR WARNINGS ABOUT THE TERRIBLE HIGH PRICES OF LONDON TILL HE COULD ONLY RESOLVE TO KEEP A STRICT ACCOUNT AND BRING BACK ALL THAT HE DID NOT EXPEND SINCE NOTHING BUT HIS TAKING THE WHOLE SUM WOULD SATISFY HIS EMPLOYERS
5339-14134-0019 THE LATTER WAS SILENT BROODING OVER THE CONFIDENCE WHICH PHILIP HAD APPARENTLY RECEIVED BUT WHICH WAS WITHHELD FROM HIM HE DID NOT YET KNOW OF THE CULMINATING POINT OF PHILIP'S PROPOSED JOURNEY TO LONDON
5339-14134-0021 OF NOT SEEING HER FOR A WEEK A FORTNIGHT NAY HE MIGHT BE AWAY FOR A MONTH FOR NO RASH HURRY WAS TO MAR HIS DELICATE NEGOTIATION GNAWED AT HIS HEART
5339-14134-0022 SEVERAL TIMES THAT DAY AS HE PERCEIVED COULSON'S JEALOUS SULLENNESS
5339-14134-0024 TO LUNNON EXCLAIMED ALICE HESTER SAID NOTHING
5339-14134-0025 SAID COULSON LUCK SAID ALICE TURNING SHARP ROUND ON HIM NIVER LET ME HEAR SUCH A VAIN WORD OUT O THY MOUTH LADDIE AGAIN IT'S THE LORD'S DOING AND LUCK'S THE DEVIL'S WAY O PUTTING IT
5339-14134-0027 BUT IF THAT'S THE FRAME O MIND THOU'RT IN LUNNON IS LIKE FOR TO BE A SORE PLACE O TEMPTATION THERE'S PITFALLS FOR MEN AND TRAPS FOR MONEY AT IVERY TURN AS I'VE HEERD SAY
5339-14134-0028 SAID COULSON HE'S SENT FOR
5339-14134-0030 IN THE RESPONSIBILITY WHICH IT INVOLVED AND HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO LEAVE MONKSHAVEN HE SAID COULSON I'D GIVE A DEAL IT WERE THOU THAT WERE GOING AND NOT ME AT LEAST THERE IS MANY A TIME I'D GIVE A DEAL
5339-14134-0031 I'LL NOT DENY BUT AT OTHER TIMES I'M PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT ON'T BUT IF I COULD I'D CHANGE PLACES WI THEE AT THIS MOMENT IT'S FINE TALKING SAID COULSON HALF MOLLIFIED AND YET NOT CARING TO SHOW IT I MAKE NO DOUBT IT WERE AN EVEN CHANCE BETWIXT US TWO AT FIRST
5339-14134-0033 WHAT'S TO DO HESTER SAID HE SHE LIFTED UP THOSE EYES USUALLY SO SOFT AND SERENE NOW THEY WERE FULL OF THE LIGHT OF INDIGNATION SHINING THROUGH TEARS TO DO SHE SAID COULSON I'D THOUGHT BETTER OF THEE
5339-14134-0034 GOING AND DOUBTING AND ENVYING PHILIP AS NIVER DID THEE AN ILL TURN OR SAID AN ILL WORD OR THOUGHT AN ILL THOUGHT BY THEE AND SENDING HIM AWAY OUT O T HOUSE THIS LAST NIGHT OF ALL
5339-14134-0036 AND YET HE WAS REPROACHED FOR THE COURSE IT WAS TAKING
5339-14134-0037 AND TILL HE HAD PATIENTLY WITH LONG CONTINUING AND DEEP AFFECTION WORKED HIS WAY INTO HER REGARD WAS SET ASIDE DURING THE PRESENT WALK HE WOULD SPEAK TO HER OF HIS PASSIONATE ATTACHMENT BEFORE HE LEFT FOR AN UNCERTAIN LENGTH OF TIME AND THE CERTAIN DISTANCE OF LONDON
5339-14134-0039 HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS LOVE AT HER FEET NOT EVEN URGING THE YOUNG GIRL TO MAKE ANY RETURN OR TO EXPRESS THE FEELINGS OF WHICH HE HOPED THE GERM WAS ALREADY BUDDING IN HER HE WOULD BE PATIENT WITH HER HE COULD NOT BE PATIENT HIMSELF
5339-14134-0040 THEY HAD SEEN HIM ALREADY OR HIS IMPULSE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO DODGE BEHIND THE WALL AND AVOID THEM EVEN THOUGH ONE OF HIS PURPOSES IN GOING TO HAYTERSBANK HAD BEEN TO BID HIS UNCLE FAREWELL KINRAID TOOK HIM BY SURPRISE FROM THE HEARTY GREETING HE GAVE HIM
5339-14134-0042 HE TOLD HIS UNCLE THAT HE WAS BOUND FOR LONDON THE NEXT DAY ON BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH THE FOSTERS DANIEL WAS DEEPLY STRUCK WITH THE FACT THAT HE WAS TALKING TO A MAN SETTING OFF FOR LONDON AT A DAY'S NOTICE

5339-14134-0048 SO THEY PARTED BUT PHILIP HAD NOT GONE MANY STEPS BEFORE HIS UNCLE CALLED HIM BACK KINRAID SLOWLY LOITERING ON MEANWHILE
5339-14134-0049 GEARIN AND A AN FOLK IS TALKIN ON A NEW KIND O MAK AND IF THOU'S BOUND FOR YORK I'M NOT GOING BY YORK I'M GOING BY A NEWCASTLE SMACK NEWCASSEL

5339-14134-0052 BRUNTON SELLS CHEESE AND THAT'S NO BETTER PHILIP PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST AND TO WRITE WORD TO ROBSON WHO SATISFIED WITH HIS WILLINGNESS TO UNDERTAKE THE COMMISSION BADE HIM GO ON AND SEE IF HE COULD NOT FIND THE LASS
5339-14134-0054 GLITTERING ICEBERGS BEARING MERCILESSLY DOWN ON THE URANIA NOR SHUDDERING ANTICIPATION OF THE DARK WAVES OF EVIL IMPORT CROSSED HER MIND HE LOVED HER AND THAT WAS ENOUGH HER EYES LOOKED TRANCE LIKE INTO A DIM GLORIOUS FUTURE OF LIFE
5339-14134-0055 HER LIPS STILL WARM AND REDDENED BY HIS KISS WERE JUST PARTED IN A HAPPY SMILE WHEN SHE WAS STARTLED BY THE SOUND OF AN APPROACHING FOOTSTEP A FOOTSTEP QUITE FAMILIAR ENOUGH FOR HER TO RECOGNIZE IT AND WHICH WAS UNWELCOME NOW
5339-14134-0057 BUT SHE TURNED IT OFF WITH ASSUMED LIGHTNESS OH YES
5339-14134-0058 PENITENTLY AS IF ANXIOUS TO BE FORGIVEN SYLVIA DID NOT WANT HIS PENITENCE DID NOT CARE FOR HER RIBBON WAS TROUBLED BY HIS EARNESTNESS OF MANNER BUT HE KNEW NOTHING OF ALL THAT HE ONLY KNEW
5339-14134-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE REPROACHED HIM IF ONLY IN JEST FOR HIS CARELESSNESS AS IT WAS SHE SCARCELY TOOK IN THE SENSE OF HIS WORDS
5339-14134-0061 HE PAUSED A LITTLE SYLVIA'S GALLOPING THOUGHTS WERE PULLED SUDDENLY UP BY HIS SILENCE SHE FELT THAT HE WANTED HER TO SAY SOMETHING BUT SHE COULD THINK OF NOTHING BESIDES AN AMBIGUOUS WELL
5339-14134-0063 NOTHING MORE AS PHILIP'S INSTINCT TOLD HIM BUT HE REASONED THAT FIRST CORRECT IMPRESSION AWAY WITH INGENIOUS SOPHISTRY NOT TO LIVE THERE ONLY TO STAY FOR SOME TIME
5339-14134-0064 SUDDENLY A LIGHT SHONE DOWN INTO PHILIP'S MIND HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED AS HE SPOKE NEXT
5339-14134-0066 THAT THE HALF OF SOME SILVER COIN WAS AMONG THE CONTENTS THUS TURNED OVER BEFORE THE BOX WAS LOCKED BUT THY MOTHER WOULDN'T LIKE IT SYLVIE HE'S PLAYED FALSE WI OTHER LASSES HE'LL BE PLAYING THEE FALSE SOME O THESE DAYS IF THOU LETS HIM COME ABOUT THEE

5339-14134-0073 AT LENGTH HE RAISED HIS STIFFENED BODY AND STOOD UP DIZZY UP THE LITTLE WOODEN STAIRS HE WENT WHERE HE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE TO THE SMALL SQUARE LANDING ALMOST FILLED UP WITH THE GREAT CHEST FOR OAT CAKE HE BREATHED HARD FOR A MINUTE AND THEN KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF SYLVIA'S ROOM
5339-14134-0075 I SHALL BE A LONG TIME AWAY PERHAPS I MAY NIVER COME BACK AT ALL HERE HE BITTERLY THOUGHT OF AN UNREGARDED DEATH SAY GOOD BY NO ANSWER HE WAITED PATIENTLY CAN SHE BE WEARIED OUT AND GONE TO SLEEP HE WONDERED YET ONCE AGAIN
5339-14134-0076 AND GOD BLESS YO I'M SORRY I VEXED YO NO REPLY WITH A HEAVY HEAVY HEART HE CREAKED DOWN THE STAIRS FELT FOR HIS CAP AND LEFT THE HOUSE
5339-14134-0078 AND TOUCHED HER PRIDE MAYBE TOO
5339-14134-0079 AND I'LL BE HOME AGAIN AS SOON AS IVER I CAN IN HALF A YEAR SUCH AS HE FORGETS IF IVER HE'S THOUGHT SERIOUS ABOUT HER BUT IN A MY LIFETIME IF I LIVE TO FOURSCORE I CAN NIVER FORGET
5390-24512-0001 WHEN OUR MESSIAH COMES HE WILL BE A GREAT WARRIOR THEY SAID HE WILL UTTERLY DESTROY ALL OUR ENEMIES HE WILL MAKE JERUSALEM THE GREATEST AND RICHEST CITY
5390-24512-0002 HAD JESUS OF NAZARETH BEEN WILLING TO BECOME THEIR EARTHLY KING AND TO LEAD THE NATION AGAINST THE ROMANS THE JEWS WOULD PROBABLY HAVE FOLLOWED HIM TO A MAN
5390-24512-0004 SHOWED THEM THE RIGHT ATTITUDE IN WHICH TO REGARD THE ROMAN RULE
5390-24512-0005 THE ROMAN GOVERNMENT HAD NO QUARREL WITH HIM THINE OWN NATION HATH DELIVERED THEE UNTO ME
5390-24512-0007 TO CRUCIFY JESUS OF NAZARETH AND TO FREE BARABBAS BUT IN CHOOSING THE REBEL BARABBAS
5390-24512-0008 AS THEIR HERO THE NATION STARTED ON THEIR DOWNWARD ROAD AS THE STORY OF THE FORTY YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED THE SAVIOUR'S CRUCIFIXION CLEARLY SHOWS FOR THE JEWS WERE DETERMINED AT ALL COSTS TO THROW OFF THE ROMAN YOKE
5390-24512-0010 YET THE KEENER THE SUFFERING THE MORE DESPERATE THE JEWS BECAME THEIR WHOLE SOULS WERE POSSESSED WITH A WILD AND MAD PASSION FOR REVENGE
5390-24512-0011 THEN IF ANY MAN SHALL SAY UNTO YOU LO HERE IS CHRIST OR THERE BELIEVE IT NOT MATTHEW
5390-24512-0013 WHERE THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WERE QUARTERED AND CRIED OUT TO THE GARRISON WITHIN THAT THEIR LIVES SHOULD BE SPARED IF THEY WOULD LAY DOWN THEIR WEAPONS THE ROMAN SOLDIERS HESITATED BUT THE JEWS PROMISED MOST FAITHFULLY TO KEEP THEIR WORD
5390-24512-0014 THE ROMANS BELIEVED THEM AND OPENED THEIR GATES BUT NO SOONER WERE THEY IN THE POWER OF THE JEWISH MOB THAN THEY WERE FALLEN UPON AND MURDERED TO THE LAST MAN AS THEY DIED THE ROMAN SOLDIERS WHOM NOT EVEN DEATH COULD TERRIFY
5390-24512-0016 AND HE SENT A GREAT ARMY AGAINST JERUSALEM THE JEWS SHUT THE GATES OF THEIR CITY AND SO BEGAN THE AWFUL SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND WHEN YE SHALL SEE JERUSALEM COMPASSED WITH ARMIES
5390-24512-0017 HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE ROMAN CAMP DURING THE SIEGE OF JERUSALEM AND HE WATCHED WITH DISMAY THE GREAT BATTERING RAMS AND WAR ENGINES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALLS OF THE HOLY CITY HIS EARS RANG WITH THE CRIES OF RAGE AND DESPAIR WHICH BROKE FROM THE JEWS WITHIN
5390-24512-0019 THAT MOTHERS EVEN SNATCHED THE BREAD FROM THEIR OWN CHILDREN'S MOUTHS LOOK OVER THE WALLS O PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM THE ROMAN SOLDIERS ARE CRUCIFYING ALL THE PRISONERS THEY HAVE TAKEN AND THE LINE OF CROSSES IS AS LONG AS OUR CITY IS WIDE
5390-24512-0020 HARD MERCILESS AS WAS THE ROMAN GENERAL EVEN HE GREW SICK WITH HORROR AT LAST AND HE SENT HIS JEWISH PRISONER JOSEPHUS TO THE JEWS PROMISING THEM THEIR LIVES IF THEY WOULD GIVE UP THE CITY
5390-24512-0022 AH MY COUNTRYMEN HE CRIED WE DID NOTHING WITHOUT GOD IN THE PAST BUT NOW YOU ARE FIGHTING AGAINST HIM HAD GOD JUDGED YOU WORTHY OF FREEDOM HE WOULD HAVE PUNISHED THE ROMANS AS HE DID THE ASSYRIANS LONG AGO
5390-24512-0023 EVEN A JEW WHO HAD NO FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST COULD SEE PLAINLY THAT THE ANCIENT POWER AND GLORY OF HIS NATION HAD GONE AT LAST THE END CAME THE FIRST WALL FELL
5390-24512-0025 PILLARS FELL BEAMS CRUMBLED TO ASHES WHILE ROUND THE ALTAR OF SACRIFICE THE PEOPLE OF JERUSALEM LAY HEAPED TOGETHER SLAIN IN SUCH NUMBERS IN THE HOLY PLACE THAT THEIR BLOOD FLOWED DOWN THE BROAD MARBLE STEPS IN A HEAVY CRIMSON STREAM
5390-24512-0026 AND THE GOLDEN CANDLESTICK AND THE BOOK OF THE LAW WERE CARRIED AWAY IN TRIUMPH INTO HEATHEN ROME ALAS FOR THE HOLY CITY OVER WHICH THE SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD HAD STOOD AND WEPT FORTY YEARS BEFORE
5390-24512-0028 SO THE ROMAN CONQUERORS OF JERUSALEM AGREED AND FROM THAT DAY ONWARD THE JEWISH PEOPLE HAVE HAD NO COUNTRY OF THEIR OWN THEY HAVE INDEED BEEN LED AWAY CAPTIVE INTO ALL NATIONS
5390-24512-0029 EXACTLY AS THE LORD FORETOLD THERE IS SCARCELY A COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHERE JEWS MAY NOT BE FOUND BUT JERUSALEM LIES STILL IN THE HANDS OF STRANGERS AND IS THE PROPERTY OF THE TURKISH NATION
5390-24512-0031 THEY ALLOWED THE JEWISH TEACHERS TO CONTINUE THE SYNAGOGUE SERVICES IN OTHER PARTS OF PALESTINE AND TO TEACH IN THEIR COLLEGES THE MOST FAMOUS JEWISH COLLEGE OF THESE DAYS WAS AT TIBERIUS ON THE SHORES OF THE SEA OF GALILEE
5390-24512-0032 OVER WHOSE CLEAR DEPTHS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST HAD SAILED SO OFTEN AND BESIDE WHOSE SHORES HE HAD DONE SO MANY WONDERFUL DEEDS OF LOVE AND MERCY A GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE IT WAS WITH BROAD TERRACED GARDENS
5390-24512-0034 THAT THEY DECLARED A MAN TO BE A BLOCKHEAD IF HE KNEW ONLY THE SCRIPTURES AND NOT THE TALMUD EXPLANATION THE LAW OF MOSES IS LIKE SALT BUT THE TALMUD IS BALMY SPICE THEY WOULD SAY
5390-24512-0035 YET ALTHOUGH THEY HEEDED SO LITTLE THE TRUE MEANING OF GOD'S BOOK THEY GUARDED ITS WORDS MORE AND MORE CAREFULLY AND THE RULES FOR COPYING ANY PORTION OF THE HOLY BOOKS WERE STRICT INDEED MY SON AN OLD TEACHER WOULD SAY TO HIS PUPIL
5390-24512-0037 THAT IS CLEAN ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF MOSES THE INK YOU WRITE WITH MUST BE OF A PURE BLACK MADE ONLY FROM A MIXTURE OF SOOT CHARCOAL AND HONEY
5390-24512-0038 THOUGH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE BOOK OF THE LAW BY HEART YOU MUST NOT WRITE A SINGLE WORD FROM MEMORY BUT RAISE YOUR EYES TO YOUR COPY AND PRONOUNCE THE WORD ALOUD BEFORE TRUSTING IT TO YOUR PEN
5390-24512-0040 THAT COPY MUST BE DESTROYED NOT SATISFIED WITH ALL THESE DIRECTIONS THE MASTER TAUGHT HIS SCHOLAR TO COUNT THE LETTERS OF EVERY BOOK
5390-24512-0041 IS THE MIDDLE LETTER OF ALL THE FIVE BOOKS OF MOSES
5390-24512-0043 IS THE VERY CENTRE OF ALL THE VERSES THE LETTER A THAT IS THE HEBREW LETTER WHICH STANDS FOR A OCCURS FORTY TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN TIMES THE LETTER B THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN
5390-24512-0044 AND SO ON NOT ONLY THIS BUT EVERY SCRIBE WAS REQUIRED TO KNOW FROM MEMORY EXACTLY HOW MANY LETTERS OF EACH KIND THERE SHOULD BE IN HIS SHEET BEFORE HE BEGAN TO WRITE EVERY SHEET OF PARCHMENT MUST CONTAIN AN EQUAL NUMBER OF LINES
5390-24512-0046 HOW TEDIOUS AND MEANINGLESS SUCH INFORMATION APPEARS OF WHAT VALUE WERE ALL THESE DETAILS TO SPEND ALL HIS DAYS IN LEARNING SUCH THINGS AS THESE COULD HAVE NO INFLUENCE ON A MAN'S CHARACTER NOR MAKE HIM A POWER FOR GOOD IN THE WORLD
5390-24512-0047 NOT FOR THIS PURPOSE HAD GOD REVEALED HIS WILL TO MAN SOME YEARS AGO IN THE COFFIN OF AN EGYPTIAN MUMMY A LITTLE JAR OF WHEAT WAS FOUND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS IT HAD LAIN THERE SHUT UP IN THE DARK
5390-24512-0049 JUST SO WAS IT WITH THE HEBREW COPIES OF GOD'S WORD LOCKED UP IN A DEAD LANGUAGE KEPT CLOSE AWAY FROM THE WORLD THEY WERE LIKE THE JAR OF WHEAT WHICH COULD NOT GROW
5390-30096-0000 CHAPTER ONE UNCLE JOHN'S FARM HOW DID I HAPPEN TO OWN A FARM ASKED UNCLE JOHN INTERRUPTING HIS SOUP LONG ENOUGH TO FIX AN INQUIRING GLANCE UPON MAJOR DOYLE WHO SAT OPPOSITE
5390-30096-0002 DO YOU DO THAT EXCLAIMED MISS PATRICIA DOYLE WHO SAT BETWEEN HER UNCLE AND FATHER AND KEPT AN ACTIVE EYE UPON BOTH SO THE MAJOR SAYS ANSWERED UNCLE JOHN DRYLY AND IT'S TRUE
5390-30096-0003 ASSERTED THE OTHER HE'S ASSISTED THREE OR FOUR SCORE YOUNG MEN TO START IN BUSINESS IN THE LAST YEAR TO MY CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE BY LENDING THEM SUMS RANGING FROM ONE TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS
5390-30096-0005 WITHOUT CAPITAL YOU KNOW MANY A YOUNG FELLOW WOULD NEVER GET HIS FOOT ON THE FIRST ROUND OF THE LADDER AND MANY WILL NEVER GET IT THERE IN ANY EVENT DECLARED THE MAJOR WITH A SHAKE OF HIS GRIZZLED HEAD
5390-30096-0006 AND HOW CAN I TELL WHETHER THEY'RE DESARVING OR NOT RETORTED MAJOR DOYLE FIERCELY DO YE WANT ME TO BECOME A SLEUTH OR ENGAGE DETECTIVES TO TRACK THE OBJECTS OF YOUR ERRONEOUS PHILANTHROPY
5390-30096-0008 BUT SOME OF THEM MUST SUCCEED VENTURED PATSY IN A CONCILIATORY TONE SOME DO SAID JOHN MERRICK AND THAT REPAYS ME FOR ALL MY TROUBLE
5390-30096-0009 QUERIED THE MAJOR YOU MANE ALL MY THROUBLE WELL AND YOUR MONEY
5390-30096-0011 OF HIS FALLING DOWN AND WORSHIPING HIM JOHN MERRICK WAS A MULTI MILLIONAIRE TO BE SURE BUT THERE WERE PALLIATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ALMOST EXCUSED HIM HE HAD BEEN SO BUSILY OCCUPIED IN INDUSTRY
5390-30096-0012 THAT HE NEVER NOTICED HOW HIS WEALTH WAS PILING UP UNTIL HE DISCOVERED IT BY ACCIDENT THEN HE PROMPTLY RETIRED TO GIVE THE OTHER FELLOWS A CHANCE AND HE NOW DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO SIMPLE ACTS OF CHARITY
5390-30096-0014 SIMPLE IN HIS TASTES MODEST AND RETIRING LACKING THE EDUCATION AND REFINEMENTS OF POLITE SOCIETY BUT SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED IN THE AFFAIRS OF THE WORLD THE LITTLE MAN FOUND HIS GREATEST ENJOYMENT IN THE FAMILY CIRCLE
5390-30096-0015 THAT HE HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN FOUNDING BEING NO LONGER ABSORBED IN BUSINESS HE HAD COME TO DETEST ITS EVERY DETAIL AND SO ALLOWED HIS BANKERS TO CARE FOR HIS FORTUNE AND HIS BROTHER IN LAW TO DISBURSE HIS INCOME
5390-30096-0017 PATRICIA WAS THE APPLE OF UNCLE JOHN'S EYE AND THE ONE GODDESS ENSHRINED IN HER DOTING FATHER'S HEART GLANCING AT HER
5390-30096-0018 IN HER PLAIN MUSLIN GOWN A STRANGER WOULD BE TEMPTED TO WONDER WHY SHE WAS RED HAIRED FRECKLED AS A ROBIN'S EGG PUG NOSED AND WIDE MOUTHED BUT HER BLUE EYES WERE BEAUTIFUL
5390-30096-0020 AND PEOPLE WOULD GAZE LONGER AT HER SMILING LIPS AND DANCING EYES THAN UPON MANY A MORE HANDSOME BUT LESS ATTRACTIVE FACE SHE WAS NEARLY SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD NOT VERY TALL AND HER FORM TO SPEAK CHARITABLY
5390-30096-0021 HE WANTED CAPITAL TO PATENT THE PUMP AND PUT IT ON THE MARKET THE THING LOOKED PRETTY GOOD JOHN SO I LENT HIM A THOUSAND OF YOUR MONEY QUITE RIGHT RETURNED UNCLE JOHN NODDING BUT PRETTY SOON HE CAME BACK WITH A SAD TALE
5390-30096-0023 BUT HE WAS DECENT ABOUT IT AFTER ALL HIS FATHER HAD LEFT HIM A LITTLE FARM AT MILLVILLE HE COULDN'T SAY WHAT IT WAS WORTH BUT THERE WERE SIXTY ACRES AND SOME GOOD BUILDINGS AND HE WOULD DEED IT TO YOU AS SECURITY
5390-30096-0024 IF YOU WOULD LET HIM HAVE THREE THOUSAND MORE SO YOU TOOK THE FARM AND GAVE HIM THE MONEY I DID SIR PERHAPS I AM TO BLAME
5390-30096-0026 HE REPLIED WHAT BECAME OF THE YOUNG MAN ASKED THE GIRL HE'S A COMPETENT CHAUFFEUR AND SO HE WENT TO WORK DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE WHERE IS MILLVILLE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN THOUGHTFULLY SOMEWHERE AT THE NORTH OF THE STATE I BELIEVE
5390-30096-0027 HAVE YOU INVESTIGATED THE FARM AT ALL I LOOKED UP A REAL ESTATE DEALER LIVING AT MILLVILLE AND WROTE HIM ABOUT THE WEGG FARM HE SAID IF ANY ONE WANTED THE PLACE VERY BADLY IT MIGHT SELL FOR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS HUMPH
5390-30096-0029 FOR A TIME HE ATE WITH GREAT DELIBERATION AND REVOLVED AN INTERESTING THOUGHT IN HIS MIND YEARS AGO
5390-30096-0030 BETH IS STILL WITH LOUISE YOU KNOW AND THEY MUST FIND THE CITY DEADLY DULL JUST NOW THE FARM'S THE THING AND THE MAJOR CAN RUN UP TO SEE US FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS IN THE HOT WEATHER AND WE'LL ALL HAVE A GLORIOUS LAZY TIME
5390-30096-0032 YOU TALK AS IF IT WERE A REAL FARM INSTEAD OF A PLACE NO ONE WOULD HAVE AS A GIFT UNCLE JOHN LOOKED SOBER AGAIN ANYONE LIVE ON THE PLACE MAJOR HE INQUIRED
5390-30096-0033 IT'S GONE TO RUIN AND DECAY THE LAST FEW YEARS
5390-30102-0001 LED A MERE BUTTERFLY EXISTENCE HER TWO COUSINS FRANKLY AGREED THAT LOUISE WAS SHALLOW INSINCERE AND INCLINED TO BE AFFECTED BUT OF THE THREE GIRLS
5390-30102-0002 AND MEN USUALLY ADMIRED HER GRACEFUL FIGURE AND HER PIQUANT PRETTY FACE WITH ITS CROWN OF FLUFFY BLONDE HAIR AND WINNING EXPRESSION THERE WAS A RUMOR THAT SHE WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED TO ARTHUR WELDON
5390-30102-0004 AND THE INCONSEQUENT HOME ENVIRONMENTS THE GIRL WAS MORE UNAFFECTED AND NATURAL IN HER WAYS AND HER FAULTS WERE DOUBTLESS MORE THE RESULT OF EDUCATION THAN OF NATURAL TENDENCY ONE THING WAS INDISPUTABLE HOWEVER
5390-30102-0005 LOUISE MERRICK WAS A CLEVER GIRL POSSESSING A QUICK INTELLECT AND A KEEN INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER OF OTHERS HER APPARENT SHALLOWNESS WAS A BLIND OF THE SAME CHARACTER AS HER ASSUMED GRACIOUSNESS
5390-30102-0007 AND ADMIRED OR LIKED RATHER THAN LOVED THEIR COUSIN UNCLE JOHN THOUGHT HE KNEW HER TOO AND WAS VERY PROUD OF HIS ELDEST NIECE IN SPITE OF SOME DISCOVERED QUALITIES THAT WERE NOT WHOLLY ADMIRABLE
5390-30102-0008 AN EXTENSIVE COURSE OF LIGHT LITERATURE NOT VOID OF DETECTIVE STORIES HAD AT THIS MOMENT PRIMED LOUISE WITH ITS INFLUENCE TO THE EXTENT OF INDUCING HER TO SCENT A MYSTERY IN THE HISTORY OF CAPTAIN WEGG
5390-30102-0010 WERE NEARLY FORGOTTEN IN THE COMMUNITY AND SOON WOULD BE FORGOTTEN ALTOGETHER UNLESS THE QUICK EAR OF A YOUNG GIRL HAD CAUGHT THE CLUE SO LONG IGNORED AT FIRST SHE SCARCELY APPRECIATED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
5390-30102-0011 IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT AN EFFORT TO READ TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA CAPTAIN'S ROMANCE WOULD BE A CHARMING DIVERSION WHILE SHE RESIDED AT MILLVILLE AND IN UNDERTAKING THE TASK SHE LAUGHINGLY ACCUSED HERSELF OF BECOMING AN AMATEUR DETECTIVE
5390-30102-0013 LOUISE SET TO WORK TO TABULATE THE INFORMATION SHE HAD RECEIVED THUS FAR NOTING THE ELEMENT OF MYSTERY EACH FACT EVOLVED FIRST CAPTAIN WEGG MUST HAVE BEEN A RICH MAN IN ORDER TO BUILD THIS HOUSE
5390-30102-0014 SECONDLY THE CAPTAIN A SURLY AND SILENT MAN HAD BROUGHT HITHER PERHAPS BY FORCE A YOUNG WOMAN AS HIS WIFE WHO WAS SO UNHAPPY THAT SHE PINED AWAY AND DIED WHO WAS THIS WOMAN
5390-30102-0016 THE BOY FLED AND LEFT HIS SWEETHEART WITHOUT A WORD WHY UNLESS SOMETHING HAD OCCURRED THAT RENDERED THEIR MARRIAGE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE FIFTH PLACE THERE WAS OLD HUCKS AND HIS BLIND WIFE TO BE CONSIDERED
5390-30102-0017 WHAT DID THEY KNOW ABOUT THEIR OLD MASTER'S SECRET HISTORY WHAT TRAGIC MEMORIES LURKED BENEATH THE MAN'S PERPETUAL SMILE AND THE WOMAN'S COMPOSED AND SIGHTLESS FACE SURELY THERE WAS ENOUGH HERE TO EXCITE THE CURIOSITY
5390-30102-0019 AND ETHEL THOMPSON THE SCHOOL TEACHER THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS BUT ONE OR ANOTHER OF THESE FOUR MUST KNOW THE TRUTH AND IT WOULD BE HER PLEASANT DUTY TO OBTAIN A FULL DISCLOSURE SO SHE WAS ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HER INVESTIGATIONS AT ONCE
5390-30102-0020 WHEN HER UNCLE RETURNED FROM HIS VISIT TO THE PIGS LOUISE SAID TO HIM I'VE BEEN THINKING DEAR THAT WE OUGHT TO CALL UPON THAT YOUNG LADY WHO ARRANGED OUR ROOMS AND THANK HER FOR HER KINDNESS THAT'S TRUE HE REPLIED
5390-30102-0022 WHEN PATSY AND BETH WILL BE ABLE TO MEET HER THAT'S A GOOD IDEA LOUISE I WAS WONDERING WHAT I'D DO THIS MORNING TELL OLD HUCKS TO GET THE NAG HARNESSED THE GIRL RAN EAGERLY UPON HER ERRAND
5390-30102-0023 BUT HE TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO HARNESS THE HORSE LOUISE STOOD WATCHING HIM YOUR FINGERS ARE QUITE NIMBLE THOMAS CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT YOU WERE ONCE A SAILOR SHE SAID BUT SAILORS HAVE TO BE NIMBLE MISS HE RETURNED
5390-30102-0025 DON'T JERK THE BIT FER HIS MOUTH'S TENDER AN IT MAKES HIM BALKY EF HE BALKS JEST LET HIM REST A TIME AN THEN SPEAK TO HIM DAN AIN'T VICIOUS HE'S JEST ORNERY SHE CLIMBED INTO THE DILAPIDATED OLD BUGGY AND TOOK THE REINS
5390-30102-0026 DAN GROANED AND AMBLED SLOWLY AROUND TO WHERE UNCLE JOHN STOOD AWAITING HIS NIECE
5390-30102-0028 OR WHY SOMEONE DON'T KNOCK HIM ON THE HEAD DAN TURNED HIS LONG LEAN FACE AS IF TO GIVE THE SPEAKER A REPROACHFUL LOOK THEN HE GROANED AGAIN LEANED FORWARD AND DREW THE BUGGY SLOWLY INTO THE STONY LANE
5390-30102-0029 DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE THOMPSONS LIVE INQUIRED UNCLE JOHN NO WHOA DAN THAT WAS THE BEST THING THE NAG DID HE KNEW HOW TO WHOA THOMAS CALLED UNCLE JOHN TURNING IN HIS SEAT
5390-30102-0031 THOMPSON'S STAMMERED HUCKS GLANCING UP AT THEM WITH HIS BRIGHT ELUSIVE SMILE WELL WE'RE GOING ANYHOW GROWLED MISTER MERRICK
5393-19218-0000 THE NIGHT OF THE SIXTEENTH TO THE SEVENTEENTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS A BLESSED NIGHT ABOVE ITS SHADOWS HEAVEN STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE WEDDING NIGHT OF MARIUS AND COSETTE THE DAY HAD BEEN ADORABLE
5393-19218-0002 THE MANNER OF MARRIAGE IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WAS NOT THE SAME AS IT IS TO DAY FRANCE HAD NOT YET BORROWED FROM ENGLAND THAT SUPREME DELICACY OF CARRYING OFF ONE'S WIFE OF FLEEING
5393-19218-0003 ON COMING OUT OF CHURCH OF HIDING ONESELF WITH SHAME FROM ONE'S HAPPINESS AND OF COMBINING THE WAYS OF A BANKRUPT WITH THE DELIGHTS OF THE SONG OF SONGS PEOPLE HAD NOT YET GRASPED TO THE FULL THE CHASTITY EXQUISITENESS

5393-19218-0006 AND RAINING DOWN ON THE POST CHAISE OF THE BRIDAL PAIR A HAIL STORM OF SLIPPERS TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND OF WORN OUT SHOES IN MEMORY OF CHURCHILL
5393-19218-0008 MARRIAGE WAS NOT CONDUCTED AT A FULL TROT STRANGE TO SAY AT THAT EPOCH PEOPLE STILL IMAGINED THAT A WEDDING WAS A PRIVATE AND SOCIAL FESTIVAL THAT A PATRIARCHAL BANQUET DOES NOT SPOIL A DOMESTIC SOLEMNITY THAT GAYETY EVEN IN EXCESS
5393-19218-0009 PROVIDED IT BE HONEST AND DECENT DOES HAPPINESS NO HARM AND THAT IN SHORT IT IS A GOOD AND A VENERABLE THING THAT THE FUSION OF THESE TWO DESTINIES WHENCE A FAMILY IS DESTINED TO SPRING SHOULD BEGIN AT HOME AND THAT THE HOUSEHOLD SHOULD THENCEFORTH
5393-19218-0011 NOW WE NOTE THIS DETAIL FOR THE PURE SATISFACTION OF BEING EXACT IT CHANCED
5393-19218-0012 AS THE MARRIAGE WAS TAKING PLACE UNDER THE REGIME OF COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY THE PAPERS HAD BEEN SIMPLE
5393-19218-0014 NOR EVEN TO SEE HIS HURT NOT EVEN COSETTE NEVERTHELESS THIS HAD FORCED HIM TO SWATHE HIS HAND IN A LINEN BANDAGE AND TO CARRY HIS ARM IN A SLING AND HAD PREVENTED HIS SIGNING M GILLENORMAND
5393-19218-0015 IN HIS CAPACITY OF COSETTE'S SUPERVISING GUARDIAN HAD SUPPLIED HIS PLACE WE WILL NOT CONDUCT THE READER EITHER TO THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OR TO THE CHURCH ONE DOES NOT FOLLOW A PAIR OF LOVERS TO THAT EXTENT
5393-19218-0017 WAS IN PROCESS OF REPAVING IT WAS BARRED OFF

5393-19218-0027 NEARLY AT THE SAME MOMENT THE OTHER FILE WHICH WAS PROCEEDING TOWARDS THE MADELEINE HALTED ALSO AT THAT POINT OF THE FILE THERE WAS A CARRIAGE LOAD OF MASKERS THESE CARRIAGES OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY THESE WAGON LOADS OF MASKERS
5393-19218-0029 TOW WIGS PINK TIGHTS DANDIFIED HATS SPECTACLES OF A GRIMACER

5393-19219-0055 AND TO TAKE AWAY FROM US AND PUT BACK IN HIS BOX
5393-19219-0057 THERE WAS A TUMULT THEN SILENCE THE MARRIED PAIR DISAPPEARED A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT
5393-19219-0058 HERE WE PAUSE ON THE THRESHOLD OF WEDDING NIGHTS STANDS A SMILING ANGEL WITH HIS FINGER ON HIS LIPS THE SOUL ENTERS INTO CONTEMPLATION BEFORE THAT SANCTUARY WHERE THE CELEBRATION OF LOVE TAKES PLACE THERE SHOULD BE FLASHES OF LIGHT ATHWART SUCH HOUSES
5393-19219-0060 DAZZLED WITH VOLUPTUOUSNESS AND BELIEVING THEMSELVES ALONE WERE TO LISTEN THEY WOULD HEAR IN THEIR CHAMBER A CONFUSED RUSTLING OF WINGS PERFECT HAPPINESS IMPLIES A MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WITH THE ANGELS THAT DARK LITTLE CHAMBER HAS ALL HEAVEN FOR ITS CEILING
5393-19219-0061 WHEN TWO MOUTHS RENDERED SACRED BY LOVE APPROACH TO CREATE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THERE SHOULD NOT BE ABOVE THAT INEFFABLE KISS A QUIVERING THROUGHOUT THE IMMENSE MYSTERY OF STARS THESE FELICITIES ARE THE TRUE ONES
5456-24741-0000 THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES
5456-24741-0001 PROOF ALL THE MODES IN WHICH ANY GIVEN BODY IS AFFECTED
5456-24741-0003 THEREFORE THE IDEA OF EVERY MODE IN WHICH THE HUMAN BODY IS AFFECTED BY EXTERNAL BODIES INVOLVES THE NATURE OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0004 HENCE IT FOLLOWS FIRST THAT THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THE NATURE OF A VARIETY OF BODIES TOGETHER WITH THE NATURE OF ITS OWN
5456-24741-0006 IN OTHER WORDS IT WILL HAVE THE IDEA WHICH DOES NOT EXCLUDE BUT POSTULATES THE EXISTENCE OR PRESENCE OF THE NATURE OF THE EXTERNAL BODY
5456-24741-0007 WILL REGARD THE EXTERNAL BODY AS ACTUALLY EXISTING
5456-24741-0009 BY WHICH THE HUMAN BODY HAS ONCE BEEN AFFECTED BE NO LONGER IN EXISTENCE THE MIND WILL NEVERTHELESS REGARD THEM AS PRESENT AS OFTEN AS THIS ACTION OF THE BODY IS REPEATED
5456-24741-0010 NOTE WE THUS SEE HOW IT COMES ABOUT
5456-24741-0012 THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY OF WHICH THE IDEAS REPRESENT EXTERNAL BODIES AS PRESENT TO US WE WILL CALL THE IMAGES OF THINGS THOUGH THEY DO NOT RECALL THE FIGURE OF THINGS WHEN THE MIND REGARDS BODIES IN THIS FASHION WE SAY THAT IT IMAGINES
5456-24741-0013 LOOKED AT IN THEMSELVES DO NOT CONTAIN ERROR THE MIND DOES NOT ERR IN THE MERE ACT OF IMAGINING BUT ONLY IN SO FAR AS IT IS REGARDED AS BEING WITHOUT THE IDEA
5456-24741-0015 IDEAS OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE HUMAN BODY ARE STRICTLY SPEAKING
5456-24741-0016 THOSE WHICH INVOLVE THE NATURE BOTH OF THE HUMAN BODY AND OF EXTERNAL BODIES I SAY SECONDLY
5456-24741-0018 WHEREBY THE MIND PERCEIVES THINGS THROUGH THEIR PRIMARY CAUSES
5456-24741-0019 AND HENCE WE CAN FURTHER CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHY THE MIND FROM THE THOUGHT OF ONE THING SHOULD STRAIGHTWAY ARRIVE AT THE THOUGHT OF ANOTHER THING WHICH HAS NO SIMILARITY WITH THE FIRST FOR INSTANCE FROM THE THOUGHT OF THE WORD POMUM AN APPLE
5456-24741-0021 THAT IS THAT THE MAN HAS OFTEN HEARD THE WORD POMUM WHILE HE WAS LOOKING AT THE FRUIT
5456-24741-0022 OR THE HUMAN MIND PERCEIVES THOSE MODIFICATIONS
5456-24741-0024 FOLLOWING IN GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AND BEING REFERRED TO GOD IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE IDEA OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN BODY PROOF

5456-62043-0030 IT APPEARS THE TWO PASSENGERS IN THEIR FIRST LESSON HAD INCIDENTALLY LOST ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY DOLLARS THE CAPTAIN AS HE ROSE TO SEE ABOUT TAKING IN SOME GOOD WOOD WHICH HE FELT SURE OF OBTAINING NOW THAT HE HAD GOT ABOVE THE LEVEL COUNTRY WINKED AT HIS OPPONENT
5456-62043-0032 THERE WAS JUST FOG ENOUGH TO PREVENT THE VISION TAKING IN MORE THAN SIXTY YARDS SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN MY EXPECTATION WE WERE NEARING THE SHORE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LOOKING FOR WOOD THE BANKS BEING INVISIBLE FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE IT IS EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN STOP HER
5456-62043-0033 AND THE CAPTAIN HAILED HALLO THE WOODYARD HALLO YOURSELF ANSWERED A SQUEAKING FEMALE VOICE WHICH CAME FROM A WOMAN WITH A PETTICOAT OVER HER SHOULDERS IN PLACE OF A SHAWL WHAT'S THE PRICE OF WOOD
5456-62043-0035 AND NOW YOU KNOW IT THREE AND THE D L BROKE IN THE CAPTAIN WHAT HAVE YOU RAISED ON YOUR WOOD TOO I'LL GIVE YOU THREE AND NOT A CENT MORE WELL REPLIED THE PETTICOAT HERE COMES THE OLD MAN HE'LL TALK TO YOU AND SURE ENOUGH
5456-62043-0036 OUT CREPT FROM THE COTTAGE THE VERITABLE FADED HAT COPPERAS COLORED PANTS YELLOW COUNTENANCE AND TWO WEEKS BEARD WE HAD SEEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
5456-62043-0038 AND TURNED IN TO TAKE SOME REST THE FACT BECAME APPARENT THE READER WILL PROBABLY HAVE DISCOVERED IT SOME TIME SINCE
5463-39173-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE WHY PUCK THE PONY WAS BEATEN MARK ROBARTS RETURNED HOME THE DAY AFTER THE SCENE AT THE ALBANY CONSIDERABLY RELIEVED IN SPIRIT
5463-39173-0002 ON THE DAY AFTER HIS RETURN HE RECEIVED PROPER AUTHENTIC TIDINGS OF HIS PRESENTATION TO THE PREBEND HE WAS IN FACT ALREADY PREBENDARY
5463-39173-0003 THE INCOME WAS ALREADY HIS OWN
5463-39173-0005 AND LUCY'S WARM AND EAGER JOY MADE HIM FEEL QUITE DELIGHTED WITH MISTER SOWERBY AND THE DUKE OF OMNIUM AND THEN THAT SPLENDID ANIMAL DANDY CAME HOME TO THE PARSONAGE STABLES MUCH TO THE DELIGHT OF THE GROOM AND GARDENER
5463-39173-0006 WHICH HE HAD BOUGHT FROM MISTER SOWERBY SOME LITTLE TIME SINCE WITH THE OBJECT OF OBLIGING HIM HE MARK INTENDED TO SELL HIM AGAIN AS SOON AS HE COULD DO SO JUDICIOUSLY THIS AS I HAVE SAID ABOVE WAS NOT SATISFACTORY
5463-39173-0008 AND THAT THE PURCHASING OF A HUNTER WITH THE VIEW OF IMMEDIATELY SELLING HIM AGAIN WAS TO SAY THE LEAST OF IT AN OPERATION HARDLY CONGENIAL WITH THE USUAL TASTES AND PURSUITS OF A CLERGYMAN I HOPE YOU DID NOT GIVE VERY MUCH MONEY FOR HIM MARK SAID FANNY
5463-39173-0009 NOT MORE THAN I SHALL GET AGAIN SAID MARK
5463-39173-0011 THE HOUSE WILL NOT BE FURNISHED WILL IT MARK SAID HIS WIFE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE SHALL GET ON DON'T FRIGHTEN YOURSELVES I SHALL TAKE LODGINGS IN BARCHESTER AND WE SHALL NOT SEE YOU ALL THE TIME SAID MISSUS ROBARTS WITH DISMAY
5463-39173-0012 BUT THE PREBENDARY EXPLAINED THAT HE WOULD BE BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AT FRAMLEY EVERY WEEK AND THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY HE WOULD ONLY SLEEP AT BARCHESTER ON THE SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS AND PERHAPS NOT ALWAYS THEN
5463-39173-0014 IT WAS NOW THE MONTH OF APRIL AND THE FIELDS WERE BEGINNING TO LOOK GREEN AND THE WIND HAD GOT ITSELF OUT OF THE EAST AND WAS SOFT AND GENIAL AND THE EARLY SPRING FLOWERS WERE SHOWING THEIR BRIGHT COLOURS IN THE PARSONAGE GARDEN AND ALL THINGS WERE SWEET AND PLEASANT
5463-39173-0015 WENT AWAY WHEN THE SPRING CAME LEAVING THEIR HOUSES INNOCENT AND EMPTY THE PARISH DUTY WAS BETTER ATTENDED TO AND PERHAPS DOMESTIC DUTIES ALSO AT SUCH PERIOD HE WAS A PATTERN PARSON AND A PATTERN HUSBAND
5463-39173-0017 INDEED JUST AT THIS MOMENT
5463-39173-0018 DANDY WAS RATHER A THORN IN HIS SIDE THOSE WRETCHED BILLS WERE TO COME DUE EARLY IN MAY AND BEFORE THE END OF APRIL SOWERBY WROTE TO HIM SAYING THAT HE WAS DOING HIS UTMOST TO PROVIDE FOR THE EVIL DAY
5463-39173-0020 HASTE AND SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND MEN RUNNING TO AND FRO WITH BLANK ACCEPTANCES IN THEIR HANDS COULD ALONE STAVE OFF THE CRACK OF DOOM BUT AT OTHER TIMES WHEN RETALIATORY APPLICATIONS WERE MADE TO HIM
5463-39173-0021 HE COULD PROVE WITH THE EASIEST VOICE AND MOST JAUNTY MANNER THAT EVERYTHING WAS QUITE SERENE NOW AT THIS PERIOD HE WAS IN THAT MOOD OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORTS AND HE CALLED LOUDLY FOR THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY POUNDS FOR DANDY AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED
5463-39173-0023 SHE HAD DECLARED TO HIM PLAINLY THAT SHE DID NOT LOVE HIM AND COULD NOT LOVE HIM AND HAD THUS THROWN AWAY NOT ONLY RICHES AND HONOUR AND HIGH STATION BUT MORE THAN THAT MUCH WORSE THAN THAT SHE HAD FLUNG AWAY FROM HER THE LOVER TO WHOSE LOVE HER WARM HEART CLUNG
5463-39173-0024 THAT HER LOVE DID CLING TO HIM SHE KNEW EVEN THEN AND OWNED MORE THOROUGHLY AS SOON AS HE WAS GONE SO MUCH HER PRIDE HAD DONE FOR HER AND THAT STRONG RESOLVE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD NOT SCOWL ON HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE HAD ENTRAPPED HER SON
5463-39173-0026 BUT WHAT WOULD THE WORLD COME TO IF NONE BUT ABSOLUTE TRUE HEROES WERE TO BE THOUGHT WORTHY OF WOMEN'S LOVE WHAT WOULD THE MEN DO AND WHAT OH WHAT WOULD BECOME OF THE WOMEN
5463-39173-0027 LUCY ROBARTS IN HER HEART DID NOT GIVE HER DISMISSED LOVER CREDIT FOR MUCH MORE HEROISM THAN DID TRULY APPERTAIN TO HIM DID NOT PERHAPS GIVE HIM FULL CREDIT FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF HEROISM WHICH DID REALLY APPERTAIN TO HIM
5463-39173-0029 BUT A TITLE AND AN ESTATE AND AN INCOME ARE MATTERS WHICH WILL WEIGH IN THE BALANCE WITH ALL EVE'S DAUGHTERS AS THEY DO WITH ALL ADAM'S SONS PRIDE OF PLACE AND THE POWER OF LIVING WELL IN FRONT OF THE WORLD'S EYE ARE DEAR TO US ALL ARE DOUBTLESS INTENDED TO BE DEAR
5463-39173-0030 THE MISTRESS OF SUCH A DESTINY WHAT MORE OR WHAT BETTER COULD THE WORLD HAVE DONE FOR HER AND NOW SHE HAD THROWN ALL THAT ASIDE BECAUSE SHE WOULD NOT ENDURE THAT LADY LUFTON SHOULD CALL HER A SCHEMING ARTFUL GIRL ACTUATED BY THAT FEAR SHE HAD REPULSED HIM WITH A FALSEHOOD
5463-39173-0032 IT WAS WHEN SHE WAS QUITE ALONE AT NIGHT IN HER OWN ROOM OR IN HER SOLITARY WALKS THAT A SINGLE SILENT TEAR WOULD GATHER IN THE CORNER OF HER EYE AND GRADUALLY MOISTEN HER EYELIDS SHE NEVER TOLD HER LOVE NOR DID SHE ALLOW CONCEALMENT TO FEED ON HER DAMASK CHEEK
5463-39173-0033 IN ALL HER EMPLOYMENTS IN HER WAYS ABOUT THE HOUSE AND HER ACCUSTOMED QUIET MIRTH SHE WAS THE SAME AS EVER IN THIS SHE SHOWED THE PECULIAR STRENGTH WHICH GOD HAD GIVEN HER BUT NOT THE LESS DID SHE IN TRUTH MOURN FOR HER LOST LOVE AND SPOILED AMBITION
5463-39173-0035 THE PONY CARRIAGE IS WRETCHED FOR THREE OH AS FOR THAT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THE NEW HORSE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CARRY YOU AS FAR AS THAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO SEE MISTER CRAWLEY SO I DO AND THE NEW HORSE AS YOU CALL HIM SHALL CARRY ME THERE TO MORROW
5463-39173-0036 WILL YOU SAY THAT I'LL BE OVER ABOUT TWELVE O'CLOCK YOU HAD BETTER SAY EARLIER AS HE IS ALWAYS OUT ABOUT THE PARISH VERY WELL SAY ELEVEN IT IS PARISH BUSINESS ABOUT WHICH I AM GOING SO IT NEED NOT IRK HIS CONSCIENCE TO STAY IN FOR ME
5463-39173-0038 NOT A WORD HAD BEEN SPOKEN BETWEEN THEM ABOUT LORD LUFTON SINCE THAT EVENING NOW MORE THAN A MONTH AGO ON WHICH THEY HAD BEEN WALKING TOGETHER IN THE GARDEN LUCY HAD SO DEMEANED HERSELF ON THAT OCCASION
5463-39173-0039 AS TO MAKE HER SISTER IN LAW QUITE SURE THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO LOVE PASSAGES UP TO THAT TIME AND NOTHING HAD SINCE OCCURRED WHICH HAD CREATED ANY SUSPICION IN MISSUS ROBARTS MIND SHE HAD SEEN AT ONCE THAT ALL THE CLOSE INTIMACY BETWEEN THEM WAS OVER AND THOUGHT THAT EVERYTHING WAS AS IT SHOULD BE
5463-39173-0041 BUT YOU SEE WHEN ONE IS TRUSTED WITH A WHIP ONE FEELS SUCH A LONGING TO USE IT OH BUT YOU SHOULD KEEP IT STILL I FEEL ALMOST CERTAIN THAT LADY LUFTON WOULD LIKE SUCH A MATCH I DARESAY SHE MIGHT MISS GRANTLY WILL HAVE A LARGE FORTUNE I BELIEVE
5463-39173-0042 AND THEN SHE IS QUIET AND RESERVED SHE DOES NOT REQUIRE EXCITEMENT AND I AM SURE IS CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HER DUTIES VERY CONSCIENTIOUS I HAVE NO DOUBT SAID LUCY WITH SOMETHING LIKE A SNEER IN HER TONE BUT THE QUESTION I SUPPOSE IS
5463-39173-0044 OH BY GOD'S MERCY VERY LITTLE AS FOR ME I SHALL GET OVER IT IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS I DON'T DOUBT THAT'S IF I CAN GET ASS'S MILK AND CHANGE OF AIR WE'LL TAKE YOU TO BARCHESTER FOR THAT BUT AS I WAS SAYING I REALLY DO THINK LORD LUFTON LIKES GRISELDA GRANTLY
5463-39173-0045 THEN I REALLY DO THINK THAT HE HAS UNCOMMON BAD TASTE SAID LUCY WITH A REALITY IN HER VOICE DIFFERING MUCH FROM THE TONE OF BANTER SHE HAD HITHERTO USED WHAT LUCY SAID HER SISTER IN LAW LOOKING AT HER
5463-39173-0047 TO SIT STILL AND NOT BE ADMIRED WOULD ALMOST SUFFICE FOR HER I DO NOT WORSHIP LADY LUFTON AS YOU DO BUT I THINK QUITE WELL ENOUGH OF HER TO WONDER THAT SHE SHOULD CHOOSE SUCH A GIRL AS THAT FOR HER SON'S WIFE THAT SHE DOES WISH IT I DO NOT DOUBT
5463-39173-0048 BUT I SHALL INDEED BE SURPRISED IF HE WISHES IT ALSO AND THEN AS SHE FINISHED HER SPEECH LUCY AGAIN FLOGGED THE PONY THIS SHE DID IN VEXATION BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT THE TELL TALE BLOOD HAD SUFFUSED HER FACE WHY LUCY
5463-39173-0050 I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IT'S NO USE YOUR LOOKING AT ME FANNY YOU WILL MAKE ME TALK OF IT AND I WON'T TELL A LIE ON THE SUBJECT I DO LIKE LORD LUFTON VERY MUCH AND I DO DISLIKE GRISELDA GRANTLY ALMOST AS MUCH
5463-39173-0051 THEREFORE I SHALL NOT BE SATISFIED IF THEY BECOME MAN AND WIFE HOWEVER
5463-39173-0053 ONE OF THESE WAS NOW ILL WITH CROUP AND IT WAS WITH THE OBJECT OF OFFERING TO THE MOTHER SOME COMFORT AND SOLACE THAT THE PRESENT VISIT WAS MADE THE TWO LADIES GOT DOWN FROM THEIR CARRIAGE HAVING OBTAINED THE SERVICES OF A BOY TO HOLD PUCK AND SOON FOUND THEMSELVES IN MISSUS CRAWLEY'S SINGLE SITTING ROOM
5463-39173-0054 WHICH THEY KNEW IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE IN MISTER CRAWLEY'S PRESENCE SHE AS WE HAVE SAID WAS NOT QUITE SO GAUNT NOT ALTOGETHER SO HAGGARD AS IN THE LATTER OF THOSE DREADFUL CORNISH DAYS LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ARABIN BETWEEN THEM
5463-39173-0056 LIBERAL ACCORDING TO THE SCALE BY WHICH THE INCOMES OF CLERGYMEN IN SOME OF OUR NEW DISTRICTS ARE NOW APPORTIONED WOULD NOT ADMIT OF A GENTLEMAN WITH HIS WIFE AND FOUR CHILDREN LIVING WITH THE ORDINARY COMFORTS OF AN ARTISAN'S FAMILY
5463-39173-0057 AS REGARDS THE MERE EATING AND DRINKING THE AMOUNTS OF BUTCHER'S MEAT AND TEA AND BUTTER THEY OF COURSE WERE USED IN QUANTITIES WHICH ANY ARTISAN WOULD HAVE REGARDED AS COMPATIBLE ONLY WITH DEMI STARVATION BETTER CLOTHING FOR HER CHILDREN WAS NECESSARY AND BETTER CLOTHING FOR HIM
5463-39173-0059 LUCY HAD NEVER SEEN MISSUS CRAWLEY THESE VISITS TO HOGGLESTOCK WERE NOT FREQUENT AND HAD GENERALLY BEEN MADE BY LADY LUFTON AND MISSUS ROBARTS TOGETHER
5463-39173-0060 ALMOST AS PENNILESS AS THE CURATE HIMSELF THEN THEY WOULD WALK TOGETHER FOR HOURS ALONG THE ROCK BOUND SHORE LISTENING TO THE WAVES DISCUSSING DEEP POLEMICAL MYSTERIES SOMETIMES WITH HOT FURY THEN AGAIN WITH TENDER LOVING CHARITY
5463-39173-0062 AND DOCTOR ARABIN HAD PROMISED THAT NO ONE ELSE SHOULD BE IN THE HOUSE IF MISTER CRAWLEY OBJECTED TO SOCIETY BUT THIS WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED THE FINERY AND GRANDEUR OF THE DEANERY AND THE COMFORT OF THAT WARM SNUG LIBRARY WOULD SILENCE HIM AT ONCE
5463-39173-0063 THEN OLD DAYS WOULD HAVE COME BACK TO THEM BUT NOW ARABIN ALWAYS RIDES ON A SLEEK FINE HORSE NOW A DAYS HE ONCE SAID TO HIS WIFE WITH A SNEER
5463-39174-0001 FOR SHE HAD WORK OF THIS KIND OF HER OWN AT HOME WHICH SHE BY NO MEANS NEGLECTED THOUGH THE ATTENDANCE OF NURSES WAS MORE PLENTIFUL WITH HER THAN AT HOGGLESTOCK MISSUS CRAWLEY DID GET UP AND TOLD LUCY THAT SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE HER AND MISTER CRAWLEY CAME FORWARD GRAMMAR IN HAND LOOKING HUMBLE AND MEEK
5463-39174-0002 THE REALITIES OF LIFE HAD BECOME SO STERN TO HER THAT THE OUTWARD ASPECTS OF THEM WERE AS NOTHING SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED A NEW GOWN BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING TO HER IF ALL THE COUNTY KNEW THAT THE ONE IN WHICH SHE WENT TO CHURCH HAD BEEN TURNED THREE TIMES
5463-39174-0004 MOVING A PILE OF RAGGED COVERLESS BOOKS ON TO THE TABLE I HOPE HE'LL FORGIVE ME FOR MOVING THEM THEY ARE NOT BOB'S AT LEAST NOT THE MOST OF THEM BUT MINE SAID THE GIRL BUT SOME OF THEM ARE MINE SAID THE BOY AIN'T THEY GRACE
5463-39174-0005 AND ARE YOU A GREAT SCHOLAR ASKED LUCY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER I DON'T KNOW SAID GRACE WITH A SHEEPISH FACE I AM IN GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS GREEK DELECTUS AND THE IRREGULAR VERBS AND LUCY PUT UP HER HANDS WITH ASTONISHMENT
5463-39174-0007 A LITTLE SCHOLARSHIP IS THE ONLY FORTUNE THAT HAS COME IN MY WAY AND I ENDEAVOUR TO SHARE THAT WITH MY CHILDREN I BELIEVE MEN SAY THAT IT IS THE BEST FORTUNE ANY OF US CAN HAVE SAID LUCY THINKING HOWEVER IN HER OWN MIND
5463-39174-0008 THAT HORACE AND THE IRREGULAR GREEK VERBS SAVOURED TOO MUCH OF PRECOCIOUS FORCING IN A YOUNG LADY OF NINE YEARS OLD BUT NEVERTHELESS GRACE WAS A PRETTY SIMPLE LOOKING GIRL AND CLUNG TO HER ALLY CLOSELY AND SEEMED TO LIKE BEING FONDLED
5463-39174-0010 YES I HAVE HEARD OF IT SAID MISTER CRAWLEY GRAVELY I HOPE THAT HIS PROMOTION MAY TEND IN EVERY WAY TO HIS ADVANTAGE HERE AND HEREAFTER IT SEEMED HOWEVER TO BE MANIFEST FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH HE EXPRESSED HIS KIND WISHES
5463-39174-0011 THAT HIS HOPES AND EXPECTATIONS DID NOT GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER BY THE BY HE DESIRED US TO SAY THAT HE WILL CALL HERE TO MORROW AT ABOUT ELEVEN DIDN'T HE SAY FANNY YES
5463-39174-0013 HIS NEW DUTIES DO NOT DISTURB HIM MUCH AS YET SAID LUCY AND HIS RIDING OVER HERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE TO HIM YES THERE HE HAS THE ADVANTAGE OVER ME I UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NO HORSE
5463-39174-0014 AND THEN LUCY BEGAN PETTING THE LITTLE BOY AND BY DEGREES SLIPPED A SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS OUT OF HER MUFF INTO HIS HANDS SHE HAD NOT THE PATIENCE NECESSARY FOR WAITING AS HAD HER SISTER IN LAW THE BOY TOOK THE BAG PEEPED INTO IT AND THEN LOOKED UP INTO HER FACE
5463-39174-0016 BUT OUR CHILDREN ARE HARDLY USED TO SUCH THINGS
5463-39174-0017 OH CERTAINLY BOB MY CHILD
5463-39174-0019 THIS WAS VERY DISCOURAGING TO LUCY IF ONE SMALL BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS CREATED SO GREAT A DIFFICULTY HOW WAS SHE TO DISPOSE OF THE POT OF GUAVA JELLY AND BOX OF BONBONS WHICH WERE STILL IN HER MUFF OR HOW DISTRIBUTE THE PACKET OF ORANGES WITH WHICH THE PONY CARRIAGE WAS LADEN
5463-39174-0020 AND THERE WAS JELLY FOR THE SICK CHILD AND CHICKEN BROTH WHICH WAS INDEED ANOTHER JELLY AND TO TELL THE TRUTH OPENLY THERE WAS ALSO A JOINT OF FRESH PORK AND A BASKET OF EGGS FROM THE FRAMLEY PARSONAGE FARMYARD WHICH MISSUS ROBARTS WAS TO INTRODUCE SHOULD SHE FIND HERSELF CAPABLE OF DOING SO
5463-39174-0022 LUCY FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO KEEP UP A CONVERSATION WITH MISTER CRAWLEY THE MORE SO AS MISSUS ROBARTS AND MISSUS CRAWLEY PRESENTLY WITHDREW INTO A BEDROOM TAKING THE TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN WITH THEM HOW UNLUCKY THOUGHT LUCY THAT SHE HAS NOT GOT MY MUFF WITH HER
5463-39174-0023 BUT THE MUFF LAY IN HER LAP PONDEROUS WITH ITS RICH ENCLOSURES I SUPPOSE YOU WILL LIVE IN BARCHESTER FOR A PORTION OF THE YEAR NOW SAID MISTER CRAWLEY I REALLY DO NOT KNOW AS YET MARK TALKS OF TAKING LODGINGS FOR HIS FIRST MONTH'S RESIDENCE
5463-39174-0025 IT WAS ON LUCY'S TONGUE TO SAY THAT HER LADYSHIP WAS PRETTY NEARLY AS BAD BUT SHE STOPPED HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT PROVIDENCE SENT GREAT RELIEF TO MISS ROBARTS IN THE SHAPE OF MISSUS CRAWLEY'S RED ARMED MAID OF ALL WORK WHO WALKING UP TO HER MASTER
5463-39174-0026 WHISPERED INTO HIS EAR THAT HE WAS WANTED IT WAS THE TIME OF DAY AT WHICH HIS ATTENDANCE WAS ALWAYS REQUIRED IN HIS PARISH SCHOOL AND THAT ATTENDANCE BEING SO PUNCTUALLY GIVEN THOSE WHO WANTED HIM LOOKED FOR HIM THERE AT THIS HOUR AND IF HE WERE ABSENT DID NOT SCRUPLE TO SEND FOR HIM
5463-39174-0028 AND THEN STICK IN HAND HE WALKED FORTH AND LUCY FANCIED THAT BOBBY'S EYES IMMEDIATELY RESTED ON THE BAG OF GINGERBREAD NUTS BOB SAID SHE ALMOST IN A WHISPER
5463-39174-0029 I HAVE LEFT A BOOK BEHIND ME HE SAID AND COMING BACK THROUGH THE ROOM HE TOOK UP THE WELL WORN PRAYER BOOK WHICH ACCOMPANIED HIM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS THROUGH THE PARISH BOBBY WHEN HE SAW HIS FATHER HAD RETREATED A FEW STEPS BACK AS ALSO DID GRACE WHO TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
5463-39174-0031 BUT THERE ARE MEN MADE OF SUCH STUFF THAT AN ANGEL COULD HARDLY LIVE WITH THEM WITHOUT SOME DECEIT PAPA'S GONE NOW WHISPERED BOBBY I SAW HIM TURN ROUND THE CORNER HE AT ANY RATE HAD LEARNED HIS LESSON AS IT WAS NATURAL THAT HE SHOULD DO
5463-39174-0032 SOME ONE ELSE ALSO HAD LEARNED THAT PAPA WAS GONE FOR WHILE BOB AND GRACE WERE STILL COUNTING THE BIG LUMPS OF SUGAR CANDY EACH EMPLOYED THE WHILE FOR INWARD SOLACE WITH AN INCH OF BARLEY SUGAR THE FRONT DOOR OPENED AND A BIG BASKET AND A BUNDLE DONE UP IN A KITCHEN CLOTH
5463-39174-0034 GOD HAS TRIED US WITH WANT AND FOR MY CHILDREN'S SAKE I AM GLAD OF SUCH RELIEF BUT WILL HE BE ANGRY I WILL MANAGE IT DEAR MISSUS ROBARTS YOU MUST NOT BE SURPRISED AT HIM HIS LOT IS SOMETIMES VERY HARD TO BEAR
5463-39174-0035 SUCH THINGS ARE SO MUCH WORSE FOR A MAN THAN FOR A WOMAN FANNY WAS NOT QUITE PREPARED TO ADMIT THIS IN HER OWN HEART BUT SHE MADE NO REPLY ON THAT HEAD I AM SURE I HOPE WE MAY BE ABLE TO BE OF USE TO YOU SHE SAID IF YOU WILL ONLY LOOK UPON ME AS AN OLD FRIEND AND WRITE TO ME IF YOU WANT ME
5463-39174-0037 THAT ALL THE WORK OF HER MIND SHOULD BE GIVEN UP TO SUCH SUBJECTS AS THESE BUT NEVERTHELESS SHE COULD BEAR IT SHE SAID AS LONG AS HE WOULD CARRY HIMSELF LIKE A MAN AND FACE HIS LOT BOLDLY BEFORE THE WORLD AND THEN SHE TOLD HOW HE HAD BEEN BETTER THERE AT HOGGLESTOCK THAN IN THEIR FORMER RESIDENCE DOWN IN CORNWALL
5463-39174-0038 MISSUS ARABIN TOLD ME THAT SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS YOU SHOULD GO TO THEM SAID MISSUS ROBARTS AH YES BUT THAT I FEAR IS IMPOSSIBLE THE CHILDREN YOU KNOW MISSUS ROBARTS
5463-39174-0040 THAT HE WOULD BE BETTER FITTED FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS OWN DUTIES BUT HE ANSWERS ME ANGRILY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT HIS COAT IS NOT FIT FOR THE DEAN'S TABLE AND MISSUS CRAWLEY ALMOST BLUSHED AS SHE SPOKE OF SUCH A REASON WHAT WITH AN OLD FRIEND LIKE DOCTOR ARABIN
5463-39174-0041 BUT WHAT CAN I DO I FEAR THAT HE REGARDS THE RICH AS HIS ENEMIES HE IS PINING FOR THE SOLACE OF SOME FRIEND TO WHOM HE COULD TALK FOR SOME EQUAL WITH A MIND EDUCATED LIKE HIS OWN TO WHOSE THOUGHTS HE COULD LISTEN AND TO WHOM HE COULD SPEAK HIS OWN THOUGHTS
5463-39174-0043 IF I COULD ONLY DO SOMETHING FOR MY POOR GRACE IN ANSWER TO THIS MISSUS ROBARTS SAID A WORD OR TWO BUT NOT MUCH SHE RESOLVED HOWEVER THAT IF SHE COULD GET HER HUSBAND'S LEAVE SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE FOR GRACE
5463-39174-0044 AND WAS IT NOT INCUMBENT ON HER TO MAKE SOME KINDLY USE OF ALL THE GOODS WITH WHICH PROVIDENCE HAD BLESSED HERSELF AND THEN THEY WENT BACK TO THE SITTING ROOM EACH AGAIN WITH A YOUNG CHILD IN HER ARMS
5463-39174-0046 AND MOREOVER THE GINGERBREAD HAD BEEN TAKEN DOWN IN THE AUDACITY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL SPECULATIONS AND THE NUTS WERE SPREAD OUT UPON A BOARD BEHIND WHICH LUCY STOOD AS SHOP GIRL DISPOSING OF THEM FOR KISSES MAMMA MAMMA SAID BOBBY RUNNING UP TO HIS MOTHER YOU MUST BUY SOMETHING OF HER
5463-39174-0047 AND HE POINTED WITH HIS FINGERS AT THE SHOP GIRL YOU MUST GIVE HER TWO KISSES FOR THAT HEAP OF BARLEY SUGAR LOOKING AT BOBBY'S MOUTH AT THE TIME ONE WOULD HAVE SAID THAT HIS KISSES MIGHT BE DISPENSED WITH WHEN THEY WERE AGAIN IN THE PONY CARRIAGE BEHIND THE IMPATIENT PUCK AND WERE WELL AWAY FROM THE DOOR
5463-39174-0049 HOW FALSE IS HIS PRIDE AND HOW FALSE HIS SHAME BUT WE MUST REMEMBER WHAT HE HAS TO BEAR IT IS NOT EVERY ONE THAT CAN ENDURE SUCH A LIFE AS HIS WITHOUT FALSE PRIDE AND FALSE SHAME BUT SHE HAS NEITHER SAID LUCY
5463-39174-0050 BECAUSE YOU HAVE ONE HERO IN A FAMILY DOES THAT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO EXPECT ANOTHER SAID MISSUS ROBARTS OF ALL MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE MISSUS CRAWLEY I THINK COMES NEAREST TO HEROISM AND THEN THEY PASSED BY THE HOGGLESTOCK SCHOOL AND MISTER CRAWLEY WHEN HE HEARD THE NOISE OF THE WHEELS CAME OUT
5514-19192-0001 HE DID NOT ANSWER MY QUESTION HE IS A MAN WHO DOES GOOD BY GUN SHOTS SAID COMBEFERRE THOSE WHO HAVE PRESERVED SOME MEMORY OF THIS ALREADY DISTANT EPOCH KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD FROM THE SUBURBS WAS VALIANT AGAINST INSURRECTIONS
5514-19192-0002 IT WAS PARTICULARLY ZEALOUS AND INTREPID IN THE DAYS OF JUNE EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO
5514-19192-0004 IN THE PRESENCE OF IDEAS WHICH HAD THEIR KNIGHTS INTERESTS HAD THEIR PALADINS THE PROSINESS OF THE ORIGINATORS DETRACTED NOTHING FROM THE BRAVERY OF THE MOVEMENT THE DIMINUTION OF A PILE OF CROWNS MADE BANKERS SING THE MARSEILLAISE
5514-19192-0005 THEY SHED THEIR BLOOD LYRICALLY FOR THE COUNTING HOUSE AND THEY DEFENDED THE SHOP THAT IMMENSE DIMINUTIVE OF THE FATHERLAND WITH LACEDAEMONIAN ENTHUSIASM AT BOTTOM WE WILL OBSERVE THERE WAS NOTHING IN ALL THIS THAT WAS NOT EXTREMELY SERIOUS
5514-19192-0007 THE DRUM SUDDENLY BEAT CAPRICIOUS CALLS AT THE COMMAND OF SUCH OR SUCH A COLONEL OF THE NATIONAL GUARD
5514-19192-0008 SUCH AND SUCH NATIONAL GUARDSMEN FOUGHT FOR AN IDEA AND ON THEIR OWN ACCOUNT AT CRITICAL MOMENTS ON DAYS THEY TOOK COUNSEL LESS OF THEIR LEADERS THAN OF THEIR INSTINCTS
5514-19192-0010 IT SET UP THE CRY OF ALARM EACH CONSTITUTING HIMSELF A CENTRE DEFENDED IT SUCCORED IT AND PROTECTED IT WITH HIS OWN HEAD AND THE FIRST COMER TOOK IT UPON HIMSELF TO SAVE SOCIETY ZEAL SOMETIMES PROCEEDED TO EXTERMINATION
5514-19192-0011 A PLATOON OF THE NATIONAL GUARD WOULD CONSTITUTE ITSELF ON ITS OWN AUTHORITY A PRIVATE COUNCIL OF WAR AND JUDGE AND EXECUTE A CAPTURED INSURGENT IN FIVE MINUTES IT WAS AN IMPROVISATION OF THIS SORT THAT HAD SLAIN JEAN PROUVAIRE FIERCE LYNCH LAW
5514-19192-0013 WAS PURSUED IN THE PLACE ROYALE WITH A BAYONET AT HIS LOINS
5514-19192-0014 THEY SHOUTED THERE'S ANOTHER OF THOSE SAINT SIMONIANS AND THEY WANTED TO KILL HIM NOW HE HAD UNDER HIS ARM A VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE DUC DE SAINT SIMON
5514-19192-0016 OUT OF CAPRICE AND ITS OWN GOOD PLEASURE THIS FACT SINGULAR THOUGH IT MAY SEEM WAS PROVED AT THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION OPENED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INSURRECTION OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO CAPTAIN FANNICOT A BOLD AND IMPATIENT BOURGEOIS
5514-19192-0017 A SORT OF CONDOTTIERE OF THE ORDER OF THOSE WHOM WE HAVE JUST CHARACTERIZED A FANATICAL AND INTRACTABLE GOVERNMENTALIST COULD NOT RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FIRE PREMATURELY
5514-19192-0019 AND WHO WERE ALLOWING THE INSURRECTION TO FRY IN ITS OWN FAT TO USE THE CELEBRATED EXPRESSION OF ONE OF THEM FOR HIS PART HE THOUGHT THE BARRICADE RIPE AND AS THAT WHICH IS RIPE OUGHT TO FALL HE MADE THE ATTEMPT
5514-19192-0020 HE COMMANDED MEN AS RESOLUTE AS HIMSELF RAGING FELLOWS AS A WITNESS SAID HIS COMPANY THE SAME WHICH HAD SHOT JEAN PROUVAIRE THE POET WAS THE FIRST OF THE BATTALION POSTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET
5514-19192-0022 WERE MOWN DOWN POINT BLANK AT THE VERY FOOT OF THE REDOUBT AND THIS COURAGEOUS THRONG OF NATIONAL GUARDS VERY BRAVE MEN BUT LACKING IN MILITARY TENACITY WERE FORCED TO FALL BACK AFTER SOME HESITATION LEAVING FIFTEEN CORPSES ON THE PAVEMENT
5514-19192-0023 THIS MOMENTARY HESITATION GAVE THE INSURGENTS TIME TO RE LOAD THEIR WEAPONS AND A SECOND AND VERY DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE STRUCK THE COMPANY BEFORE IT COULD REGAIN THE CORNER OF THE STREET ITS SHELTER A MOMENT MORE AND IT WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO FIRES
5514-19192-0025 THIS ATTACK WHICH WAS MORE FURIOUS THAN SERIOUS
5514-19192-0026 THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN MEN KILLED AND THEY ARE USING UP OUR AMMUNITION FOR NOTHING
5514-19192-0028 AS REPRESSION HAS THE ARMY IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS MEN AND AS IT HAS VINCENNES IT DOES NOT COUNT ITS SHOTS REPRESSION HAS AS MANY REGIMENTS AS THE BARRICADE HAS MEN AND AS MANY ARSENALS AS THE BARRICADE HAS CARTRIDGE BOXES
5514-19192-0029 THUS THEY ARE STRUGGLES OF ONE AGAINST A HUNDRED WHICH ALWAYS END IN CRUSHING THE BARRICADE UNLESS THE REVOLUTION UPRISING SUDDENLY FLINGS INTO THE BALANCE ITS FLAMING ARCHANGEL'S SWORD THIS DOES HAPPEN SOMETIMES
5514-19192-0031 A WONDERFUL LIGHT APPEARS THE YAWNING MAW OF FORCE DRAWS BACK AND THE ARMY THAT LION SEES BEFORE IT ERECT AND TRANQUIL THAT PROPHET FRANCE CHAPTER THIRTEEN
5514-19192-0032 PASSING GLEAMS IN THE CHAOS OF SENTIMENTS AND PASSIONS WHICH DEFEND A BARRICADE THERE IS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS BRAVERY THERE IS YOUTH HONOR ENTHUSIASM THE IDEAL CONVICTION
5514-19192-0034 WHO WAS STILL ON THE WATCH IT SEEMS TO ME THAT PARIS IS WAKING UP IT IS CERTAIN THAT ON THE MORNING OF THE SIXTH OF JUNE THE INSURRECTION BROKE OUT AFRESH FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TO A CERTAIN EXTENT
5514-19192-0035 REANIMATED SOME FANCIES BARRICADES WERE BEGUN IN THE RUE DU POIRIER AND THE RUE DES GRAVILLIERS IN FRONT OF THE PORTE SAINT MARTIN A YOUNG MAN ARMED WITH A RIFLE ATTACKED ALONE A SQUADRON OF CAVALRY
5514-19192-0037 THE SLATS OF THE BLIND COULD BE SEEN TO TREMBLE AT EVERY SHOT A CHILD FOURTEEN YEARS OF AGE WAS ARRESTED IN THE RUE DE LA COSSONERIE WITH HIS POCKETS FULL OF CARTRIDGES MANY POSTS WERE ATTACKED AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE RUE BERTIN POIREE
5514-19192-0038 A VERY LIVELY AND UTTERLY UNEXPECTED FUSILLADE WELCOMED A REGIMENT OF CUIRRASSIERS AT WHOSE HEAD MARCHED MARSHAL GENERAL CAVAIGNAC DE BARAGUE IN THE RUE PLANCHE MIBRAY THEY THREW OLD PIECES OF POTTERY AND HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS
5514-19192-0040 AS HE RECALLED SUCHET'S SAYING AT SARAGOSSA
5514-19192-0041 THESE GENERAL SYMPTOMS WHICH PRESENTED THEMSELVES AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE UPRISING HAD BEEN RENDERED LOCAL THIS FEVER OF WRATH THESE SPARKS WHICH FLEW HITHER AND THITHER ABOVE THOSE DEEP MASSES OF
5514-19192-0043 THEY DELAYED THE ATTACK ON THE BARRICADES MAUBUEE
5514-19192-0044 IN ORDER THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE BARRICADES ONLY AND BE ABLE TO FINISH THEM AT ONE BLOW COLUMNS WERE THROWN INTO THE STREETS WHERE THERE WAS FERMENTATION SWEEPING THE LARGE SOUNDING THE SMALL RIGHT AND LEFT NOW SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY NOW AT FULL CHARGE
5514-19192-0046 THIS REPRESSION WAS NOT EFFECTED WITHOUT SOME COMMOTION AND WITHOUT THAT TUMULTUOUS UPROAR PECULIAR TO COLLISIONS BETWEEN THE ARMY AND THE PEOPLE
5514-19192-0047 MOREOVER HE HAD SEEN WOUNDED MEN PASSING THE END OF THE STREET IN LITTERS AND HE SAID TO COURFEYRAC
5514-19192-0049 WHICH THE INDIFFERENCE OF THE PEOPLE CASTS OVER OBSTINATE AND DESERTED MEN FALL OVER THEM ONCE MORE THE GENERAL MOVEMENT WHICH SEEMED TO HAVE ASSUMED A VAGUE OUTLINE HAD MISCARRIED AND THE ATTENTION OF THE MINISTER OF WAR AND THE STRATEGY OF THE GENERALS
5514-19192-0050 COULD NOW BE CONCENTRATED ON THE THREE OR FOUR BARRICADES WHICH STILL REMAINED STANDING THE SUN WAS MOUNTING ABOVE THE HORIZON
5514-19193-0001 CONTINUED TO INSULT THE CANNON AND EACH TIME THAT THAT GLOOMY CLOUD OF PROJECTILES WHICH IS CALLED GRAPE SHOT PASSED OVERHEAD WITH ITS TERRIBLE SOUND HE ASSAILED IT WITH A BURST OF IRONY YOU ARE WEARING OUT YOUR LUNGS POOR BRUTAL OLD FELLOW

5514-19193-0005 HE IS NOT IN LOVE AND YET HE MANAGES TO BE INTREPID IT IS A THING UNHEARD OF THAT A MAN SHOULD BE AS COLD AS ICE AND AS BOLD AS FIRE
5514-19193-0007 AND ASSUMING THE TONE OF AN USHER MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT HE ADDED MY NAME IS EIGHT POUNDER IN FACT A NEW PERSONAGE HAD ENTERED ON THE SCENE THIS WAS A SECOND PIECE OF ORDNANCE
5514-19193-0008 AND PLACED THIS SECOND PIECE IN LINE WITH THE FIRST THIS OUTLINED THE CATASTROPHE A FEW MINUTES LATER THE TWO PIECES RAPIDLY SERVED WERE FIRING POINT BLANK AT THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0010 THE FOUR CANNONS ECHOED EACH OTHER MOURNFULLY THE BARKING OF THESE SOMBRE DOGS OF WAR REPLIED TO EACH OTHER
5514-19193-0011 THE OTHER BALLS THE PIECE WHICH WAS FIRING BALLS WAS POINTED A LITTLE HIGH AND THE AIM WAS CALCULATED SO THAT THE BALL STRUCK THE EXTREME EDGE OF THE UPPER CREST OF THE BARRICADE AND CRUMBLED THE STONE DOWN UPON THE INSURGENTS MINGLED WITH BURSTS OF GRAPE SHOT
5514-19193-0013 FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE CABARET BY GRAPE SHOT THE ATTACKING COLUMNS COULD VENTURE INTO THE STREET WITHOUT BEING PICKED OFF PERHAPS EVEN WITHOUT BEING SEEN COULD BRISKLY AND SUDDENLY SCALE THE REDOUBT
5514-19193-0014 AND HE SHOUTED FIRE ON THE ARTILLERY MEN ALL WERE READY THE BARRICADE WHICH HAD LONG BEEN SILENT POURED FORTH A DESPERATE FIRE SEVEN OR EIGHT DISCHARGES FOLLOWED WITH A SORT OF RAGE AND JOY
5514-19193-0016 THOSE WHO WERE LEFT STANDING CONTINUED TO SERVE THE PIECES WITH SEVERE TRANQUILLITY BUT THE FIRE HAD SLACKENED THINGS ARE GOING WELL NOW SAID BOSSUET TO ENJOLRAS SUCCESS

5514-19193-0022 THE SMOKE IN THE STREET WAS LIKE A FOG WHOEVER HAS BEHELD A CLOUD WHICH HAS FALLEN INTO A MOUNTAIN GORGE BETWEEN TWO PEAKED ESCARPMENTS CAN IMAGINE THIS SMOKE RENDERED DENSER AND THICKER BY TWO GLOOMY ROWS OF LOFTY HOUSES
5514-19193-0023 IT ROSE GRADUALLY AND WAS INCESSANTLY RENEWED HENCE A TWILIGHT WHICH MADE EVEN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT TURN PALE THE COMBATANTS COULD HARDLY SEE EACH OTHER FROM ONE END OF THE STREET TO THE OTHER SHORT AS IT WAS
5514-19193-0025 HE RIFLED THE FIRST SEVEN OR EIGHT CARTRIDGE BOXES WITHOUT MUCH DANGER HE CRAWLED FLAT ON HIS BELLY GALLOPED ON ALL FOURS TOOK HIS BASKET IN HIS TEETH TWISTED GLIDED UNDULATED WOUND FROM ONE DEAD BODY TO ANOTHER
5514-19193-0026 AND EMPTIED THE CARTRIDGE BOX OR CARTOUCHE AS A MONKEY OPENS A NUT THEY DID NOT DARE TO SHOUT TO HIM TO RETURN FROM THE BARRICADE WHICH WAS QUITE NEAR FOR FEAR OF ATTRACTING ATTENTION TO HIM ON ONE BODY THAT OF A CORPORAL HE FOUND A POWDER FLASK
5514-19193-0028 AND THE SHARPSHOOTERS OF THE BANLIEUE MASSED AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET SUDDENLY POINTED OUT TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE SMOKE AT THE MOMENT WHEN GAVROCHE WAS RELIEVING A SERGEANT WHO WAS LYING NEAR A STONE DOOR POST OF HIS CARTRIDGES A BULLET STRUCK THE BODY
5514-19193-0029 FICHTRE EJACULATED GAVROCHE THEY ARE KILLING MY DEAD MEN FOR ME A SECOND BULLET STRUCK A SPARK FROM THE PAVEMENT BESIDE HIM A THIRD OVERTURNED HIS BASKET

5514-19193-0034 EVERY TIME THAT THE FLAT NOSED FACE OF THE SPECTRE APPROACHED THE URCHIN ADMINISTERED TO IT A FILLIP ONE BULLET HOWEVER BETTER AIMED OR MORE TREACHEROUS THAN THE REST FINALLY STRUCK THE WILL O' THE WISP OF A CHILD
5514-19193-0035 GAVROCHE WAS SEEN TO STAGGER THEN HE SANK TO THE EARTH THE WHOLE BARRICADE GAVE VENT TO A CRY BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF ANTAEUS IN THAT PYGMY FOR THE GAMIN TO TOUCH THE PAVEMENT IS THE SAME AS FOR THE GIANT TO TOUCH THE EARTH GAVROCHE HAD FALLEN ONLY TO RISE AGAIN
5561-39621-0001 AND LENDING AN EAR TO THE VARIOUS NOISES
5561-39621-0002 THE STRANGER DID NOT PAY THEM THE LEAST ATTENTION

5561-39621-0010 WITH CROPOLE WERE MINGLED AND JOSTLED ON THE STAIRCASE
5561-39621-0011 THE CORTEGE ADVANCED SLOWLY LIGHTED BY A THOUSAND FLAMBEAUX IN THE STREETS AND FROM THE WINDOWS
5561-39621-0013 HER GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK AT BOTH SIDES THE KING THEN APPEARED MOUNTED UPON A SPLENDID HORSE OF SAXON BREED WITH A FLOWING MANE
5561-39621-0014 THE YOUNG PRINCE EXHIBITED WHEN BOWING TO SOME WINDOWS FROM WHICH ISSUED THE MOST ANIMATED ACCLAMATIONS A NOBLE AND HANDSOME COUNTENANCE ILLUMINATED BY THE FLAMBEAUX OF HIS PAGES BY THE SIDE OF THE KING THOUGH A LITTLE IN THE REAR
5561-39621-0016 WORE TRAVELING DRESSES BUT ALL THE REST WERE CLOTHED IN WARLIKE PANOPLY
5561-39621-0017 WHEN THE KING PASSED BEFORE HIM THE UNKNOWN WHO HAD LEANT FORWARD OVER THE BALCONY TO OBTAIN A BETTER VIEW AND WHO HAD CONCEALED HIS FACE BY LEANING ON HIS ARM FELT HIS HEART SWELL AND OVERFLOW WITH A BITTER JEALOUSY THE NOISE OF THE TRUMPETS EXCITED HIM
5561-39621-0019 ALL THE NOISE ALL THE SPLENDOR HAD PASSED AWAY AT THE ANGLE OF THE STREET THERE REMAINED NOTHING BENEATH THE STRANGER BUT A FEW HOARSE DISCORDANT VOICES SHOUTING AT INTERVALS VIVE LE ROI
5561-39621-0020 HOW GOOD LOOKING THE KING IS HOW STRONGLY HE RESEMBLES HIS ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER A HANDSOME LIKENESS SAID PITTRINO

5561-39621-0034 PARRY IS THAT ALL IS THAT ALL YES MY LORD THAT IS ALL AFTER THIS BRIEF REPLY ENSUED A LONG INTERVAL OF SILENCE BROKEN ONLY BY THE CONVULSIVE BEATING OF THE HEEL OF THE YOUNG MAN ON THE FLOOR
5561-39621-0035 THE OLD MAN ENDEAVORED TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION IT WAS LEADING TO THOUGHTS MUCH TOO SINISTER
5561-39621-0037 AH PARRY REPLIED THE YOUNG MAN IRONICALLY

5561-39621-0044 AND WITH THESE WORDS WHICH HE FINISHED SHARPLY WITH A NERVOUS AND TERRIBLE LAUGH THE YOUNG MAN GIRDED ON HIS SWORD TOOK HIS HAT FROM THE TRUNK
5561-41615-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN A WOULD BE LARK
5561-41615-0001 THE MAJORITY HOWEVER APPEARED TO BE HIGHLY DELIGHTED OVER WHAT THEY HEARD ONE GROUP STANDING NEAR ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF WHICH ELEANOR WAS THE CENTER LAUGHED SO LOUDLY THAT THEY WERE SENT TO THEIR SEATS
5561-41615-0003 AT RECESS THERE WAS MORE GROUPING AND WHISPERING AND GRACE WAS PUZZLED AND NOT A LITTLE HURT OVER THE WAY IN WHICH SHE AND HER FRIENDS WERE IGNORED SUCH A THING HAD NOT HAPPENED SINCE THE BASKETBALL TROUBLE THE PREVIOUS YEAR
5561-41615-0004 ELEANOR STARTED THAT PAPER WHATEVER IT IS SAID NORA O'MALLEY TO THE PHI SIGMA TAU WHO STOOD IN A GROUP AROUND HER DESK SHE WAS HERE WHEN I CAME IN THIS MORNING AND I WAS EARLY TOO IT
5561-41615-0006 MABEL NODDED WHAT WAS WRITTEN ON IT MABEL ASKED GRACE CURIOUSLY MABEL LOOKED DISTRESSED FOR A MOMENT THEN SHE SAID
5561-41615-0007 BUT I GAVE MY WORD OF HONOR BEFORE I READ IT THAT I WOULDN'T MENTION THE CONTENTS TO ANY ONE THEN OF COURSE WE WON'T ASK YOU SAID ANNE PIERSON QUICKLY BUT TELL US THIS MUCH IS IT ABOUT ANY OF US NO REPLIED MABEL IT ISN'T IT IS SOMETHING I WAS ASKED TO SIGN
5561-41615-0009 I CAN'T BEAR TO HAVE SECRETS AND NOT TELL YOU
5561-41615-0010 WE DON'T WANT YOU TO TELL IF IT DOESN'T CONCERN US WE DON'T CARE DO WE GIRLS NO INDEED WAS THE REPLY JUST THEN THE BELL SOUNDED AND THE GIRLS RETURNED TO THEIR SEATS WITH THE RIDDLE STILL UNSOLVED
5561-41615-0012 DISMISSED THE SENIOR CLASS AND REQUESTED THE THREE LOWER CLASSES TO REMAIN IN THEIR SEATS AFTER THE SENIORS HAD QUIETLY LEFT THE STUDY HALL MISS THOMPSON STOOD GRAVELY REGARDING THE ROWS OF GIRLS BEFORE HER HER EYES WANDERED TOWARD WHERE ELEANOR SAT LOOKING BORED AND INDIFFERENT
5561-41615-0013 AND THEN SHE LOOKED TOWARD GRACE WHOSE STEADY GRAY EYES WERE FIXED ON THE PRINCIPAL'S FACE WITH RESPECTFUL ATTENTION I DON'T BELIEVE GRACE IS GUILTY AT ANY RATE THOUGHT MISS THOMPSON THEN SHE ADDRESSED THE ASSEMBLED GIRLS SOMETHING HAS COME TO MY EARS GIRLS SAID THE PRINCIPAL
5561-41615-0015 THAT IT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN FOR ANY PUPIL TO ABSENT HERSELF FROM SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTENDING A CIRCUS MATINEE OR ANY PUBLIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS NATURE I HAVE SO SEVERELY DISCIPLINED PUPILS FOR THIS OFFENCE THAT FOR A LONG TIME NO ONE HAS DISOBEYED ME
5561-41615-0016 I WAS THEREFORE ASTONISHED TO LEARN THAT A NUMBER OF GIRLS REGARDLESS OF RULES HAVE TAKEN MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND HAVE DECIDED TO ABSENT THEMSELVES FROM SCHOOL TO MORROW IN ORDER TO ATTEND THE MATINEE TO BE GIVEN IN THE THEATRE
5561-41615-0018 THE STANDARD OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE LOWERED THEREFORE I INTEND TO SIFT THIS MATTER TO THE BOTTOM AND FIND OUT WHAT MISCHIEVOUS INFLUENCE PROMPTED THIS ACT OF INSUBORDINATION REPORT SAYS THAT THIS MOVEMENT ORIGINATED IN THE JUNIOR CLASS
5561-41615-0019 AND THAT A PAPER HAS BEEN CIRCULATED AND SIGNED BY CERTAIN PUPILS WHO PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO PLAY TRUANT AND ATTEND THE MATINEE TO MORROW THE EYES OF GRACE AND HER CHUMS TURNED QUESTIONINGLY TOWARD MABEL ALLISON WHO NODDED SLIGHTLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE SO THAT WAS WHAT ALL THE WHISPERING AND MYSTERY HAD MEANT
5561-41615-0021 WHAT I INSIST UPON KNOWING NOW IS WHO ARE THE REAL CULPRITS BEGINNING WITH THE GIRL WHO ORIGINATED THE PAPER TO THE LAST ONE WHO SIGNED IT
5561-41615-0022 HER EXAMPLE WAS FOLLOWED UNTIL TWO THIRDS OF THE GIRLS PRESENT WERE STANDING THE PRINCIPAL STOOD SILENTLY REGARDING THEM WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SEVERITY THAT WAS DECIDEDLY DISCOMFITTING THAT WILL DO SHE SAID CURTLY
5561-41615-0024 I WROTE IT MISS THOMPSON SHE SAID CLEARLY I WROTE IT BECAUSE I WISHED TO
5561-41615-0025 BECAUSE IT HAS SPOILED ALL OUR FUN THERE WAS A GASP OF HORROR AT ELEANOR'S ASSERTION NO ONE HAD EVER BEFORE SPOKEN SO DISRESPECTFULLY TO THEIR REVERED PRINCIPAL MISS SAVELL SAID THE PRINCIPAL QUIETLY ALTHOUGH HER FLASHING EYES AND SET LIPS SHOWED THAT SHE WAS VERY ANGRY
5561-41615-0027 THE LATTER FLUSHED THEN TURNED PERFECTLY WHITE WITH RAGE STILL STANDING SHE REACHED DOWN
5561-41615-0028 WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS MY CONTEMPT FOR THEM AND RIGHT HERE I ACCUSE GRACE HARLOWE AND HER SORORITY OF GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM MABEL ALLISON YESTERDAY AND CARRYING IT TO YOU THEY ARE ALL TALE BEARERS AND SNEAKS
5561-41615-0030 I WILL NOT TOLERATE SUCH BEHAVIOR ELEANOR GLARED AT THE PRINCIPAL WHOSE FACE WAS RIGID IN ITS PURPOSE THEN SANK INTO THE NEAREST VACANT SEAT SAYING DEFIANTLY YOU MAY KEEP ME HERE ALL NIGHT IF YOU LIKE
5561-41615-0031 NEVERTHELESS SHE DID NOT AGAIN ATTEMPT TO LEAVE THE ROOM SHE HAD MET WITH A WILL STRONGER THAN HER OWN AND SHE REALIZED IT IGNORING ELEANOR'S FINAL REMARK MISS THOMPSON ONCE MORE TURNED HER ATTENTION TO THE MATTER IN HAND
5561-41615-0033 GRACE MOTIONED THE GIRLS TO HURRY SHE WISHED TO LEAVE THE ROOM WITH HER FRIENDS BEFORE MISS THOMPSON NOTICED THEM SHE KNEW THE PRINCIPAL WOULD INSIST ON AN APOLOGY FROM ELEANOR AND NEITHER SHE NOR HER FRIENDS WISHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ELEANOR HAD CHOSEN TO CUT THEIR ACQUAINTANCE
5561-41615-0034 GRACE WAS THOROUGHLY ANGRY WITH HER SHE COULD NOT FORGIVE ELEANOR FOR HAVING ACCUSED HER AND HER FRIENDS OF CARRYING TALES BEFORE ALMOST THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THEREFORE A FORCED APOLOGY WOULD NOT APPEASE HER WOUNDED PRIDE
5561-41615-0036 THE GIRLS SILENTLY DONNED THEIR WRAPS AND FLED FROM THE BUILDING LIKE FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE ONCE ON THE STREET A LIVELY CONFAB ENSUED ALL TALKING AT ONCE LET'S TAKE TURNS TALKING CRIED GRACE LAUGHING WE SHALL UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER A LITTLE BETTER
5561-41615-0037 SHE HAS CERTAINLY SHOWN HER TRUE COLORS THIS TIME I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING MORE UNJUST THAN THE WAY SHE ACCUSED US WHEN WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HER OLD PLAN SAID MARIAN BARBER IT WAS ABOMINABLE SAID EVA ALLEN THE OTHER GIRLS EXPRESSED THEIR DISAPPROVAL IN EQUALLY FRANK TERMS
5561-41615-0039 IT WAS PASSED TO ME BY MISTAKE VERY LIKELY AGREED GRACE I WONDER WHO DID TELL MISS THOMPSON I SAW SEVERAL GIRLS WITH THE PAPER
5561-41615-0040 THERE WILL BE WEEPING AND WAILING IN THE SKULL AND CROSSBONES CROWD EXCLAIMED NORA THEY ARE ALL IN THIS MIX UP AND IF THEY AREN'T SUSPENDED THEY'LL BE LUCKY
5561-41615-0042 IT WILL HAVE TO BE SOMETHING REMARKABLE IN THIS INSTANCE REPLIED GRACE GRIMLY AS SHE BADE THE GIRLS GOOD BYE REMEMBER GIRLS BASKETBALL PRACTICE AGAIN TO MORROW AND THE REST OF THE WEEK MISS THOMPSON HAS PROMISED ME THE GYMNASIUM PLEASE MAKE IT A POINT TO BE ON HAND
5561-41615-0043 GOOD BYE GRACE CHORUSED HER FRIENDS AND WENT ON DOWN THE STREET DISCUSSING THE PROBABLE FATE OF THE WOULD BE TRUANTS TO RETURN TO THOSE YOUTHFUL TRANSGRESSORS THEY WERE SPENDING A MOST UNCOMFORTABLE HALF HOUR WITH MISS THOMPSON SHE WAS MERCILESS IN HER DENUNCIATION OF THEIR CONDUCT
5561-41615-0045 BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FUNNY ABOUT IT NOW WHEN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR THE PRINCIPAL DISMISSED THEM THEY FILED DECOROUSLY OUT VERY UNEASY IN MIND MISS THOMPSON HAD TAKEN THEIR NAMES BUT HAD NOT STATED THEIR PUNISHMENT AND IT WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE MADE TO FEEL THE FULL WEIGHT OF HER DISPLEASURE
5561-41615-0046 WHEN THE LAST GIRL HAD DISAPPEARED THE PRINCIPAL TURNED TO ELEANOR
5561-41615-0048 YOU MAY APOLOGIZE TO ME NOW AND TO MORROW TO THE GIRLS YOU HAVE ACCUSED OF TREACHERY
5561-41616-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE JUNIORS FOREVER WHEN THE FOUR CLASSES ASSEMBLED THURSDAY MORNING EVERY GIRL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ELEANOR WAS IN HER SEAT

5561-41616-0003 THEIR PENALTY WAS FAR FROM LIGHT BUT THEY HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED AND SO THEY RESOLVED TO ENDURE IT AS BEST THEY MIGHT GRACE HARLOWE FELT A LOAD LIFTED FROM HER MIND WHEN MISS THOMPSON PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION FROM EITHER MABEL ALLISON OR THE PHI SIGMA TAU

5652-19215-0014 WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO COSETTE AT HER MAJORITY OR AT THE DATE OF HER MARRIAGE THIS TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS VERY ACCEPTABLE AS THE READER WILL PERCEIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SUM DUE WAS HALF A MILLION THERE WERE SOME PECULIARITIES HERE AND THERE IT IS TRUE
5652-19215-0015 THAT THE CLOUD DID NOT LAST LONG SHE HAD MARIUS THE YOUNG MAN ARRIVED THE OLD MAN WAS EFFACED SUCH IS LIFE AND THEN COSETTE HAD FOR LONG YEARS BEEN HABITUATED TO SEEING ENIGMAS AROUND HER
5652-19215-0017 IT IS TRUE THAT HE OVERWHELMED HER WITH GALLANT COMPLIMENTS AND PRESENTS WHILE JEAN VALJEAN WAS BUILDING UP FOR COSETTE A NORMAL SITUATION IN SOCIETY AND AN UNASSAILABLE STATUS
5652-19215-0018 NOTHING SO AMUSED HIM AS BEING MAGNIFICENT HE HAD GIVEN TO COSETTE
5652-19215-0020 PARURES IN ANTIQUE GOLDSMITH'S WORK IVORY BON BON BOXES ORNAMENTED WITH MICROSCOPIC BATTLES GEWGAWS AND RIBBONS HE LAVISHED EVERYTHING ON COSETTE COSETTE AMAZED
5652-19215-0021 HER WEDDING BASKET SEEMED TO HER TO BE UPHELD BY SERAPHIM
5652-19215-0023 EVERY MORNING A FRESH OFFERING OF BRIC A BRAC FROM THE GRANDFATHER TO COSETTE ALL POSSIBLE KNICKKNACKS GLITTERED AROUND HER ONE DAY MARIUS WHO WAS FOND OF TALKING GRAVELY IN THE MIDST OF HIS BLISS SAID
5652-19215-0024 THE MEN OF THE REVOLUTION ARE SO GREAT THAT THEY HAVE THE PRESTIGE OF THE AGES LIKE CATO
5652-19215-0026 HER HEART AND THE LOUVRE HER HEART AND THE GRAND WATERWORKS OF VERSAILLES GIVE ME MY SHEPHERDESS AND TRY TO MAKE HER A DUCHESS FETCH ME PHYLLIS CROWNED WITH CORN FLOWERS AND ADD A HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS INCOME
5652-19215-0027 I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IN THE CATHEDRAL OF STRASBURG A CLOCK
5652-19215-0029 EQUAL TO THAT FOR MY PART I AM OF THE OPINION OF THE BIG CLOCK OF STRASBURG AND I PREFER IT TO THE CUCKOO CLOCK FROM THE BLACK FOREST
5652-19215-0030 IT IGNORES THE NOBLE IN EVERYTHING IT IS CLEAN SHAVEN YOUR THIRD ESTATE IS INSIPID COLORLESS ODORLESS AND SHAPELESS THE DREAMS OF YOUR BOURGEOIS WHO SET UP AS THEY EXPRESS IT A PRETTY BOUDOIR
5652-19215-0032 I PREDICT THAT ALL WAS LOST
5652-19215-0033 I GRANT TO THIS AGE THE DEVICE DIRTY CLEANLINESS
5652-19215-0035 I BELONG TO IT HE WHO LOVES WELL LASHES WELL THEREUPON I SAY PLAINLY THAT NOW A DAYS
5652-19215-0036 AH IT IS TRUE I REGRET THE GRACE OF THE ANCIENT MANNERS I REGRET EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM THEIR ELEGANCE THEIR CHIVALRY
5652-19215-0038 THE FINE SPUN GALLANT COMPLIMENTS THE SONGS THE FIREWORKS THE FRANK LAUGHTER THE DEVIL'S OWN ROW THE HUGE KNOTS OF RIBBON I REGRET THE BRIDE'S GARTER THE BRIDE'S GARTER IS COUSIN TO THE GIRDLE OF VENUS
5652-19215-0039 ON WHAT DOES THE WAR OF TROY TURN ON HELEN'S GARTER PARBLEU WHY DID THEY FIGHT WHY DID DIOMED
5652-19215-0041 HOMER WOULD CONSTRUCT THE ILIAD HE WOULD PUT IN HIS POEM
5652-19215-0042 AND HE WOULD CALL HIM NESTOR MY FRIENDS IN BYGONE DAYS IN THOSE AMIABLE DAYS OF YORE PEOPLE MARRIED WISELY THEY HAD A GOOD CONTRACT AND THEN THEY HAD A GOOD CAROUSE
5652-19215-0044 ONLY MODERATELY CONCEALED OH THE LARGE LAUGHING MOUTHS AND HOW GAY WE WERE IN THOSE DAYS YOUTH WAS A BOUQUET
5652-19215-0045 OR A TUFT OF ROSES WHETHER HE WAS A SHEPHERD OR A WARRIOR AND IF BY CHANCE ONE WAS A CAPTAIN OF DRAGOONS
5652-19215-0047 THEY WERE SPRUCE SHINING WAVED LUSTROUS FLUTTERING DAINTY COQUETTISH WHICH DID NOT AT ALL PREVENT THEIR WEARING SWORDS BY THEIR SIDES THE HUMMING BIRD HAS BEAK AND CLAWS
5652-19215-0048 ONE OF THE SIDES OF THAT CENTURY WAS DELICATE THE OTHER WAS MAGNIFICENT AND BY THE GREEN CABBAGES PEOPLE AMUSED THEMSELVES TO DAY PEOPLE ARE SERIOUS THE BOURGEOIS IS AVARICIOUS THE BOURGEOISE IS A PRUDE
5652-19215-0050 EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BALLET DANCERS HAS HAD ITS TROUSERS A MOUNTEBANK DANCER MUST BE GRAVE YOUR RIGADOONS ARE DOCTRINARIAN
5652-19215-0051 AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT ONE ARRIVES AT WITH THAT MAJESTY AT BEING PETTY LEARN THIS JOY IS NOT ONLY JOYOUS IT IS GREAT BUT BE IN LOVE GAYLY THEN
5652-19215-0053 YOU MUST MAKE A DREAM WHIRL AROUND THE BRIDE A MARRIAGE SHOULD BE ROYAL AND CHIMERICAL IT SHOULD PROMENADE ITS CEREMONY FROM THE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS TO THE PAGODA OF CHANTELOUP
5652-19215-0054 BE ONE OF THE GODS AH PEOPLE MIGHT BE SYLPHS GAMES AND LAUGHTER ARGIRASPIDES THEY ARE STUPIDS
5652-19215-0056 DO NOT PRUNE THEM OF THEIR SPLENDORS DON'T SCRIMP ON THE DAY WHEN YOU BEAM THE WEDDING IS NOT THE HOUSEKEEPING OH IF I WERE TO CARRY OUT MY FANCY IT WOULD BE GALLANT VIOLINS WOULD BE HEARD UNDER THE TREES
5652-19215-0057 RECEIVES NO IMPRESSIONS EITHER HUMAN OR PLEASANT OR PAINFUL WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EARTHQUAKES AND CATASTROPHES THIS DEVOTION
5652-19215-0059 SOMEWHAT RESENTFUL IN HER INMOST SOUL
5652-19215-0060 SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM POOR SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR MY NEPHEW HE IS WEDDING A BEGGAR LET HIM BE A BEGGAR HIMSELF BUT COSETTE'S HALF MILLION PLEASED THE AUNT AND ALTERED HER INWARD SITUATION SO FAR
5652-19215-0062 THE FINEST IN THE HOUSE THAT WILL MAKE ME YOUNG AGAIN HE SAID IT'S AN OLD PLAN OF MINE I HAVE ALWAYS ENTERTAINED THE IDEA OF HAVING A WEDDING IN MY CHAMBER
5652-39938-0000 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WORK OF THE PHYSICIAN DOES NOT BEGIN WITH HIS CURATIVE EFFORTS THERAPY IS ALWAYS ONLY THE LAST STEP DIAGNOSIS AND OBSERVATION HAVE TO PRECEDE AND AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES OF THE DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL
5652-39938-0002 AND YET NO PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN START SUCCESSFULLY SO LONG AS THE PATIENT IS BROODING ON SECRET THOUGHTS AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS MIND THE DESIRE TO HIDE THEM MAY OFTEN BE ITSELF A PART OF THE DISEASE
5652-39938-0003 IT IS SURPRISING HOW OFTEN UNSUSPECTED VISTAS OF THOUGHTS AND IMPULSES AND EMOTIONS ARE OPENED BY AN INQUIRING ANALYSIS WHERE THE DIRECT REPORT OF THE PATIENT DOES NOT AWAKEN THE LEAST SUSPICION
5652-39938-0005 WITHHELD AND MAY FRUSTRATE EVERY PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE WHERE SUSPICION IS AWAKE AND MERE CONFIDENTIAL TALK AND PERSUASION SEEM INSUFFICIENT
5652-39938-0006 THE PHYSICIAN MAY FEEL JUSTIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF HIS PATIENT IN DRAWING THE THOUGHTS OUT OF THEIR HIDING PLACE BY ARTIFICIAL MEANS SKILL TACT AND EXPERIENCE ARE NEEDED THERE AS A MATTER OF COURSE
5652-39938-0008 WITH ALL THE MEANS NOT ONLY OF PSYCHOLOGY BUT OF NEUROLOGY AND INTERNAL MEDICINE HE HAS TO SEPARATE THE PARTICULAR CASE FROM SIMILAR ONES AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER HE DEALS WITH FOR INSTANCE A HYSTERIC OR WITH A PARANOIAC
5652-39938-0009 AND HE WILL NOT FORGET THAT THERE EXIST ALMOST NO SYMPTOMS OF SERIOUS DISEASES WHICH THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HYSTERIC MAY NOT IMITATE FOR A TIME
5652-39938-0011 IN A SIMILAR WAY THE PSYCHICAL EXAMINATION TESTS THE HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS THE VARIATIONS AND DEFECTS OF MEMORY AND ATTENTION OF JUDGMENT AND REASONING OF ORIENTATION AND SELF CONSCIOUSNESS OF EMOTIONS AND VOLITIONS
5652-39938-0012 BUT ONE RULE IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM NEVER USE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS IN A SCHEMATIC WAY LIKE A RIGID PATTERN SCHEMATIC TREATMENT IS A POOR TREATMENT IN EVERY DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE BUT IN PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICS IT IS DISASTROUS
5652-39938-0014 BUT ALL THE SUBTLE VARIATIONS OF PREJUDICES AND BELIEFS PREFERENCES AND DISLIKES FAMILY LIFE AND SOCIAL SURROUNDINGS AMBITIONS AND PROSPECTS MEMORIES AND FANCIES
5652-39938-0015 EVERY ELEMENT OF A MAN'S LIFE HISTORY IMPRESSIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD HIS LOVE AND HIS SUCCESSES HIS DISEASES AND HIS DISTRESSES HIS ACQUAINTANCES AND HIS READING HIS TALENT HIS CHARACTER HIS SINCERITY HIS ENERGY HIS INTELLIGENCE
5652-39938-0017 MOST OF THE ADJUSTMENT OF METHOD MUST BE LEFT TO THE INSTINCT OF THE PHYSICIAN IN WHICH WIDE EXPERIENCE SOLID KNOWLEDGE TACT AND SYMPATHY OUGHT TO BE BLENDED EVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THE PATIENT REACTS ON THE METHOD WILL OFTEN GUIDE THE INSTINCT OF THE WELL TRAINED PSYCHOTHERAPIST
5652-39938-0018 IT IS THEREFORE CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH THAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN SIMPLY DECIDE BEFOREHAND ON A DEFINITE COURSE OF PSYCHICAL TREATMENT AND LEAVE THE CARRYING OUT TO A WELL MEANING MINISTER OR ANY OTHER MEDICAL AMATEUR WHO SCHEMATICALLY FOLLOWS THE INDICATED PATH
5652-39938-0020 MORE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIELD OF MEDICINE THE PHYSICIAN HIMSELF HAS TO EXTEND HIS INFLUENCE FAR BEYOND THE OFFICE HOURS AND THE STRICTLY MEDICAL RELATIONS AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS NO DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN WHICH THE TREATMENT MIGHT NOT PROFIT BY THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INFLUENCE
5652-39938-0021 SUBTLE ADJUSTMENT TO THE PERSONAL NEEDS AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL CONDITIONS IS NECESSARY IN EVERY CASE WHERE THE PSYCHICAL FACTOR IS TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE
5652-39938-0023 THE FIRST METHOD TO BRING BACK THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0024 NAMELY TO REMOVE THE EXTERNAL SOURCES OF THE DISTURBANCE EXTERNAL INDICATES THERE NOT ONLY THE OUTER WORLD BUT ALSO THE OWN BODY OUTSIDE THE CONSCIOUS PARTS OF THE BRAIN
5652-39938-0026 GROWTHS IN THE NOSE MAY BE OPERATED UPON THE ASTIGMATIC OR THE SHORT SIGHTED EYE MAY BE CORRECTED BY GLASSES THE CHILD WHO IS HARD OF HEARING MAY AT LEAST BE SEATED NEAR THE TEACHER AND THE BACKWARD CHILDREN QUICKLY REACH THE AVERAGE LEVEL
5652-39938-0027 NO DOUBT IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT AS WELL OFTEN ALMOST INSIGNIFICANT AND FROM A STRICTLY PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW UNIMPORTANT ABNORMITIES IN THE BODILY SYSTEM
5652-39938-0029 TO BE SURE THE BRAIN DISTURBANCE MAY HAVE REACHED A POINT WHERE THE MERE REMOVAL OF THE ORIGINAL AFFLICTION IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO REINSTATE THE NORMAL BALANCE OF MENTAL ENERGIES BUT WHEREVER SUCH A BODILY IRRITATION GOES ON IT IS NEVER TOO LATE TO ABOLISH IT IN THE INTERESTS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY
5652-39938-0030 HOWEVER OFTEN HE MAY GET THE IMPRESSION THAT SUCH A LIBERATION WOULD STOP THE SOURCE OF THE MENTAL TROUBLE
5652-39938-0032 WE MAY BE GUIDED BY THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE INTEREST OF TESTING THE FATIGUE INDUCED BY MENTAL WORK
5652-39938-0033 IF PERHAPS FOUR HOURS OF CONCENTRATED WORK ARE DONE WITHOUT PAUSES EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT THE QUALITY OF THE WORK DETERIORATES MEASURED FOR INSTANCE BY THE NUMBER OF MISTAKES IN QUICK CALCULATION
5652-39938-0035 EVERY CAUSE OF FRICTION WHICH CAN BE PERMANENTLY ANNIHILATED FOR THE PATIENT CERTAINLY SHOULD BE REMOVED THIS NEGATIVE REMEDY DEMANDS ITS POSITIVE SUPPLEMENT
5652-39938-0036 THE PATIENT MUST BE BROUGHT UNDER CONDITIONS AND INFLUENCES WHICH GIVE FAIR CHANCES FOR THE RECUPERATION OF HIS ENERGIES TOO OFTEN FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PSYCHOLOGIST THE PRESCRIPTION IS SIMPLY REST
5652-39938-0038 AND LOSS OF SLEEP IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST PERNICIOUS CONDITIONS FOR THE BRAIN AGAIN REST IS A GREAT FACTOR IN THOSE SYSTEMATIC REST CURES WHICH FOR A LONG WHILE WERE ALMOST THE FASHION WITH THE NEUROLOGIST
5652-39938-0039 IT IS SIMPLY MEANT THAT HE GIVE UP HIS FATIGUING DAILY WORK EVEN IF THAT WORK IS MADE UP OF A ROUND OF ENTERTAINMENTS AND CALLS AND SOCIAL ENGAGEMENTS THE NEURASTHENIC AND ALL SIMILAR VARIETIES ARE SENT AWAY FROM THE NOISE OF THE CITY AWAY FROM THE RUSH OF THEIR BUSY LIFE
5652-39938-0041 THE OVER EXCITEMENT BROUGHT TO EVERYBODY BY THE SENSATIONALISM OF OUR NEWSPAPERS AND OF OUR PUBLIC LIFE ALL INJURE THE BRAIN CELLS AND DAMAGE THE EQUILIBRIUM
5652-39938-0042 THAT IS A STORY WHICH WE HEAR A THOUSAND TIMES NOWADAYS YET IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE IS REALLY MUCH TRUTH IN SUCH A CLAIM AND WHETHER MUCH WISE PSYCHOTHERAPY CAN BE DEDUCED FROM IT
5652-39938-0044 EVEN TODAY MOST PEOPLE ARE STILL WITHOUT SUSPICION THAT A NEURASTHENIC OR A PSYCHASTHENIC OR A HYSTERIC DISTURBANCE OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY BE IN ITS BEGINNING
5652-39938-0045 EARLIER TIMES SURELY MAY HAVE TREATED EVEN THE STRONGER VARIETIES OF THIS KIND AS TROUBLESOME VARIATIONS IN THE SPHERE OF THE NORMAL
5652-39938-0047 OF COURSE WE STAND TODAY BEFORE A MUCH MORE COMPLEX SURROUNDING THAN OUR ANCESTORS BUT STILL MORE QUICKLY THAN THE COMPLEXITY HAVE GROWN THE MEANS TO MASTER IT
5652-39938-0048 THERE IS NO NATION ON EARTH WHICH IS MORE PROUD OF ITS RUSH AND ITS HURRY THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND YET WHAT AN
5652-39938-0050 ABOVE ALL THE INTENSITY OF MENTAL STIMULI IS ALWAYS RELATIVE THE PSYCHOLOGIST KNOWS THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH DETERMINE THAT WE PERCEIVE THE DIFFERENCE OF IMPRESSIONS AS ALIKE WHEN THE STIMULI ARE PROPORTIONAL
5652-39938-0051 IF I HAVE A TEN POUND WEIGHT IN ONE HAND I MAY FIND THAT I MUST HAVE ONE POUND MORE IN THE OTHER HAND TO DISCRIMINATE THE DIFFERENCE
5652-39938-0053 EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE ESTIMATED WITH REFERENCE TO THE STANDARD OF THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS RELATIVITY OF THE MENTAL REACTION ON THE DEMANDS OF LIFE MUST ALWAYS BE IN THE FOREGROUND OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC REGIME
5652-39938-0054 SIMPLY TO WITHDRAW A PATIENT FROM THE ONE KIND OF LIFE
5652-39938-0056 THEY SHOULD NOT BE COMPLETE REST OR COMPLETE CHANGE OF LIFE FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT A CONTINUATION OF THE LIFE FOR WHICH ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN LEARNED WITH A REASONABLE REDUCTION OF THE DEMANDS AND STIMULATIONS
5652-39938-0057 THE INTELLECTUAL WORKER OUGHT TO DECREASE HIS WORK THE OVERBUSY SOCIETY WOMAN OUGHT TO STAY IN BED ONE DAY IN THE WEEK THE MAN IN THE MIDST OF THE RUSH OF LIFE OUGHT TO CUT DOWN HIS OBLIGATIONS
5652-39938-0059 THAT THEY ARE INTERRUPTIONS OF THAT WHICH MUST LAST AND THAT THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES TO BECOME LASTING STATES
5652-39938-0060 STRENUOSITY MUST NOT MEAN AN EXTERNAL RUSH WITH THE GESTURES OF OVERBUSY EXCITEMENT BUT CERTAINLY THE DOCTRINE OF THE LAZY LIFE IS WRETCHED PSYCHOTHERAPY AS LONG AS NO SERIOUS ILLNESS IS IN QUESTION
5652-39938-0062 THE MOST EFFECTIVE AGENCY FOR THIS TASK IS CONTACT WITH BEAUTY BEAUTY IN NATURE AND LIFE BEAUTY IN ART AND LITERATURE AND MUSIC
5652-39938-0063 TO ENJOY A LANDSCAPE OUGHT TO BE NOT MERELY A NEGATIVE REST FOR THE MAN OF THE OFFICE BUILDING AND GOOD LITERATURE OR MUSIC ABSORBS THE MENTAL ENERGIES AND HARMONIZES THEM
5652-39938-0065 WHILE THE ADVICE OF THE PHYSICIAN OUGHT THUS TO EMPHASIZE THE POSITIVE ELEMENTS WHICH WORK NOT TOWARDS REST BUT TOWARD A HARMONIOUS MENTAL ACTIVITY WE MUST NOT FORGET SOME ESSENTIAL NEGATIVE PRESCRIPTIONS
5652-39938-0066 EVERYTHING IS TO BE AVOIDED WHICH INTERFERES WITH THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
5678-43301-0001 IT WAS THROUGH THIS ALONE THAT THE FALSE UNITY OF THE CHURCH WITH ITS FANTASTIC SPIRITUAL FRATERNITY COULD BE COUNTERACTED SAINT PAUL HAD BEEN RIGHT HE DECLARED IN HIS DESIRE TO BREAK DOWN THE PARTITION WALLS BETWEEN NATIONS
5678-43301-0002 AND WRONG ONLY IN HIS EXALTATION OF JESUS CHRIST THUS HE HAD PRELUDED HIS SPEECH ON THE POOR LAW QUESTION POINTING TO THE TRUE CHARITY THAT EXISTED AMONG MASONS APART FROM RELIGIOUS MOTIVE
5678-43301-0004 AND THIS PLATFORM WAS HUNG WITH ROSES SURMOUNTED BY A SOUNDING BOARD AND SET WITH A CHAIR AND TABLE THE WHOLE SQUARE ROUND ABOUT WAS PAVED WITH HEADS AND RESONANT WITH SOUND THE MURMURS OF THOUSANDS OF VOICES
5678-43301-0005 OVERPOWERED NOW AND AGAIN BY THE CRASH OF BRASS AND THUNDER OF DRUMS AS THE BENEFIT SOCIETIES AND DEMOCRATIC GUILDS EACH HEADED BY A BANNER
5678-43301-0007 GARDEN BEDS OF COLOUR BEHIND THE MUTE WHITE STATUES THAT FACED OUTWARDS ROUND THE SQUARE FROM BRAITHWAITE IN FRONT PAST THE VICTORIANS JOHN DAVIDSON JOHN BURNS AND THE REST ROUND TO HAMPDEN AND DE MONTFORT TOWARDS THE NORTH
5678-43301-0008 THE OLD COLUMN WAS GONE WITH ITS LIONS
5678-43301-0010 NOT LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PERSONS IT WAS ESTIMATED IN THE EVENING PAPERS WERE COLLECTED WITHIN SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE PLATFORM BY NOON AS THE CLOCKS BEGAN TO TELL THE HOUR TWO FIGURES APPEARED FROM BEHIND THE STATUE AND CAME FORWARD AND IN AN INSTANT
5678-43301-0011 THE MURMURS OF TALK ROSE INTO CHEERING OLD LORD PEMBERTON CAME FIRST A GREY HAIRED UPRIGHT MAN WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN ACTIVE IN DENOUNCING THE HOUSE OF WHICH HE WAS A MEMBER ON THE OCCASION OF ITS FALL OVER SEVENTY YEARS AGO AND HIS SON HAD SUCCEEDED HIM WORTHILY
5678-43301-0013 THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT THESE LONDONERS COULD SING IT WAS AS IF A GIANT VOICE HUMMED THE SONOROUS MELODY RISING TO ENTHUSIASM TILL THE MUSIC OF MASSED BANDS FOLLOWED IT AS A FLAG FOLLOWS A FLAG STICK THE HYMN WAS ONE COMPOSED TEN YEARS BEFORE
5678-43301-0014 AND ALL ENGLAND WAS FAMILIAR WITH IT OLD MISSUS BLAND LIFTED THE PRINTED PAPER MECHANICALLY TO HER EYES AND SAW THE WORDS THAT SHE KNEW SO WELL THE LORD THAT DWELLS IN EARTH AND SEA
5678-43301-0016 THE KINGDOM OF GOD IT WAS SAID LAY WITHIN THE HUMAN HEART AND THE GREATEST OF ALL GRACES WAS CHARITY SHE GLANCED AT MABEL AND SAW THAT THE GIRL WAS SINGING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WITH HER EYES FIXED ON HER HUSBAND'S DARK FIGURE A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
5678-43301-0017 AND HIS THIN METALLIC VOICE PIPED A SENTENCE OR TWO ACROSS THE TINKLING SPLASH OF THE FOUNTAINS BEHIND HIM THEN HE STEPPED BACK AND OLIVER CAME FORWARD IT WAS TOO FAR FOR THE TWO TO HEAR WHAT WAS SAID BUT MABEL SLIPPED A PAPER SMILING TREMULOUSLY
5678-43301-0019 OF THIS GREAT ANNIVERSARY THEN THERE CAME A RETROSPECT COMPARING THE OLD STATE OF ENGLAND WITH THE PRESENT FIFTY YEARS AGO THE SPEAKER SAID POVERTY WAS STILL A DISGRACE NOW IT WAS SO NO LONGER
5678-43301-0020 IT WAS IN THE CAUSES THAT LED TO POVERTY THAT THE DISGRACE OR THE MERIT LAY WHO WOULD NOT HONOUR A MAN WORN OUT IN THE SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY OR OVERCOME AT LAST BY CIRCUMSTANCES AGAINST WHICH HIS EFFORTS COULD NOT PREVAIL
5678-43301-0022 AND ITS REWARD AND THAT HE SUPPOSED TOGETHER WITH A FEW PERIODS ON THE REFORM OF THE PRISON LAWS WOULD FORM THE FIRST HALF OF HIS SPEECH THE SECOND PART WAS TO BE A PANEGYRIC OF BRAITHWAITE TREATING HIM AS THE PRECURSOR OF A MOVEMENT THAT EVEN NOW HAD BEGUN
5678-43301-0023 OLD MISSUS BRAND LEANED BACK IN HER SEAT AND LOOKED ABOUT HER THE WINDOW WHERE THEY SAT HAD BEEN RESERVED FOR THEM TWO ARM CHAIRS FILLED THE SPACE BUT IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THERE WERE OTHERS STANDING VERY SILENT NOW CRANING FORWARD WATCHING TOO WITH PARTED LIPS
5678-43301-0025 THE TINY DARK FIGURE WAS BACK A YARD NEARER THE STATUE AND AS SHE LOOKED HIS HAND WENT UP AND HE WHEELED POINTING AS A MURMUR OF APPLAUSE DROWNED FOR AN INSTANT THE MINUTE RESONANT VOICE THEN AGAIN HE WAS FORWARD HALF CROUCHING FOR HE WAS A BORN ACTOR
5678-43301-0026 AND A STORM OF LAUGHTER RIPPLED ROUND THE THRONG OF HEADS SHE HEARD AN INDRAWN HISS BEHIND HER CHAIR AND THE NEXT INSTANT AN EXCLAMATION FROM MABEL WHAT WAS THAT THERE WAS A SHARP CRACK AND THE TINY GESTICULATING FIGURE STAGGERED BACK A STEP
5678-43302-0000 OLIVER TOLD THEM THE EXPLANATION OF THE WHOLE AFFAIR THAT EVENING AT HOME LEANING BACK IN HIS CHAIR WITH ONE ARM BANDAGED AND IN A SLING THEY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET NEAR HIM AT THE TIME THE EXCITEMENT IN THE SQUARE HAD BEEN TOO FIERCE
5678-43302-0001 BUT A MESSENGER HAD COME TO HIS WIFE WITH THE NEWS THAT HER HUSBAND WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY WOUNDED AND WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE DOCTORS HE WAS A CATHOLIC EXPLAINED THE DRAWN FACED OLIVER HE MUST HAVE COME READY FOR HIS REPEATER WAS FOUND LOADED
5678-43302-0003 BUT WELL I DARE SAY IT WAS MORE MERCIFUL BUT YOU DID WHAT YOU COULD MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY ANXIOUSLY FROM HER CORNER I CALLED OUT TO THEM MOTHER BUT THEY WOULDN'T HEAR ME
5678-43302-0004 MABEL LEANED FORWARD OLIVER I KNOW THIS SOUNDS STUPID OF ME BUT BUT I WISH THEY HAD NOT KILLED HIM OLIVER SMILED AT HER HE KNEW THIS TENDER TRAIT IN HER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE PERFECT IF THEY HAD NOT
5678-43302-0006 I SAID THAT BRAITHWAITE HAD DONE MORE FOR THE WORLD BY ONE SPEECH THAN JESUS AND ALL HIS SAINTS PUT TOGETHER HE WAS AWARE THAT THE KNITTING NEEDLES STOPPED FOR A SECOND THEN THEY WENT ON AGAIN AS BEFORE
5678-43302-0007 BUT HE MUST HAVE MEANT TO DO IT ANYHOW CONTINUED OLIVER HOW DO THEY KNOW HE WAS A CATHOLIC ASKED THE GIRL AGAIN THERE WAS A ROSARY ON HIM AND THEN HE JUST HAD TIME TO CALL ON HIS GOD AND NOTHING MORE IS KNOWN
5678-43302-0009 BUT HE WAS NOT SORRY TO BEAR PAIN IN SUCH A CAUSE AND IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE SYMPATHY OF ENGLAND WAS WITH HIM MISTER PHILLIPS EVEN NOW WAS BUSY IN THE NEXT ROOM ANSWERING THE TELEGRAMS THAT POURED IN EVERY MOMENT
5678-43302-0010 CALDECOTT THE PRIME MINISTER MAXWELL SNOWFORD AND A DOZEN OTHERS HAD WIRED INSTANTLY THEIR CONGRATULATIONS AND FROM EVERY PART OF ENGLAND STREAMED IN MESSAGE AFTER MESSAGE IT WAS AN IMMENSE STROKE FOR THE COMMUNISTS
5678-43302-0012 THE HUGE ELECTRIC PLACARDS OVER LONDON HAD WINKED OUT THE FACTS IN ESPERANTO AS OLIVER STEPPED INTO THE TRAIN AT TWILIGHT OLIVER BRAND WOUNDED CATHOLIC ASSAILANT INDIGNATION OF THE COUNTRY
5678-43302-0013 WELL DESERVED FATE OF ASSASSIN HE WAS PLEASED TOO THAT HE HONESTLY HAD DONE HIS BEST TO SAVE THE MAN EVEN IN THAT MOMENT OF SUDDEN AND ACUTE PAIN HE HAD CRIED OUT FOR A FAIR TRIAL BUT HE HAD BEEN TOO LATE
5678-43302-0015 THERE WAS SOME PASSION AND LOYALTY LEFT IN ENGLAND HIS MOTHER GOT UP PRESENTLY AND WENT OUT STILL WITHOUT A WORD AND MABEL TURNED TO HIM LAYING A HAND ON HIS KNEE ARE YOU TOO TIRED TO TALK MY DEAR HE OPENED HIS EYES
5678-43302-0016 OF COURSE NOT MY DARLING WHAT IS IT WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE EFFECT HE RAISED HIMSELF A LITTLE LOOKING OUT AS USUAL THROUGH THE DARKENING WINDOWS ON TO THAT ASTONISHING VIEW
5678-43302-0018 MY DEAR I FEEL VERY DOWNCAST SOMETIMES AS YOU KNOW WELL I DO NOT THINK I SHALL BE AGAIN I HAVE BEEN AFRAID SOMETIMES THAT WE WERE LOSING ALL OUR SPIRIT AND THAT THE OLD TORIES WERE PARTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY PROPHESIED WHAT COMMUNISM WOULD DO
5678-43302-0019 BUT AFTER THIS WELL WELL WE HAVE SHOWN THAT WE CAN SHED OUR BLOOD TOO IT IS IN THE NICK OF TIME TOO JUST AT THE CRISIS I DON'T WANT TO EXAGGERATE IT IS ONLY A SCRATCH BUT IT WAS SO DELIBERATE AND
5678-43302-0021 IF ONLY THIS INFERNAL EASTERN AFFAIR WOULD END HE KNEW HE WAS FEVERISH AND IRRITABLE AND MADE A GREAT EFFORT TO DRIVE IT DOWN OH MY DEAR HE WENT ON FLUSHED A LITTLE
5678-43302-0022 IF THEY WOULD NOT BE SUCH HEAVY FOOLS THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND YES OLIVER THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT A GLORIOUS THING IT ALL IS HUMANITY LIFE TRUTH AT LAST AND THE DEATH OF FOLLY BUT HAVEN'T I TOLD THEM A HUNDRED TIMES
5678-43302-0024 BUT SHE COULD SEE WHAT SHE LOVED TO SEE THAT RESPONSE TO HER OWN HEART AND SO THEY SAT IN SILENCE WHILE THE SKY DARKENED YET MORE AND THE CLICK OF THE WRITER IN THE NEXT ROOM TOLD THEM THAT THE WORLD WAS ALIVE AND THAT THEY HAD A SHARE IN ITS AFFAIRS
5678-43302-0025 OLIVER STIRRED PRESENTLY DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING JUST NOW SWEETHEART WHEN I SAID THAT ABOUT JESUS CHRIST SHE STOPPED KNITTING FOR A MOMENT SAID THE GIRL HE NODDED YOU SAW THAT TOO THEN
5678-43302-0027 NO MY DEAR YOU'RE EXCITED AND TIRED IT'S JUST A LITTLE SENTIMENT OLIVER I DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY THAT KIND OF THING BEFORE HER BUT SHE HEARS IT EVERYWHERE NOW NO SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER
5678-43302-0028 SHE CAN'T GET IT OUT OF HER HEAD EVEN AFTER FIFTY YEARS WELL WATCH HER WON'T YOU BY THE WAY YES THERE'S A LITTLE MORE NEWS FROM THE EAST THEY SAY FELSENBURGH'S RUNNING THE WHOLE THING NOW THE EMPIRE IS SENDING HIM EVERYWHERE
5678-43302-0030 BESIDES THE TROOPS DON'T DISPERSE AND EUROPE EUROPE IS ARMING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE I HEAR WE ARE TO MEET THE POWERS NEXT WEEK AT PARIS I MUST GO YOUR ARM MY DEAR MY ARM MUST GET WELL IT WILL HAVE TO GO WITH ME ANYHOW
5678-43302-0031 TELL ME SOME MORE THERE IS NO MORE BUT IT IS JUST AS CERTAIN AS IT CAN BE THAT THIS IS THE CRISIS IF THE EAST CAN BE PERSUADED TO HOLD ITS HAND NOW IT WILL NEVER BE LIKELY TO RAISE IT AGAIN IT WILL MEAN FREE TRADE ALL OVER THE WORLD I SUPPOSE
5678-43302-0033 THESE NEW BENNINSCHEIN EXPLOSIVES WILL MAKE CERTAIN OF THAT BUT IS IT ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT THE EAST HAS GOT THEM ABSOLUTELY BENNINSCHEIN SOLD THEM SIMULTANEOUSLY TO EAST AND WEST THEN HE DIED LUCKILY FOR HIM MABEL HAD HEARD THIS KIND OF TALK BEFORE
5678-43302-0034 BUT HER IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO GRASP IT A DUEL OF EAST AND WEST UNDER THESE NEW CONDITIONS WAS AN UNTHINKABLE THING THERE HAD BEEN NO EUROPEAN WAR WITHIN LIVING MEMORY AND THE EASTERN WARS OF THE LAST CENTURY HAD BEEN UNDER THE OLD CONDITIONS
5678-43302-0036 THE WHOLE PROCEDURE OF WAR WAS A MATTER OF THEORY THERE WERE NO PRECEDENTS WITH WHICH TO COMPARE IT IT WAS AS IF ARCHERS DISPUTED AS TO THE RESULTS OF CORDITE ONLY ONE THING WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EAST HAD EVERY MODERN ENGINE AND AS REGARDS MALE POPULATION
5678-43302-0037 HALF AS MUCH AGAIN AS THE REST OF THE WORLD PUT TOGETHER AND THE CONCLUSION TO BE DRAWN FROM THESE PREMISSES WAS NOT REASSURING TO ENGLAND BUT IMAGINATION SIMPLY REFUSED TO SPEAK THE DAILY PAPERS HAD A SHORT CAREFUL LEADING ARTICLE EVERY DAY
5678-43302-0039 EUROPEAN STOCKS WERE NOT APPRECIABLY LOWER THAN USUAL MEN STILL BUILT HOUSES MARRIED WIVES BEGAT SONS AND DAUGHTERS DID THEIR BUSINESS AND WENT TO THE THEATRE FOR THE MERE REASON THAT THERE WAS NO GOOD IN ANYTHING ELSE THEY COULD NEITHER SAVE NOR PRECIPITATE THE SITUATION
5678-43302-0040 IT WAS ON TOO LARGE A SCALE OCCASIONALLY PEOPLE WENT MAD PEOPLE WHO HAD SUCCEEDED IN GOADING THEIR IMAGINATION TO A HEIGHT WHENCE A GLIMPSE OF REALITY COULD BE OBTAINED AND THERE WAS A DIFFUSED ATMOSPHERE OF TENSENESS BUT THAT WAS ALL
5678-43303-0001 SHE PACKED HIS BAG WITH HER OWN HANDS SET OUT HIS FURS FOR THE SWIFT FLIGHT TO PARIS AND WAVED TO HIM FROM THE WINDOW AS HE WENT DOWN THE LITTLE PATH TOWARDS THE JUNCTION HE WOULD BE GONE THREE DAYS HE SAID IT WAS ON THE EVENING OF THE SECOND DAY THAT SHE FELL ILL
5678-43303-0002 AND MABEL RUNNING UPSTAIRS IN ALARM AT THE MESSAGE OF THE SERVANT FOUND HER RATHER FLUSHED AND AGITATED IN HER CHAIR IT IS NOTHING MY DEAR SAID THE OLD LADY TREMULOUSLY AND SHE ADDED THE DESCRIPTION OF A SYMPTOM OR TWO
5678-43303-0004 SO ABSORBED IN SMALL EXTERNAL MATTERS SO REMINISCENT NOW AND THEN OF THE DAYS OF HER YOUTH SO UTTERLY WITHOUT RESENTMENT OR PEEVISHNESS
5678-43303-0005 SHE FOUND LESS DIFFICULTY IN CONTEMPLATING THE END OF A VIGOROUS SOUL FOR IN THAT CASE SHE IMAGINED A KIND OF ENERGETIC RUSH OF FORCE BACK INTO THE ORIGIN OF THINGS
5678-43303-0007 THE BREAKING OF A PIECE OF CHINA MORE IRREPARABLE THAN THE RUIN OF A PALACE IT IS SYNCOPE SAID THE DOCTOR WHEN HE CAME IN SHE MAY DIE AT ANY TIME SHE MAY LIVE TEN YEARS THERE IS NO NEED TO TELEGRAPH FOR MISTER BRAND
5678-43303-0008 HE MADE A LITTLE DEPRECATING MOVEMENT WITH HIS HANDS IT IS NOT CERTAIN THAT SHE WILL DIE IT
5678-43303-0010 WELL MY DEAR SHE ASKED IT IS JUST A LITTLE WEAKNESS MOTHER YOU MUST LIE QUIET AND DO NOTHING SHALL I READ TO YOU NO MY DEAR I WILL THINK A LITTLE IT WAS NO PART OF MABEL'S IDEA TO DUTY TO TELL HER THAT SHE WAS IN DANGER
5678-43303-0011 FOR THERE WAS NO PAST TO SET STRAIGHT NO JUDGE TO BE CONFRONTED DEATH WAS AN ENDING NOT A BEGINNING IT WAS A PEACEFUL GOSPEL AT LEAST IT BECAME PEACEFUL AS SOON AS THE END HAD COME
5678-43303-0013 BACK AGAIN INTO THE STILLNESS OF THE HUGE INSTRUMENT THAT WAS ALL IN ALL TO ITSELF THOSE SAME NOTES WOULD BE STRUCK AGAIN WERE BEING STRUCK AGAIN EVEN NOW ALL OVER THE WORLD THOUGH WITH AN INFINITE DELICACY OF DIFFERENCE IN THE TOUCH
5678-43303-0014 BUT THAT PARTICULAR EMOTION WAS GONE IT WAS FOOLISH TO THINK THAT IT WAS SOUNDING ETERNALLY ELSEWHERE FOR THERE WAS NO ELSEWHERE SHE TOO HERSELF WOULD CEASE ONE DAY LET HER SEE TO IT THAT THE TONE WAS PURE AND LOVELY
5678-43303-0016 WHERE A HEAP OF LETTERS LAY TO BE ANSWERED A COUPLE OF HOURS LATER AS MABEL WENT UPSTAIRS ONCE MORE SHE MET MISTER PHILLIPS COMING DOWN HE LOOKED A LITTLE FLUSHED UNDER HIS SALLOW SKIN MISSUS BRAND SENT FOR ME HE SAID SHE WISHED TO KNOW WHETHER MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK TO NIGHT
5678-43303-0017 HE WILL WILL HE NOT YOU HAVE NOT HEARD MISTER BRAND SAID HE WOULD BE HERE FOR A LATE DINNER HE WILL REACH LONDON AT NINETEEN AND IS THERE ANY OTHER NEWS HE COMPRESSED HIS LIPS THERE ARE RUMOURS HE SAID MISTER BRAND WIRED TO ME AN HOUR AGO
5678-43303-0019 SHE WAS NOT OFFENDED FOR SHE TRUSTED HER HUSBAND TOO WELL BUT SHE WENT ON INTO THE SICK ROOM WITH HER HEART BEATING THE OLD LADY TOO SEEMED EXCITED SHE LAY IN BED WITH A CLEAR FLUSH IN HER WHITE CHEEKS AND HARDLY SMILED AT ALL TO THE GIRL'S GREETING
5678-43303-0020 SAID MABEL OLD MISSUS BRAND LOOKED AT HER SHARPLY AN INSTANT BUT SAID NOTHING DON'T EXCITE YOURSELF MOTHER OLIVER WILL BE BACK TO NIGHT THE OLD LADY DREW A LONG BREATH DON'T TROUBLE ABOUT ME MY DEAR SHE SAID I SHALL DO VERY WELL NOW
5678-43303-0022 THE SECRETARY WHO BREAKFASTED WITH HER IN THE PARLOUR LOOKING ON TO THE GARDEN HAD APPEARED STRANGELY EXCITED HE HAD TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD BE AWAY THE REST OF THE DAY MISTER OLIVER HAD GIVEN HIM HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE HAD REFRAINED FROM ALL DISCUSSION OF THE EASTERN QUESTION
5678-43303-0023 AND HE HAD GIVEN HER NO NEWS OF THE PARIS CONVENTION HE ONLY REPEATED THAT MISTER OLIVER WOULD BE BACK THAT NIGHT THEN HE HAD GONE OF IN A HURRY HALF AN HOUR LATER THE OLD LADY SEEMED ASLEEP WHEN THE GIRL WENT UP AFTERWARDS AND MABEL DID NOT LIKE TO DISTURB HER
5678-43303-0025 AS SHE CAME IN SHE TOOK UP THE EVENING PAPER BUT THERE WAS NO NEWS THERE EXCEPT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE CONVENTION WOULD CLOSE THAT AFTERNOON TWENTY O'CLOCK CAME BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF OLIVER THE PARIS VOLOR SHOULD HAVE ARRIVED AN HOUR BEFORE
5678-43303-0026 BUT MABEL STARING OUT INTO THE DARKENING HEAVENS HAD SEEN THE STARS COME OUT LIKE JEWELS ONE BY ONE
5678-43303-0028 TURNING AGAIN AND AGAIN TO THE WINDOW LISTENING TO THE SOFT RUSH OF THE TRAINS THE FAINT HOOTS FROM THE TRACK AND THE MUSICAL CHORDS FROM THE JUNCTION A MILE AWAY THE LIGHTS WERE UP BY NOW AND THE VAST SWEEP OF THE TOWNS LOOKED LIKE FAIRYLAND BETWEEN THE EARTHLY LIGHT
5678-43303-0029 AND THE HEAVENLY DARKNESS WHY DID NOT OLIVER COME OR AT LEAST LET HER KNOW WHY HE DID NOT ONCE SHE WENT UPSTAIRS MISERABLY ANXIOUS HERSELF TO REASSURE THE OLD LADY AND FOUND HER AGAIN VERY DROWSY HE IS NOT COME SHE SAID
5678-43303-0031 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN LATER THAN THIS HE MIGHT HAVE MISSED THE VOLOR HE MEANT TO CATCH THE CONVENTION MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROLONGED HE MIGHT BE EXHAUSTED AND THINK IT BETTER TO SLEEP IN PARIS AFTER ALL AND HAVE FORGOTTEN TO WIRE
5678-43303-0032 HE MIGHT EVEN HAVE WIRED TO MISTER PHILLIPS AND THE SECRETARY HAVE FORGOTTEN TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE SHE WENT AT LAST HOPELESSLY TO THE TELEPHONE AND LOOKED AT IT THERE IT WAS THAT ROUND SILENT MONTH THAT LITTLE ROW OF LABELLED BUTTONS
5678-43303-0034 OLIVER HATED INTERFERENCE AND HE WOULD SURELY SOON REMEMBER AND RELIEVE HER ANXIETY THEN EVEN AS SHE TURNED AWAY THE BELL RANG SHARPLY AND A WHITE LABEL FLASHED INTO SIGHT WHITEHALL SHE PRESSED THE CORRESPONDING BUTTON AND HER HAND SHAKING SO MUCH
5678-43303-0035 THAT SHE COULD SCARCELY HOLD THE RECEIVER TO HER EAR SHE LISTENED WHO IS THERE HER HEART LEAPED AT THE SOUND OF HER HUSBAND'S VOICE TINY AND MINUTE ACROSS THE MILES OF WIRE I MABEL SHE SAID ALONE HERE
5678-43303-0037 WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH THE PRESS COME UP HERE TO ME AT ONCE YOU MUST BE PRESENT CAN YOU HEAR OH YES COME THEN AT ONCE IT WILL BE THE GREATEST THING IN HISTORY TELL NO ONE COME BEFORE THE RUSH BEGINS IN HALF AN HOUR THE WAY WILL BE STOPPED OLIVER
5678-43303-0038 YES QUICK MOTHER IS ILL SHALL I LEAVE HER HOW ILL OH NO IMMEDIATE DANGER THE DOCTOR HAS SEEN HER THERE WAS SILENCE FOR A MOMENT YES COME THEN WE WILL GO BACK TO NIGHT ANYHOW THEN
5688-15787-0001 AFTER SUNDRY REFRESHMENTS WE WENT INTO COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHAT WAS TO BE DONE NEXT WE ALL AGREED THAT A DAY'S SPELL WOULD DO US A DEAL OF GOOD AND THAT WE SHOULD BE ALL THE BETTER PREPARED FOR GOLD DIGGING AFTERWARDS
5688-15787-0002 WE WERE THEN ONLY TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES FROM FOREST CREEK AND I PROPOSED LOOKING FOR FRESH LODGINGS AS THE HOUSE WE WERE STAYING AT WAS ANYTHING BUT RESPECTABLE THIS WAS AGREED TO AND WE SEARCHED AND WERE SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING GOOD BEDS
5688-15787-0004 I AM GOOD TO KEEP THE DOOR AND REPAIR THEIR BEER ENGINE IF THROUGH BEING OVERWORKED IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO GET OUT OF ORDER WELL I'LL SEE WHAT'S BEST TO BE DONE SAID I IN THE MEANTIME YOU HAVE A REST TILL I COME BACK

5688-15787-0007 I TOLD HER THAT AT THE FOREST INN THE LANDLORD FOUND US IN BOARD AND LODGING VERY WELL THEN SAID SHE I WILL DO THE SAME WHEN DO YOU PROPOSE TO COMMENCE TO NIGHT SAID I THEN SAID SHE I'LL TELL THE OSTLER TO LIGHT UP THE ROOM AND GET YOUR STAGE READY
5688-15787-0008 I HAD A NOBBLER AND RETURNED TO MY MATES AND FOUND THEM ASLEEP WAKE UP SAID I THERE'S BUSINESS TO BE DONE WHAT'S UP SAID FIDDLER JIM ANYTHING FRESH ASKED PLUMBER GEORGE YES SAID I TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT MY ARRANGEMENTS
5688-15787-0010 THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT GOING ABOUT INFORMING THE INHABITANTS WHAT A TREAT WAS IN STORE FOR THEM YOU MUST KNOW THAT FIDDLER JIM AND MYSELF HAD BROUGHT WITH US AN OLD DRESS COAT EACH AND BLACK TROUSERS AND WHITE WAISTCOAT ALL THE WORSE FOR WEAR
5688-15787-0011 THESE AND MY COATS AND OTHER RAGS FOR CARICATURE BUSINESS AND THE FIDDLE COMPRISED OUR PROFESSIONAL STOCK IN TRADE
5688-15787-0013 EVERYBODY WAS EAGER FOR THE DANCE OFF THEY WENT MISSUS HALLIDAY CAME IN SHE WAS A SCOTCH LASSIE AND COULDN'T KEEP HER FEET QUIET WHILE THE REEL OF TULLEGORAM WAS BEING PLAYED SHE RUSHED INTO THE ROOM AND BEGAN TO TWIST AND TWIRL ABOUT LIKE AN EEL TILL SHE NEARLY FAINTED
5688-15787-0014 WE THANKED THE COMPANY AND RETIRED TO OUR ROOM COUNTED THE CASH AND FOUND WE HAD TAKEN EIGHT POUNDS IT'S NOT BAD SAID FIDDLER JIM LET'S HAVE ANOTHER NOBBLER BEFORE WE GO TO BED SAID PLUMBER GEORGE ALL RIGHT REJOINED I
5688-15787-0016 THE PLACE WAS NOT RUSHED THE SECOND NIGHT BUT WE NEVERTHELESS ADDED FOUR POUNDS MORE TO OUR TREASURY AFTER A GOOD NIGHT'S REST WE GOT UP AND PREPARED TO START
5688-15787-0017 WE HAD ABOUT TWELVE OR FOURTEEN MILES TO WALK TO THE GREAT FOREST DIGGINGS THAT HAD GIVEN ME THE FEVER IN LONDON WE STOPPED AT SAWPIT GULLY AND HAD A REST AND BEER SIX MILES MORE AND THEN WE SAW WHAT IS NOT EASILY FORGOTTEN
5688-15787-0019 JOE JOE WHICH WAS RESPONDED TO ALL ROUND THE DIGGINGS IT WAS A SAYING OR CRY THEY HAD WHEN THE POLICE WENT ROUND TO EXAMINE THEIR LICENCES I AND MY PARTY WALKED ON TAKING OBSERVATIONS WHEN ALL AT ONCE SOME ONE CALLED OUT IS THAT YOU PLUMBER GEORGE
5688-15787-0020 YES SAID HE ALL THAT REMAINS OF ME SINCE I LEFT LONDON WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE DIGGINGS SAID MISTER POSTMAN

5688-15787-0026 THEN MISTER POSTMAN PROPOSED THAT WE SHOULD GO WITH HIM TO JOHNNY ALLSORT'S STORE AND GET SOME BEER WHILE THE DINNER WAS COOKING TO WHICH WE ALL AGREED
5688-15787-0028 AND THEN COMES MURDER CREEK WHICH TAKES YOU ON TO TARRANGOWER
5688-15787-0029 WE WERE INTRODUCED TO JOHNNY AS NEW ARRIVALS HE HAD MADE HIS FORTUNE BY SELLING TO NEW CHUMS SUCH ARTICLES AS TENTS CRADLES BUCKETS TUBS AND FRYING PANS IN FACT HE COULD SUPPLY ANYTHING EXCEPT GOLD DUST WHICH HE BOUGHT OR EXCHANGED FOR TEA SUGAR OR GROG
5688-15787-0031 SOME NEIGHBOURS CAME IN AND JIM TURNED OUT HIS FIDDLE AND PLAYED A BIT AFTER WHICH WE HAD SOME GROG FIRED OFF OUR PISTOLS RELOADED THEM MADE UP THE FIRE AND THEN TURNED INTO OUR BLANKETS WITH OUR FIREARMS UNDER OUR PILLOWS
5688-15787-0032 I SLEPT WELL TILL DAYLIGHT WHEN I GOT UP AND MADE A FIRE PUT ON THE BILLY AND HAD BREAKFAST WE THEN GAVE JOHNNY ALLSORTS ANOTHER CALL ALL OF US GOING TOGETHER MISTER POSTMAN ACCOMPANIED US TO SEE THAT WE WERE NOT IMPOSED UPON
5688-15787-0034 I CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU TO A T I HAVE ONE NOT FAR OFF THAT I BOUGHT OFF THREE DIGGERS WHO WENT TO THE NEW RUSH COME WITH ME AND YOU SHALL SEE IT AND THEN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WE ALL WENT TO LOOK AT IT AND FOUND IT TO BE A GOOD SECOND HAND TENT

5688-41232-0000 APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF MENSTRUATION ON THE POSITION OF WOMEN A QUESTION OF HISTORICAL PSYCHOLOGY
5688-41232-0001 IN REGARD TO WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SPEAK WITH CERTAINTY BUT WE HERE STRIKE ON A FACTOR OF SUCH IMPORTANCE SUCH NEGLECTED IMPORTANCE FOR THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE SEXUAL RELATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN THAT IT CANNOT BE WHOLLY IGNORED
5688-41232-0003 I AM UNCLEAN I AM UNCLEAN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WE FIND TRACES OF THE CUSTOM OF WHICH THIS IS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE BUT WE MUST NOT TOO HASTILY ASSUME THAT THIS CUSTOM IS EVIDENCE OF THE INFERIOR POSITION OCCUPIED BY SEMI CIVILIZED WOMEN
5688-41232-0004 IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A BROAD VIEW NOT ONLY OF THE BELIEFS OF SEMI CIVILIZED MAN REGARDING MENSTRUATION
5688-41232-0006 ALL THESE FIGURES ARE REPRODUCED BY PLOSS AND BARTELS EVEN IN MODERN EUROPE THE SAME IDEAS PREVAIL IN PORTUGAL ACCORDING TO REYS IT IS BELIEVED THAT DURING MENSTRUATION WOMEN ARE LIABLE TO BE BITTEN BY LIZARDS
5688-41232-0007 AND TO GUARD AGAINST THIS RISK THEY WEAR DRAWERS DURING THE PERIOD IN GERMANY AGAIN IT WAS BELIEVED UP TO THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY AT LEAST
5688-41232-0009 BY VIRTUE OF THE MENSTRUAL PROCESS WITH THE NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL POWERS OF THE WORLD EVERYWHERE MENSTRUATING WOMEN ARE SUPPOSED TO BE POSSESSED BY SPIRITS AND CHARGED WITH MYSTERIOUS FORCES IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT A SERIOUS MISCONCEPTION
5688-41232-0010 AS A MATTER OF FACT HOWEVER THE SAVAGE RARELY DISCRIMINATES BETWEEN BAD AND GOOD SPIRITS EVERY SPIRIT MAY HAVE EITHER A BENEFICIAL OR MALIGNANT INFLUENCE
5688-41232-0012 IS NOT THE ORDINARY WORD FOR THINGS PHYSICALLY FOUL IT IS A RITUAL TERM AND CORRESPONDS EXACTLY TO THE IDEA OF TABOO THE IDEAS UNCLEAN AND HOLY SEEM TO US TO STAND IN POLAR OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER
5688-41232-0013 BUT IT WAS NOT SO WITH THE SEMITES AMONG THE LATER JEWS THE HOLY BOOKS DEFILED THE HANDS OF THE READER AS CONTACT WITH AN IMPURE THING DID AMONG LUCIAN'S SYRIANS
5688-41232-0015 AT A LATER DATE FRAZER DEVELOPED THIS ASPECT OF THE CONCEPTION OF TABOO AND SHOWED HOW IT OCCURS AMONG SAVAGE RACES GENERALLY HE POINTED OUT THAT THE CONCEPTIONS OF HOLINESS AND POLLUTION NOT HAVING YET BEEN DIFFERENTIATED
5688-41232-0016 WOMEN AT CHILDBIRTH AND DURING MENSTRUATION ARE ON THE SAME LEVEL AS DIVINE KINGS CHIEFS AND PRIESTS AND MUST OBSERVE THE SAME RULES OF CEREMONIAL PURITY TO SECLUDE SUCH PERSONS FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD SO THAT THE DREADED SPIRITUAL DANGER SHALL NOT SPREAD
5688-41232-0018 AFTER DESCRIBING THE PHENOMENA ESPECIALLY THE PROHIBITION TO TOUCH THE GROUND OR SEE THE SUN FOUND AMONG VARIOUS RACES FRAZER CONCLUDES
5688-41232-0019 THE OBJECT OF SECLUDING WOMEN AT MENSTRUATION IS TO NEUTRALIZE THE DANGEROUS INFLUENCES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO EMANATE FROM THEM AT SUCH TIMES THE GENERAL EFFECT OF THESE RULES IS TO KEEP THE GIRL SUSPENDED SO TO SAY BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH
5688-41232-0021 THE PRECAUTIONS THUS TAKEN TO ISOLATE OR INSULATE THE GIRL ARE DICTATED BY REGARD FOR HER OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS FOR THE SAFETY OF OTHERS IN SHORT THE GIRL IS VIEWED AS CHARGED WITH A POWERFUL FORCE WHICH IF NOT KEPT WITHIN BOUNDS
5688-41232-0022 MAY PROVE THE DESTRUCTION BOTH OF THE GIRL HERSELF AND OF ALL WITH WHOM SHE COMES IN CONTACT TO REPRESS THIS FORCE WITHIN THE LIMITS NECESSARY FOR THE SAFETY OF ALL CONCERNED IS THE OBJECT OF THE TABOOS IN QUESTION
5688-41232-0024 AND ARGUING THAT IT PROCEEDS FROM THE CUSTOM OF EXOGAMY OR MARRIAGE OUTSIDE THE CLAN AND THAT THIS RESTS ON CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT BLOOD WHICH AGAIN ARE TRACEABLE TO TOTEMISM A THEORY WHICH WE NEED NOT HERE DISCUSS
5688-41232-0025 DURKHEIM IS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH THE GROUP OF CONCEPTIONS THAT NOW CONCERN US HE INSISTS ON THE EXTREME AMBIGUITY FOUND IN PRIMITIVE CULTURE CONCERNING THE NOTION OF THE DIVINE AND THE CLOSE CONNECTION BETWEEN AVERSION AND VENERATION
5688-41232-0027 WHICH CAN REACH SUCH A DEGREE OF INTENSITY WHICH CAN BE CALLED FORTH BY SO MANY CIRCUMSTANCES AND REAPPEARS REGULARLY EVERY MONTH TO LAST FOR A WEEK AT LEAST CANNOT FAIL TO EXTEND ITS INFLUENCE BEYOND THE PERIODS TO WHICH IT WAS ORIGINALLY CONFINED
5688-41232-0028 AND TO AFFECT THE WHOLE COURSE OF LIFE A BEING WHO MUST BE SECLUDED OR AVOIDED FOR WEEKS MONTHS OR YEARS PRESERVES SOMETHING OF THE CHARACTERISTICS TO WHICH THE ISOLATION WAS DUE EVEN OUTSIDE THOSE SPECIAL PERIODS
5688-41232-0030 DURKHEIM PROCEEDS TO ARGUE THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE OCCULT POWERS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FEMININE ORGANISM IS TO BE FOUND IN PRIMITIVE IDEAS CONCERNING BLOOD NOT ONLY MENSTRUAL BLOOD BUT ANY KIND OF BLOOD IS THE OBJECT OF SUCH FEELINGS AMONG SAVAGE AND BARBAROUS PEOPLES
5688-41232-0031 THE PROHIBITION TO DRINK WINE THE BLOOD OF THE GRAPE FOUND AMONG SOME PEOPLES IS TRACED TO ITS RESEMBLANCE TO BLOOD AND TO ITS SACRIFICIAL EMPLOYMENT AS AMONG THE ANCIENT ARABIANS AND STILL IN THE CHRISTIAN SACRAMENT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR DRINKING BLOOD
5688-41232-0033 A MORE OR LESS CONSCIOUS ANXIETY A CERTAIN RELIGIOUS FEAR CANNOT FAIL TO ENTER INTO ALL THE RELATIONS OF HER COMPANIONS WITH HER AND THAT IS WHY ALL SUCH RELATIONS ARE REDUCED TO A MINIMUM RELATIONS OF A SEXUAL CHARACTER ARE SPECIALLY EXCLUDED
5688-41232-0034 IN THE FIRST PLACE SUCH RELATIONS ARE SO INTIMATE THAT THEY ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE SORT OF REPULSION WHICH THE SEXES MUST EXPERIENCE FOR EACH OTHER THE BARRIER BETWEEN THEM DOES NOT PERMIT OF SUCH A CLOSE UNION IN THE SECOND PLACE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY HERE SPECIALLY CONCERNED
5688-41232-0036 IN ANY CASE INDEED THE SAME IDEAS BEING TRANSFERRED TO WOMEN ALSO COITUS PRODUCES WEAKNESS AND IT PREVENTS THE ACQUISITION OF SUPERNATURAL POWERS THUS AMONG THE WESTERN TRIBES OF CANADA BOAS STATES
5688-41232-0037 ONLY A YOUTH WHO HAS NEVER TOUCHED A WOMAN OR A VIRGIN
5688-41232-0039 YET THE TWOFOLD INFLUENCE OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN REMAINS CLEAR WHEN WE REVIEW THE WHOLE GROUP OF INFLUENCES WHICH IN THIS STATE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO EXERT SHE BY NO MEANS ACTS ONLY BY PARALYZING SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND DESTROYING THE POWERS OF LIFE
5688-41232-0040 OH MENSTRUATING WOMAN THOU'RT A FIEND FROM WHOM ALL NATURE SHOULD BE CLOSELY SCREENED HER POWERS ARE ALSO BENEFICIAL
5688-41232-0042 IN OUR OWN TIME THE SLOW DISINTEGRATION OF PRIMITIVE ANIMISTIC CONCEPTIONS AIDED CERTAINLY BY THE DEGRADED CONCEPTION OF SEXUAL PHENOMENA TAUGHT BY MEDIAEVAL MONKS FOR WHOM WOMAN WAS TEMPLUM AEDIFICATUM SUPER CLOACAM
5688-41232-0043 HAS LED TO A DISBELIEF IN THE MORE SALUTARY INFLUENCES OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD FAITH IN HER PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE ALONE SURVIVES IT MAY BE TRACED EVEN IN PRACTICAL AND COMMERCIAL ONE MIGHT ADD MEDICAL QUARTERS
5688-41232-0045 FOR THE SAME REASON TO TURN TO THE EAST NO WOMAN IS EMPLOYED IN THE OPIUM MANUFACTORY AT SAIGON IT BEING SAID THAT THE OPIUM WOULD TURN AND BECOME BITTER
5688-41232-0046 DECLARED THAT ONE OF THE WOMEN WORKERS MUST BE MENSTRUATING ALL THE WOMEN HINDUS MAHOMETANS ABORIGINAL GONDS ET CETERA SHOWED BY THEIR ENERGETIC DENIALS THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THIS SUPERSTITION
5688-41232-0048 A THIRD WROTE IN THE JOURNAL FOR APRIL TWENTY SEVENTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I THOUGHT THE FACT WAS SO GENERALLY KNOWN TO EVERY HOUSEWIFE AND COOK THAT MEAT WOULD SPOIL IF SALTED AT THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD THAT I AM SURPRISED TO SEE SO MANY LETTERS ON THE SUBJECT IN THE JOURNAL
5688-41232-0049 IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FACT THAT MEAT WILL BE TAINTED IF CURED BY WOMEN AT THE CATAMENIAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0051 BUT WHY THIS DELAY IF TIME IS PRECIOUS AND IT ENTERS AS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CASE
5688-41232-0052 FOR BEING SWOLLEN THEN BY THE AFFLUX OF BLOOD
5688-41232-0054 YET I HAVE NOT HESITATED TO PERFORM THESE OPERATIONS AT SUCH A TIME AND HAVE NEVER HAD REASON TO REGRET THE COURSE THE ONLY OPERATIONS THAT I SHOULD DISLIKE TO PERFORM DURING MENSTRUATION WOULD BE THOSE INVOLVING THE WOMB ITSELF
5688-41232-0055 IT MUST BE ADDED TO THIS THAT WE STILL HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT MERELY THE SURVIVING INFLUENCE OF ANCIENT PRIMITIVE BELIEFS BUT THE POSSIBLE EXISTENCE OF ACTUAL NERVOUS CONDITIONS DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD
5688-41232-0057 THUS HE SPEAKS OF TWO YOUNG GIRLS OF ABOUT SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN SLIGHTLY NEUROPATHIC BUT WITHOUT DEFINITE HYSTERICAL SYMPTOMS WHO DURING THE MENSTRUAL PERIOD FEEL THEMSELVES IN A SORT OF ELECTRICAL STATE
5688-41232-0058 WITH TINGLING AND PRICKLING SENSATIONS AND FEELINGS OF ATTRACTION OR REPULSION AT THE CONTACT OF VARIOUS OBJECTS THESE GIRLS BELIEVE THEIR GARMENTS STICK TO THEIR SKIN DURING THE PERIODS IT WAS ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY THAT THEY COULD REMOVE THEIR SLIPPERS THOUGH FITTING EASILY
5688-41232-0060 AN ORCHESTRAL PERFORMER ON THE DOUBLE BASS INFORMED LAURENT THAT WHENEVER HE LEFT A TUNED DOUBLE BASS IN HIS LODGINGS DURING HIS WIFE'S PERIOD A STRING SNAPPED CONSEQUENTLY HE ALWAYS REMOVED HIS INSTRUMENT AT THIS TIME TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
5688-41232-0061 HE ADDED THAT THE SAME THING HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER WITH A MISTRESS A CAFE CONCERT SINGER WHO HAD INDEED WARNED HIM BEFOREHAND A HARPIST ALSO INFORMED LAURENT THAT SHE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO GIVE UP HER PROFESSION
5688-41232-0063 AND ARE CAREFUL NOT TO PLAY ON THEIR INSTRUMENTS AT THIS TIME TWO YOUNG LADIES BOTH GOOD VIOLINISTS ALSO AFFIRMED THAT EVER SINCE THEIR FIRST MENSTRUATION THEY HAD NOTED A TENDENCY FOR THE STRINGS TO SNAP AT THIS PERIOD
5688-41232-0064 ONE A GENUINE ARTIST WHO OFTEN PERFORMED AT CHARITY CONCERTS SYSTEMATICALLY REFUSED TO PLAY AT THESE TIMES AND WAS OFTEN EMBARRASSED TO FIND A PRETEXT THE OTHER WHO ADMITTED THAT SHE WAS NERVOUS AND IRRITABLE AT SUCH TIMES
5688-41232-0066 BUT THAT THERE IS SPONTANEOUS BREAKAGE MOST USUALLY IT HAPPENS THAT A GLASS BREAKS WHEN IT IS BEING DRIED WITH A CLOTH NEEDLES ALSO BREAK WITH UNUSUAL FACILITY AT THIS TIME CLOCKS ARE STOPPED BY MERELY PLACING THE HAND UPON THEM
5688-41232-0067 I DO NOT HERE ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE CRITICALLY THE VALIDITY OF THESE ALLEGED MANIFESTATIONS SOME OF WHICH MAY CERTAINLY BE EXPLAINED BY THE UNCONSCIOUS MUSCULAR ACTION WHICH FORMS THE BASIS OF THE PHENOMENA OF TABLE TURNING AND THOUGHT READING
5688-41232-0069 IN AFFECTING THE SOCIAL POSITION OF WOMEN WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE ANALYSIS OF THE ELEMENTS THAT GO TO MAKE UP THAT INFLUENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE FURTHER POINT TO WHICH ATTENTION MAY BE CALLED
5688-41232-0070 I ALLUDE TO THE WAY IN WHICH THE MORE FAVORABLE SIDE OF THE PRIMITIVE CONCEPTION OF THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AS PRIESTESS SIBYL PROPHETESS AN ALMOST MIRACULOUS AGENT FOR GOOD AN ANGEL THE PECULIAR HOME OF THE DIVINE ELEMENT
5688-41232-0072 THE MORE FAVORABLE ASPECT OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW OF WOMEN'S MAGIC FUNCTION HAS NEVER QUITE DIED OUT THE GRADUAL DECAY AND DEGRADATION OF THE PRIMITIVE VIEW HAS ON THE WHOLE INVOLVED A LOWER ESTIMATE OF WOMEN'S NATURE AND POSITION
5688-41232-0073 WOMAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE WITCH SHE WAS SO EVEN IN ANCIENT BABYLONIA BUT SHE HAS CEASED TO BE THE PRIESTESS THE EARLY TEUTONS SAW SANCTUM ALIQUID ET PROVIDUM IN WOMEN WHO FOR THE MEDIAEVAL GERMAN PREACHER
5688-41232-0075 AND THE GRADUAL EVOLUTION FROM ONE EXTREME OF THE MAGICAL DOCTRINE TO THE OTHER WAS INEVITABLE IN AN ADVANCED CIVILIZATION AS WE SEE THESE IDEAS HAVING THEIR ULTIMATE BASIS ON THE OLD STORY OF THE SERPENT
5688-41232-0076 AND ON A SPECIAL AND MYSTERIOUS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MENSTRUATING WOMAN AND THE OCCULT FORCES OF MAGIC TEND TO DIE OUT THE SEPARATION OF THE SEXES THEY INVOLVE BECOMES UNNECESSARY LIVING IN GREATER COMMUNITY WITH MEN
5703-47198-0001 WHO WAS AWAITING HER APPROACH IN A HIGH STATE OF EXCITEMENT HURRY UP JULIET SHE CRIED AS SOON AS SHE COULD MAKE HERSELF HEARD YOU'LL NEVER GUESS WHAT THERE IS FOR YOU SOMETHING YOU DON'T OFTEN GET WHAT IS IT SAID JULIET COMING UP THE STEPS

5703-47198-0007 THAT IT MUST BE AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM SOME SHOP DEAR MADAM WE SHALL ESTEEM IT A FAVOUR IF YOU CAN MAKE IT CONVENIENT TO CALL UPON US ONE DAY NEXT WEEK UPON A MATTER OF BUSINESS CONNECTED WITH A MEMBER OF YOUR FAMILY
5703-47198-0008 IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE YOU FURTHER DETAILS IN A LETTER BUT IF YOU WILL GRANT US THE INTERVIEW WE VENTURE TO ASK
5703-47198-0010 SOLICITORS THE ADDRESS WAS A STREET IN HOLBORN JULIET READ THE LETTER THROUGH AND STRAIGHTWAY READ IT THROUGH AGAIN WITH A BEATING HEART WHAT DID IT MEAN WAS IT POSSIBLE SHE WAS GOING TO FIND HER OWN FAMILY AT LAST
5703-47198-0011 SHE WAS RECALLED TO THE PRESENT BY THE VOICE OF DORA WHOM SHE NOW PERCEIVED TO BE READING THE LETTER OVER HER SHOULDER WITH UNBLUSHING INTEREST SAY SAID DORA ISN'T IT EXCITING SOMETHING TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
5703-47198-0013 I DO WISH THE OTHERS WOULD COME IN THERE'S NO ONE IN THE HOUSE EXCEPT SIR ARTHUR WHERE IS HE SAID JULIET PUTTING THE SHEET OF PAPER BACK INTO THE ENVELOPE AND SLIPPING IT UNDER HER WAISTBAND YOU KNOW DORA
5703-47198-0014 I WONDER YOU AREN'T ASHAMED OF YOURSELF I'M SURPRISED AT YOU I SHOULDN'T HAVE READ IT IF YOU'D BEEN QUICKER ABOUT TELLING ME WHAT WAS IN IT RETORTED DORA IT'S NOT AT ALL A NICE THING TO PUT TEMPTATION IN THE WAY OF A LITTLE GIRL LIKE ME
5703-47198-0016 HULLO WHAT'S THIS HE READ IT THROUGH CAREFULLY WHY JULIET HE SAID WHEN HE HAD FINISHED THIS IS VERY INTERESTING ISN'T IT IT LOOKS AS IF YOU WERE GOING TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT YOURSELF DOESN'T IT
5703-47198-0017 AFTER ALL THESE YEARS WELL WELL YOU THINK I MUST GO THEN SHE SAID A LITTLE DOUBTFULLY GO OF COURSE I SHOULD GO IF I WERE YOU WHY NOT
5703-47198-0019 NO MY DEAR YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BESIDES I PROMISED LENA I WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ARE THE CHILD OF A FRIEND OF HERS THAT IS ALL I KNOW I THINK SHE SCARCELY REALIZED HOW HARD IT WOULD BE FOR YOU NOT TO KNOW MORE WHEN YOU GREW UP
5703-47198-0020 I OFTEN THINK THAT IF SHE HAD LIVED SHE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE NOW IF YOU PROMISED HER NOT TO ASK I WON'T ASK EITHER SAID JULIET LOYALLY BUT I HOPE THEY'LL TELL ME IT WILL BE DIFFERENT WON'T IT IF THEY TELL ME WITHOUT MY ASKING
5703-47198-0022 IF THEY MEAN TO TELL YOU THEY WILL AND IF THEY DON'T YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO GET IT OUT OF THEM AND WHEN SHALL I GO CRIED JULIET THEY SAY THEY WANT ME TO ANSWER IMMEDIATELY YOU KNOW OH WELL I DON'T KNOW
5703-47198-0023 IN A FEW DAYS YOU WILL HARDLY BE READY TO START TO MORROW WILL YOU I COULD BE READY EASILY SAID JULIET YOU'RE IN A GREAT HURRY TO GET AWAY FROM US SAID SIR ARTHUR WITH A RATHER UNEASY LAUGH NOT FROM YOU
5703-47198-0025 YOU OUGHT TO SET UP A SCHOOL FOR YOUNG LADIES I DON'T BELIEVE I SHALL BE ABLE TO GET ON WITHOUT MY ELDEST DAUGHTER HE REPLIED HALF SERIOUS STILL I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR YOU IF YOUR REAL PARENTS HAVE DECIDED TO OWN UP TO YOU
5703-47198-0026 AT ALL EVENTS IF THEY DO NOT TURN OUT DESIRABLE I SHALL STILL BE HERE I HOPE SO I DON'T SEE HOW YOU CAN LOSE ANYTHING BY TAKING THIS CHANCE OF FINDING OUT WHAT YOU CAN ABOUT THEM AT THIS POINT LADY BYRNE CAME INTO THE ROOM
5703-47198-0028 ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HER ARTHUR SHE ADDED TURNING TO HER HUSBAND I WOULD LIKE A SHOT HE REPLIED BUT I CAN'T POSSIBLY GET AWAY NEXT WEEK I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK ON HAND JUST NOW I SUPPOSE MY DEAR HE SUGGESTED DOUBTFULLY
5703-47198-0029 THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RUN OVER WITH HER LADY BYRNE DECLARED THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HER TO DO SO SHE HAD ENGAGEMENTS SHE SAID FOR EVERY DAY OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK WHICH IT WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION TO BREAK
5703-47198-0031 BUT AT LEAST IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT SOME ONE MUST BE THERE TO RECEIVE HIS GUESTS NO JULIET WOULD HAVE TO GO ALONE SHE WAS REALLY OLD ENOUGH TO BE TRUSTED BY HERSELF FOR THREE DAYS AND THERE WAS NO NEED THAT SHE COULD SEE
5703-47198-0032 SHE CAN GO ON MONDAY SEE THE LAWYERS ON TUESDAY AND COME BACK ON WEDNESDAY SAID LADY BYRNE THE HELPLESSNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS IS THE ONE THING I DISAPPROVE OF IN YOUR EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF EDUCATION
5703-47198-0034 SHE CAN WRITE OR CABLE TO US WHEN SHE HAS SEEN THE SOLICITORS AND IT IS NO USE PROVIDING FOR CONTINGENCIES THAT WILL PROBABLY NEVER ARISE
5703-47198-0035 A LETTER WAS WRITTEN AND DISPATCHED TO MESSRS FINDLAY AND INCE SAYING THAT MISS BYRNE WOULD HAVE PLEASURE IN CALLING UPON THEM AT TWELVE O'CLOCK ON THE FOLLOWING TUESDAY AND JULIET BUSIED HERSELF IN PREPARATIONS FOR HER JOURNEY
5703-47198-0037 AND TO BREATHE THE GENTLE AIR FROM THE SEA THAT MET THEM AS THEY CROSSED THE GANGWAY ON TO THE STEAMER JULIET ENJOYED EVERY MOMENT OF THE JOURNEY AND WOULD HAVE BEEN SORRY WHEN THE CROSSING WAS OVER IF SHE HAD NOT BEEN SO EAGER TO SET FOOT UPON HER NATIVE SOIL
5703-47198-0038 SHE LEANT UPON THE RAIL IN THE BOWS OF THE SHIP WATCHING THE WHITE CLIFFS GROW TALLER AND MORE DISTINCT AND FELT THAT NOW INDEED SHE UNDERSTOOD THE EMOTIONS
5703-47198-0040 HAVE YOU BEEN AWAY FROM ENGLAND A LONG TIME SHE ASKED HER I HAVE BEEN ABROAD DURING A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REPLIED THE PERSON SHE ADDRESSED A STERN LOOKING SCOTCHWOMAN WHO DID NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION
5703-47198-0041 FROM HER SEVERE DEMEANOUR JULIET IMAGINED SHE MIGHT BE A GOVERNESS GOING FOR A HOLIDAY YOU MUST BE GLAD TO BE GOING HOME SHE VENTURED IT'S A FAR CRY NORTH TO MY HOME SAID THE SCOTCHWOMAN THAWING SLIGHTLY
5703-47198-0043 WHICH IS ONE OF THE BONNIEST THINGS YOU SEE ON THE CONTINENT TO MY WAY OF THINKING JULIET COULD GET NO ENTHUSIASM OUT OF HER AND LOOK WHICH WAY SHE MIGHT SHE COULD NOT SEE ANY REFLECTION ON THE FACES OF THOSE AROUND HER OF THE EMOTIONS WHICH STIRRED IN HER OWN BREAST
5703-47198-0044 IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH CROSSING IN SPITE OF THE CLOUDLESS SKY AND BROILING SUNSHINE AND MOST OF THE PASSENGERS HAD BEEN LAID LOW BY THE ROLLING OF THE VESSEL THEY DISPLAYED ANXIETY ENOUGH TO REACH LAND
5703-47198-0046 PUT HER INTO A CARRIAGE AND MINISTERED TO HER WANTS WITH THE HELP OF A TEA BASKET CONTAINING THE DELICIOUS NOVELTY OF ENGLISH BREAD AND BUTTER IN HALF AN HOUR'S TIME THEY WERE STEAMING HURRIEDLY TOWARDS LONDON SHE WAS TO LODGE AT A SMALL HOTEL IN JERMYN STREET
5703-47198-0047 SHE WAS YOUNG STRONG AND HEALTHY AND THERE WAS NO REASON THAT TRIFLING DISCOMFORTS OF THIS KIND SHOULD AFFECT HER ENJOYMENT TO THE SHORTCOMINGS OF THE BED INDEED SHE SHUT HER EYES IN MORE SENSES THAN ONE
5703-47198-0049 OVER THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES OPPOSITE SHE COULD SEE A BLUE STREAK OF SKY ALREADY THE AIR HAD LOST THE TOUCH OF FRESHNESS WHICH COMES EVEN TO LONDON IN AUGUST DURING THE FIRST HOURS OF THE MORNING
5703-47198-0050 AND THE HEAT IN THE LOW CEILINGED ROOM ON THE THIRD FLOOR WHICH JULIET OCCUPIED FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY WAS OPPRESSIVE IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SASH WINDOWS BEING OPENED TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY
5703-47198-0052 SHE WAS GOING TO HEAR TREMENDOUS NEWS THAT DAY MAKE WONDERFUL DISCOVERIES ABOUT HER BIRTH HEAR UNDREAMT OF THINGS
5703-47198-0053 AND IT WOULD NOT HAVE ASTONISHED HER TO FIND HERSELF CLAIMED AS DAUGHTER BY ANY OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING OR SO SHE SAID TO HERSELF HOWEVER ASTOUNDING AND THAT BEING SO SHE WAS EXCITED IN PROPORTION
5703-47198-0055 AND SHE FILLED THE AIR WITH CASTLES OF EVERY STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE THAT HER FANCY SUGGESTED WITHOUT ANY HINDRANCE FROM DOUBT OR MISGIVING SHE DRESSED QUICKLY IN THE GAYEST HUMOUR BUT WITH EVEN MORE CARE THAN SHE USUALLY BESTOWED UPON HER APPEARANCE
5703-47198-0056 SCANDALIZED AT THE IDEA OF SUCH A PRECIOUS GARMENT BEING PUT ON BEFORE BREAKFAST THAT VERY ONE JULIET ASSURED HER UNDAUNTED AND WAS ARRAYED IN IT IN SPITE OF OBVIOUS DISAPPROVAL AFTER BREAKFAST THEY WENT OUT
5703-47198-0058 BUT MORE THAN ONE HEAD WAS TURNED TO GAZE AT THE PRETTY GIRL IN THE GARDEN PARTY DRESS WHO STOOD TRANSFIXED BEFORE SHOP AFTER SHOP THIS AMUSEMENT LASTED TILL HALF PAST ELEVEN WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL FOR JULIET TO GIVE THE FINAL PATS TO HER HAIR
5703-47198-0059 BEFORE SHE STARTED TO KEEP HER APPOINTMENT WITH THE SOLICITORS
5703-47212-0001 WAS A PICTURESQUE ADDITION TO THE LANDSCAPE AS SHE APPROACHED THE WOODEN LANDING STAGE THAT STOOD HALF A MILE BELOW THE PROMONTORY ON WHICH THE CASTLE WAS BUILT IT WAS THE MORNING OF FRIDAY THE DAY FOLLOWING THE FUNERAL
5703-47212-0002 IN SPITE OF THE BRILLIANT SUNSET OF THE PREVIOUS EVENING THE LOCH LAY DARK AND STILL ITS SURFACE WORE AN OILY TREACHEROUS LOOK EVERY DETAIL OF THE INVERASHIEL'S TUB LIKE SHAPE WAS REFLECTED AND BEAUTIFULLY DISTORTED IN THE WATER
5703-47212-0004 ONE OF THESE WAS IN THE ACT OF SLACKENING THE ROPE BY WHICH THE BOAT HAD BEEN WARPED ALONGSIDE WHEN A RUNNING GESTICULATING FIGURE APPEARED IN THE DISTANCE SHOUTING TO THEM TO WAIT FOR HIM WAITED FOR ACCORDINGLY HE WAS AND IN A FEW MINUTES GIMBLET
5703-47212-0005 RATHER OUT OF BREATH AFTER HIS RUN HURRIED ON BOARD AND WITH A WORD OF APOLOGY AND THANKS TO THE OBLIGING SKIPPER TURNED LIKE THE OTHER PASSENGERS TOWARDS THE SHELTER OF THE CABIN WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR HE HESITATED
5703-47212-0007 SEARCHING AMONG LORD ASHIEL'S PAPERS IN THE LIBRARY AT THE CASTLE IT WAS JULIA ROMANINOV BEYOND A DOUBT AND GIMBLET DREW BACK QUICKLY AND TOOK UP HIS POSITION BEHIND THE FUNNELS ON THE AFTER DECK
5703-47212-0008 IN SPITE OF THE RAIN HE REMAINED THERE UNTIL THE BOAT REACHED CRIANAN LEANING AGAINST THE RAIL WITH HIS COLLAR TURNED UP AND HIS SOFT FELT HAT PULLED DOWN OVER HIS EARS SO THAT LITTLE OF HIM WAS VISIBLE EXCEPT THE TIP OF HIS NOSE
5703-47212-0010 OR FOLLOWED THE SMOOTH SOARING MOVEMENTS OF THE GULLS THAT SWOOPED AND CIRCLED AROUND HER
5703-47212-0011 AS THEY DREW NEAR TO CRIANAN HE CONCEALED HIMSELF STILL MORE CAREFULLY BEHIND A PILE OF CRATES AND NOT TILL MISS ROMANINOV HAD LEFT THE STEAMER DID HE EMERGE FROM HIS HIDING PLACE AND STEP WARILY OFF THE BOAT
5703-47212-0013 OR SAMPLES OF ROYAL STEWART TARTAN AND TAKING AN EXTRAORDINARY INTEREST IN FISHING TACKLE AND TROUT FLIES BUT THOUGH THE GIRL LOOKED BACK MORE THAN ONCE THE LITTLE MAN IN THE ULSTER WHO WAS SO INTENT ON PICKING HIS WAY BETWEEN THE PUDDLES
5703-47212-0014 DID NOT APPARENTLY PROVIDE HER WITH ANY FOOD FOR SUSPICION AND SHE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHO WAS SO CAREFULLY SHELTERED BENEATH THE UMBRELLA HE CARRIED AT LAST THEY LEFT THE COBBLE STONES OF THE LITTLE TOWN AND EMERGED UPON THE HIGH ROAD
5703-47212-0016 WHICH WAS MASQUERADING AS AN ARTICLE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT IN THE WINDOW OF THE LAST OUTLYING SHOP FROM THIS POSITION NOT WITHOUT ITS EMBARRASSMENTS SINCE A COUPLE OF BAREFOOTED CHILDREN CAME INSTANTLY TO THE DOOR WHERE THEY STOOD AND STARED AT HIM UNBLINKINGLY
5703-47212-0017 HE SAW THE RUSSIAN ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE MOOR AND LOOK WHERE HE WOULD COULD PERCEIVE NO MEANS OF KEEPING UP WITH HER UNOBSERVED UPON THE BARE SIDE OF THE HILL JUST AS HE DECIDED THAT THE DISTANCE SEPARATING THEM HAD INCREASED TO AN EXTENT
5703-47212-0019 FOR TEN LONG MINUTES THEY STOOD TALKING DRIVING POOR GIMBLET TO THE DESPERATE EXPEDIENT OF ENTERING THE SHOP AND DEMANDING A CLOSER ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE CAIRNGORM IT IS HUMILIATING TO RELATE THAT HE RECOILED BEFORE IT WHEN IT WAS PLACED IN HIS HAND
5703-47212-0020 AND NEARLY FLED AGAIN INTO THE ROAD HOWEVER HE PULLED HIMSELF TOGETHER AND HELD THE PROUD PROPRIETRESS A GAUNT GREY HAIRED WOMAN WITH KNITTING NEEDLES EVER CLICKING IN HER DEXTEROUS HANDS
5703-47212-0022 AND THOUGH THE SHOPWOMAN PLAINLY DOUBTED HIS VERACITY AND KEPT A SHARP EYE THAT HE DID NOT TAKE TO HIS HEELS WITH THE CAIRNGORM SHE DID NOT GO SO FAR AS TO SUGGEST HIS REMOVING HIMSELF FROM THE ZONE OF TEMPTATION
5703-47212-0023 AT LAST WHEN FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME HE PUT HIS NOSE ROUND THE DOORPOST HE SAW THAT THE PAIR HAD SEPARATED AND WERE WALKING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE GIRL CONTINUING ON HER WAY WHILE THE MAN RETURNED TO THE TOWN
5703-47212-0025 WHICH SHE PRESSED UPON HIM AS PARTICULARLY SUITED TO HIS NEEDS AND CHARGED HIM FOURPENCE FOR BY THE TIME HE ISSUED FORTH INTO THE OPEN AIR HIS POCKETS FULL OF PACKAGES THE STRANGER HAD PASSED THE SHOP AND WAS TURNING THE CORNER OF THE NEXT HOUSE
5703-47212-0026 TO HIM NOW GIMBLET DEVOTED HIS POWERS OF SHADOWING THERE WAS NO GREAT DIFFICULTY ABOUT IT THE MAN WALKED STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM LOOKING NEITHER TO THE RIGHT NOR TO THE LEFT
5703-47212-0028 THE STRANGER TURNED INTO THE CRIANAN HOTEL WHICH STANDS ON THE LAKE FRONT FIFTY YARDS FROM THE LANDING PLACE OF THE LOCH STEAMERS GIMBLET PASSED THE DOOR WITHOUT PAUSING AND WENT DOWN TO THE LOCH WHERE HE MINGLED WITH THE BOATMEN AND LOAFERS WHO CONGREGATED BY THE WATERSIDE
5703-47212-0029 HE KEPT HOWEVER A STRICT EYE ON THE DOOR OF THE HOTEL AND AFTER A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SAW THE OBJECT OF HIS ATTENTIONS EMERGE WITH FISHING ROD AND BASKET
5703-47212-0031 AND FOR THE REST HIS NOSE WAS SHORT HIS EYES BLUE AND CLOSE TOGETHER AND HIS FOREHEAD HIGH AND NARROW HE LOOKED CLOSELY AT GIMBLET AS HE WENT BY AND FOR A MOMENT THE EYES OF THE TWO MEN MET
5703-47212-0032 BOTH EQUALLY INSCRUTABLE AND UNFLINCHING THEN THE STRANGER GLANCED ASIDE AND STRODE ON TO WHERE A SMALL BOAT LAY MOORED THE DETECTIVE TURNED HIS BACK WHILE THE FAIR MAN GOT IN AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE LOCH GENTLEMAN GOING FISHING
5703-47212-0034 ON THE PRETEXT OF ENGAGING ROOMS FOR A FRIEND THE LANDLORD WAS SORRY BUT THE HOUSE WAS FULL
5703-47212-0035 FOLKS TAK THEIR ROOMS A MONTH IN ADVANCE THEY COME HERE FOR THE FISHIN ON THE LOCH
5703-47212-0037 I SELDOM HAE AN AMERICAN BIDIN HERE THEY MAISTLY GANG DOON THE LOCH SAID THE INNKEEPER I THOUGHT SAID GIMBLET THAT WAS A FOREIGN LOOKING MAN WHOM I SAW A LITTLE WHILE AGO COMING OUT OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0038 A POLISH GINTLEMAN HE IS COUNT PRETOVSKY A VARY NICE GINTLEMAN I COULDNA JUST CAE HIM A TOURIST HE'S VARY KEEN ON THE FISHIN
5703-47212-0040 DEAR ME SAID GIMBLET JUST WHAT MY FRIEND WANTS I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T TAKE HIM IN I MUST TELL HIM TO WRITE IN GOOD TIME NEXT YEAR IF HE WANTS A ROOM AS HE PARTED FROM THE LANDLORD UPON THE DOORSTEP OF THE CRIANAN HOTEL THE ROB ROY
5703-47212-0041 THE SECOND OF THE TWO LOCH STEAMERS WAS EDGING AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER A CLOUD OF BLACK SMOKE FROM HER FUNNEL THE RAIN HAD STOPPED THE PASSENGERS WERE SCATTERED ON THE DECK
5703-47212-0043 IT WAS AS GIMBLET HAD EXPECTED AND THOUGH HE CHAFED AT THE DELAY HE REGRETTED LESS THAN HE WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THAT HE COULD NOT CATCH THE ROB ROY THE INVERASHIEL WOULD BE DUE ON HER HOMEWARD TRIP IN A COUPLE OF HOURS TIME
5703-47212-0044 AND MEANWHILE HE HAD OTHER BUSINESS THAT MUST BE ATTENDED TO HE WENT FIRST TO THE POST OFFICE WHERE HE REGISTERED AND POSTED TO SCOTLAND YARD A PACKET HE HAD BROUGHT WITH HIM THEN AFTER ASKING HIS WAY OF THE SOCIABLE LANDLORD OF THE HOTEL
5703-47212-0046 IF YOU WILL BRING ONE OF YOUR MEN AND COME WITH ME YOURSELF SAID GIMBLET AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE INTERVIEW
5703-47212-0047 IN THE MEANTIME THERE WILL BE NO HARM DONE BY A WATCH BEING KEPT ON THE FOREIGN GENTLEMAN WHO IS AT THIS MOMENT TROLLING FOR SALMON ON THE LOCH THE INSPECTOR AGREED AND WHEN THE INVERASHIEL STARTED AN HOUR LATER ON HER VOYAGE DOWN THE LOCH
5703-47212-0049 THE WEATHER WHICH FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAD LOOKED LIKE CLEARING HAD NOW TURNED DEFINITELY TO RAIN CLOUDS HAD DESCENDED ON THE HILLS AND THE TREES IN THE VALLEYS STOOPED AND DRIPPED IN THE SATURATED MIST LADEN AIR
5703-47212-0050 GIMBLET CONDUCTED THE MEN TO THE COTTAGE WHERE LADY RUTH ANXIOUSLY AWAITED THEM IF YOU DON'T MIND THEIR STAYING HERE HE SUGGESTED TO HER WHILE I GO UP TO THE CASTLE AND CONSULT LORD ASHIEL ABOUT A MAGISTRATE IT WILL BE MOST CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF THE DISTANCE
5703-47212-0052 AND I AM JUST WONDERING IF SHE HAS CHANGED HER MIND AND ACCEPTED HIM AFTER ALL GIRLS ARE KITTLE CATTLE BUT I'VE GOT QUITE FOND OF THAT ONE AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT FORGOTTEN POOR DAVID SO SOON I REALLY AM FEELING ANXIOUS ABOUT HER
5750-35690-0000 AFTER A LONG AND TEDIOUS DISCOURSE OF THESE SIX NON NATURAL THINGS AND THEIR SEVERAL RECTIFICATIONS
5750-35690-0002 BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH USE IT LEAST LIVE LONGEST
5750-35690-0003 RELATES OF THE ISLES OF ORCADES THE PEOPLE ARE STILL SOUND OF BODY AND MIND WITHOUT ANY USE OF PHYSIC
5750-35690-0005 AND VERY LONG LIVED IN WHICH PLACES THERE IS NO USE AT ALL OF PHYSIC THE NAME OF IT IS NOT ONCE HEARD DITHMARUS BLESKENIUS IN HIS ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ICELAND SIXTEEN O SEVEN
5750-35690-0006 MOST PART THEY DRINK WATER AND WHEY
5750-35690-0008 AND BUT LITTLE AT THIS DAY EXCEPT IT BE FOR A FEW NICE IDLE CITIZENS SURFEITING COURTIERS AND STALL FED GENTLEMEN LUBBERS THE COUNTRY PEOPLE USE KITCHEN PHYSIC
5750-35690-0009 MANY THAT DID ILL UNDER PHYSICIANS HANDS HAVE HAPPILY ESCAPED
5750-35690-0011 JURIDICIS MEDICIS FISCO FAS VIVERE RAPTO TIS A CORRUPT TRADE NO SCIENCE ART NO PROFESSION THE BEGINNING PRACTICE AND PROGRESS OF IT ALL IS NAUGHT FULL OF IMPOSTURE UNCERTAINTY AND DOTH GENERALLY MORE HARM THAN GOOD
5750-35690-0012 THE DEVIL HIMSELF WAS THE FIRST INVENTOR OF IT
5750-35690-0014 AESCULAPIUS HIS SON HAD HIS TEMPLES ERECTED TO HIS DEITY AND DID MANY FAMOUS CURES BUT AS LACTANTIUS HOLDS HE WAS A MAGICIAN A MERE IMPOSTOR
5750-35690-0015 PERFORMED MOST OF THEIR CURES THE FIRST THAT EVER WROTE IN PHYSIC TO ANY PURPOSE WAS HIPPOCRATES AND HIS DISCIPLE AND COMMENTATOR GALEN WHOM SCALIGER CALLS FIMBRIAM HIPPOCRATIS
5750-35690-0017 THEY THEMSELVES IDIOTS AND INFANTS AS ARE ALL THEIR ACADEMICAL FOLLOWERS THE ARABIANS RECEIVED IT FROM THE GREEKS AND SO THE LATINS ADDING NEW PRECEPTS AND MEDICINES OF THEIR OWN BUT SO IMPERFECT STILL THAT THROUGH IGNORANCE OF PROFESSORS IMPOSTORS MOUNTEBANKS EMPIRICS
5750-35690-0018 DISAGREEING OF SECTARIES WHICH ARE AS MANY ALMOST AS THERE BE DISEASES ENVY COVETOUSNESS AND THE LIKE THEY DO MUCH HARM AMONGST US
5750-35690-0020 DOTH APPROPRIATE IT TO HERSELF AND TELLS A STORY OF ONE CURTIUS A PHYSICIAN IN VENICE BECAUSE HE WAS A STRANGER AND PRACTISED AMONGST THEM THE REST OF THE PHYSICIANS DID STILL CROSS HIM IN ALL HIS PRECEPTS IF HE PRESCRIBED HOT MEDICINES THEY WOULD PRESCRIBE COLD
5750-35690-0021 MISCENTES PRO CALIDIS FRIGIDA PRO FRIGIDIS HUMIDA PRO PURGANTIBUS ASTRINGENTIA BINDERS FOR PURGATIVES OMNIA PERTURBABANT IF THE PARTY MISCARRIED CURTIUM DAMNABANT CURTIUS KILLED HIM THAT DISAGREED FROM THEM
5750-35690-0023 IS NEITHER OBSERVED NOR UNDERSTOOD OF ANY AND FOR URINE THAT IS MERETRIX MEDICORUM THE MOST DECEITFUL THING OF ALL AS FORESTUS AND SOME OTHER PHYSICIANS HAVE PROVED AT LARGE
5750-35690-0024 I HAD RATHER BELIEVE AND COMMIT MYSELF TO A MERE EMPIRIC THAN TO A MERE DOCTOR AND I CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY COMMEND THAT CUSTOM OF THE BABYLONIANS THAT HAVE NO PROFESSED PHYSICIANS BUT BRING ALL THEIR PATIENTS TO THE MARKET TO BE CURED
5750-35690-0026 A SECOND THE TEETH A THIRD THE HEAD
5750-35690-0027 I ACKNOWLEDGE IT A MOST NOBLE AND DIVINE SCIENCE
5750-35690-0029 WITH ALL VIRTUOUS AND WISE MEN THEREFORE I HONOUR THE NAME AND CALLING AS I AM ENJOINED TO HONOUR THE PHYSICIAN FOR NECESSITY'S SAKE THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PHYSICIAN LIFTETH UP HIS HEAD AND IN THE SIGHT OF GREAT MEN HE SHALL BE ADMIRED
5750-35690-0030 BUT OF THIS NOBLE SUBJECT HOW MANY PANEGYRICS ARE WORTHILY WRITTEN
5750-35690-0032 IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD OF SUCH PURGES AS ARE UNSEASONABLY OR IMMODERATELY TAKEN THEY HAVE THEIR EXCELLENT USE IN THIS AS WELL AS MOST OTHER INFIRMITIES OF ALTERATIVES AND CORDIALS NO MAN DOUBTS BE THEY SIMPLES OR COMPOUNDS
5750-100289-0000 THE CONTRARY IS TRUE WHAT WE NEED IS NOT LESS EDUCATION BUT MORE MORE TRAINED LEADERS TO UPHOLD THE STANDARDS OF CIVILIZATION BEFORE BOTH RACES AMONG INDIAN COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY GRADUATES A FAILURE IS VERY RARE
5750-100289-0002 ALTHOUGH BECAUSE OF THE WONDERFUL ATHLETIC PROWESS OF ITS STUDENTS THEY HAVE MET AND DEFEATED THE ATHLETES OF MANY A WHITE UNIVERSITY ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD
5750-100289-0003 GIVING A FAIR KNOWLEDGE OF SOME TRADE TOGETHER WITH THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ENGLISH EDUCATION BUT NO LATIN OR OTHER FOREIGN LANGUAGE CONSEQUENTLY ITS GRADUATES MUST ATTEND A HIGHER PREPARATORY SCHOOL FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THEY CAN ENTER COLLEGE
5750-100289-0005 FURTHERMORE THEY ARE ALMOST ALWAYS HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEANS NEVERTHELESS AN INCREASING NUMBER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE UNDERTAKING TRIALS OF THE EDUCATED INDIAN
5750-100289-0006 I WISH TO CONTRADICT THE POPULAR MISCONCEPTION THAT AN EDUCATED INDIAN WILL NECESSARILY MEET WITH STRONG PREJUDICE AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE OR WILL BE EDUCATED OUT OF SYMPATHY WITH THEM FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW
5750-100289-0008 HE COULD NOT BETTER HIMSELF BECAUSE THE PEOPLE REQUIRED HIM TO GIVE UNLIMITED FREE SERVICE ACCORDING TO THE OLD REGIME I HAVE EVEN KNOWN ONE TO BE KILLED BY THE CONTINUAL DEMANDS UPON HIM THERE WAS A TIME NOT SO LONG AGO EITHER
5750-100289-0009 WHEN THE EDUCATED INDIAN STOOD IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION BETWEEN HIS PEOPLE AND THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND SHADY POLITICIANS EVERY COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT TO HIM AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND HE WAS EXPECTED TO EXPOSE AND REDRESS EVERY WRONG
5750-100289-0011 FOR HIS FELLOW TRIBESMEN IN THIS MATTER I SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS LONG OBSERVATION EVEN IN THE OLD WILD DAYS AN EDUCATION WAS APPRECIATED BY THE INDIANS
5750-100289-0012 BUT IT WAS A HARD LIFE FOR THE EDUCATED MAN THEY MADE HIM CARRY TOO HEAVY A BURDEN WITHOUT MUCH RECOMPENSE SAVE HONOR AND RESPECT BUT WE HAVE PRETTY WELL PASSED THROUGH THAT PERIOD AND THE NATIVE GRADUATES OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS
5750-100289-0014 NO INFERIOR RACE IT WAS DECLARED WITHOUT QUALIFICATION BY THE UNIVERSAL RACES CONGRESS AT LONDON IN NINETEEN ELEVEN THAT THERE IS NO INHERENTLY SUPERIOR RACE
5750-100289-0015 THEREFORE NO INFERIOR RACE FROM EVERY RACE SOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE MASTERED THE SAME CURRICULUM AND PASSED THE SAME TESTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES MEMBERS OF SO CALLED UNCIVILIZED RACES
5750-100289-0017 THE VERY MENTION OF THE NAME INDIAN IN EARLIER DAYS WOULD MAKE THE AVERAGE WHITE MAN'S BLOOD CREEP WITH THOUGHTS OF THE WAR WHOOP AND THE SCALPING KNIFE
5750-100289-0018 A LITTLE LATER IT SUGGESTED CHIEFLY FEATHERS AND PAINT AND BUFFALO BILL'S WILD WEST TO DAY THE ASSOCIATION IS RATHER WITH THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND ITS FAMOUS ATHLETES
5750-100289-0020 DOCTOR BOOKER WASHINGTON IS IN THE HABIT OF SAYING JOCOSELY THAT THE NEGRO BLOOD IS THE STRONGEST IN THE WORLD FOR ONE DROP OF IT MAKES A NIGGER OF A WHITE MAN I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE INDIAN BLOOD IS EVEN STRONGER
5750-100289-0021 FOR A HALF BLOOD NEGRO AND INDIAN MAY PASS FOR AN INDIAN AND SO BE ADMITTED TO FIRST CLASS HOTELS AND EVEN TO HIGH SOCIETY
5750-100289-0023 WE WANT THE BEST IN TWO RACES AND CIVILIZATIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR WHAT WE HAVE LOST SOME OF US HAVE ENTERED UPON EVERY KNOWN PROFESSIONAL CAREER SUCH AS MEDICINE LAW THE MINISTRY EDUCATION AND THE SCIENCES
5750-100289-0024 POLITICS AND HIGHER BUSINESS MANAGEMENT ART AND LITERATURE IT MAY BE WELL TO MENTION SOME OF OUR BEST KNOWN PROFESSIONAL MEN AND WOMEN
5750-100289-0026 SOME NOTED INDIANS OF TO DAY PERHAPS THE FOREMOST OF THESE IS DOCTOR CARLOS MONTEZUMA OF CHICAGO A FULL BLOODED APACHE
5750-100289-0027 WHO WERE ENEMIES OF HIS PEOPLE HE WAS BROUGHT TO CHICAGO BY THE MAN WHO RANSOMED HIM A REPORTER AND PHOTOGRAPHER AND WHEN HIS BENEFACTOR DIED THE BOY BECAME THE PROTEGE OF THE CHICAGO PRESS CLUB
5750-100289-0029 AFTER GRADUATION DOCTOR MONTEZUMA WAS SENT BY THE GOVERNMENT AS PHYSICIAN TO AN INDIAN AGENCY IN MONTANA AND LATER TRANSFERRED TO THE CARLISLE SCHOOL IN A FEW YEARS HE RETURNED TO CHICAGO AND OPENED AN OFFICE
5750-100289-0030 HE HAS BEEN A PROMINENT PHYSICIAN THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WAS RECENTLY MARRIED TO A LADY OF GERMAN DESCENT HE STANDS UNCOMPROMISINGLY FOR THE TOTAL ABOLITION OF THE RESERVATION SYSTEM AND OF THE INDIAN BUREAU

5750-100289-0033 THERE IS ANOTHER INDIAN DOCTOR NOT OF FULL BLOOD WHO IS PRESIDENT OF THE CITY CLUB OF CHICAGO AND ACTIVE IN CIVIC REFORM IN SEVERAL MIDDLE WESTERN CITIES THERE ARE SUCCESSFUL DOCTORS AND DENTISTS OF MY RACE
5750-100289-0035 SENATOR OWEN OF OKLAHOMA IS PART CHEROKEE THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS COME TO REALIZE HIS ABILITY AND INFLUENCE REPRESENTATIVE CARTER OF OKLAHOMA IS ALSO AN INDIAN
5750-100289-0036 DURING MY STUDENT DAYS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE I WAS OFTEN TOLD THAT DANIEL WEBSTER WAS PART INDIAN ON HIS MOTHER'S SIDE CERTAINLY HIS PHYSIOGNOMY AS WELL AS HIS UNEQUALLED LOGIC CORROBORATED THE STORY
5750-100289-0038 BUT HAVE NEVER VERIFIED IT THEIR WONDERFUL AGGRESSIVENESS AND DAUNTLESS PUBLIC SERVICE IN MY MIND POINT TO NATIVE DESCENT AND IF THEY CAN TRUTHFULLY CLAIM IT

5750-100289-0047 GRADUATED FROM YALE AND OBERLIN
5750-100289-0048 HAS DONE GOOD WORK AS FIELD SECRETARY AMONG THE INDIANS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS I SHOULD ADD THAT THERE ARE MANY MINISTERS OF MY RACE WHO HAVE NO COLLEGE DEGREE NOR MUCH EDUCATION IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE YET WHO ARE AMONG OUR MOST ABLE AND INFLUENTIAL LEADERS
5750-100289-0050 MOST OF THEM IN THE UNITED STATES INDIAN SERVICE IT IS THE EXPRESS POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO USE THE EDUCATED INDIANS WHENEVER POSSIBLE IN PROMOTING THE ADVANCEMENT OF THEIR RACE INDEED SOME OF THE TREATIES INCLUDE THIS STIPULATION
5750-100289-0051 AND ALTHOUGH THEY MUST PASS A CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION TO PROVE THEIR FITNESS SUCH EXAMINATION IN THEIR CASE IS NON COMPETITIVE THEY HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN THE LARGER GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS IN MANY INSTANCES WITH THE ADDITION OF NORMAL AND COLLEGE COURSES

5750-100289-0065 AT LEAST NOT IN PUBLIC NOT LONG AFTERWARD THE GAME WAS INTRODUCED AT CARLISLE AND I WAS ASKED BY THE GENERAL TO VISIT MONTANA AND THE DAKOTAS TO SECURE PUPILS FOR THE SCHOOL AND INCIDENTALLY RECRUITS FOR HIS FOOTBALL WARRIORS
5750-100289-0066 THE INDIANS VICTORY WAS COMPLETE THESE BOYS ALWAYS FIGHT THE BATTLE ON ITS OWN MERITS THEY PLAY A CLEAN GAME AND LOSE VERY FEW GAMES DURING THE SEASON ALTHOUGH THEY MEET ALL OUR LEADING UNIVERSITIES EACH ON ITS OWN HOME GROUNDS
5750-100289-0068 THORPE IS A GRADUATE OF THE CARLISLE SCHOOL AND AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES IN SWEDEN IN NINETEEN TWELVE HE WON THE TITLE OF THE GREATEST ALL ROUND ATHLETE IN THE WORLD PROBLEMS OF RACE LEADERSHIP
5750-100289-0069 AND WITH OLD TRIBAL JEALOUSIES AND ANTAGONISMS YET TO BE OVERCOME ANOTHER AND A MORE SERIOUS OBSTACLE IS THE DEPENDENT POSITION OF THE INDIAN AND THE ALMOST ARBITRARY POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE INDIAN BUREAU
5750-100289-0071 MY BROTHER JOHN EASTMAN AND MYSELF AT THAT TIME WE CONCLUDED THAT THE MOVEMENT WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD EITHER BY OUR OWN RACE OR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN GENERAL AND THAT THERE WAS GRAVE DANGER OF AROUSING THE ANTAGONISM OF THE BUREAU
5750-100289-0072 IF SUCH A SOCIETY WERE FORMED IT WOULD NECESSARILY TAKE MANY PROBLEMS OF THE RACE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE OFFICIALS AT WASHINGTON AND IN THE FIELD ARE SENSITIVE TO CRITICISM
5750-100289-0074 VERY FEW INDIANS ARE SUFFICIENTLY INDEPENDENT OF THE BUREAU TO SPEAK AND ACT WITH ABSOLUTE FREEDOM SOME TEN YEARS LATER I WAS CALLED TO COLUMBUS OHIO TO LECTURE FOR THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY
5750-100289-0075 ON THE SAME COURSE WITH DOCTOR COOLIDGE AND DOCTOR MONTEZUMA PROFESSOR F A MC KENZIE OF THE UNIVERSITY ARRANGED THE COURSE AND SOON AFTERWARD HE WROTE ME THAT HE BELIEVED THE TIME WAS NOW RIPE TO ORGANIZE OUR SOCIETY
5750-100289-0077 AND MISS LAURA CORNELIUS WE ORGANIZED AS A COMMITTEE AND ISSUED A GENERAL CALL FOR A CONFERENCE IN OCTOBER AT THE UNIVERSITY UPON THE CORDIAL INVITATION OF DOCTOR MC KENZIE AND PRESIDENT THOMPSON
5750-100289-0078 FOUR ANNUAL CONFERENCES HAVE NOW BEEN HELD AND THE FIFTH IS ANNOUNCED FOR NEXT OCTOBER AT OKLAHOMA CITY THE SOCIETY HAS FIVE HUNDRED ACTIVE AND ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF ASSOCIATE MEMBERS
5750-100289-0080 AND ARTHUR C PARKER IS SECRETARY AND TREASURER THE SOCIETY OF AMERICAN INDIANS ISSUES A QUARTERLY JOURNAL DEVOTED TO THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONFERENCES AND THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIAN RACE
5750-100289-0081 AND THERE ARE OTHERS AS WELL OUR PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED TO WORK TOGETHER HARMONIOUSLY IT IS A SERIOUS QUESTION WHAT PRINCIPLES WE SHOULD STAND FOR AND WHAT LINE OF WORK WE OUGHT TO UNDERTAKE
5750-100289-0083 AND SIMPLY AIM AT AROUSING RACIAL PRIDE AND AMBITION ALONG NEW LINES HOLDING UP A MODERN IDEAL FOR THE SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT OF OUR YOUTH SHOULD WE PETITION CONGRESS AND IN GENERAL CONTINUE ALONG THE LINES OF THE OLDER INDIAN ASSOCIATIONS
5750-100289-0084 OR SHOULD WE RATHER DO INTENSIVE WORK AMONG OUR PEOPLE LOOKING ESPECIALLY TOWARD THEIR MORAL AND SOCIAL WELFARE I STAND FOR THE LATTER PLAN OTHERS THINK DIFFERENTLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT A WASHINGTON OFFICE HAS BEEN OPENED
5750-100289-0086 TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE NATURAL LAWS OF SOCIAL EVOLUTION SECOND TO PROVIDE THROUGH OUR OPEN CONFERENCES THE MEANS FOR A FREE DISCUSSION ON ALL SUBJECTS BEARING ON THE WELFARE OF THE RACE THIRD
5750-100289-0087 TO PRESENT IN A JUST LIGHT THE TRUE HISTORY OF THE RACE TO PRESERVE ITS RECORDS AND EMULATE ITS DISTINGUISHING VIRTUES FOURTH TO PROMOTE CITIZENSHIP AND TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS THEREOF FIFTH
5778-12761-0000 CONTINUATION OF FREMONT'S ACCOUNT OF THE PASSAGE THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS WE HAD HARD AND DOUBTFUL LABOR YET BEFORE US AS THE SNOW APPEARED TO BE HEAVIER WHERE THE TIMBER BEGAN FURTHER DOWN WITH FEW OPEN SPOTS
5778-12761-0001 ASCENDING A HEIGHT WE TRACED OUT THE BEST LINE WE COULD DISCOVER FOR THE NEXT DAY'S MARCH AND HAD AT LEAST THE CONSOLATION TO SEE THAT THE MOUNTAIN DESCENDED RAPIDLY THE DAY HAD BEEN ONE OF APRIL GUSTY WITH A FEW OCCASIONAL FLAKES OF SNOW
5778-12761-0003 FOR US AS CONNECTED WITH THE IDEA OF SUMMER IT HAD A SINGULAR CHARM AND WE WATCHED ITS PROGRESS WITH EXCITED FEELINGS UNTIL NEARLY SUNSET
5778-12761-0004 WHEN THE SKY CLEARED OFF BRIGHTLY AND WE SAW A SHINING LINE OF WATER DIRECTING ITS COURSE TOWARDS ANOTHER A BROADER AND LARGER SHEET WE KNEW THAT THESE COULD BE NO OTHER THAN THE SACRAMENTO AND THE BAY OF SAN FRANCISCO
5778-12761-0006 WE WERE YET ALMOST AFRAID TO BELIEVE THAT WE WERE AT LAST TO ESCAPE INTO THE GENIAL COUNTRY OF WHICH WE HAVE HEARD SO MANY GLOWING DESCRIPTIONS AND DREADED AGAIN TO FIND SOME VAST INTERIOR LAKE WHOSE BITTER WATERS WOULD BRING US DISAPPOINTMENT
5778-12761-0007 ON THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE THE BAY COULD BE TRACED THE GLEAMING LINE WHERE ENTERED ANOTHER LARGE STREAM AND AGAIN THE BUENAVENTURA ROSE UP IN OUR MIND
5778-12761-0009 WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST THERE WERE PEOPLE BELOW FIRES WERE LIT UP IN THE VALLEY JUST AT NIGHT APPEARING TO BE IN ANSWER TO OURS AND THESE SIGNS OF LIFE RENEWED IN SOME MEASURE THE GAYETY OF THE CAMP
5778-12761-0010 THEY APPEARED SO NEAR THAT WE JUDGED THEM TO BE AMONG THE TIMBER OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORING RIDGES BUT HAVING THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW DAY AFTER DAY AND NIGHT AFTER NIGHT WE AFTERWARDS FOUND THEM TO BE FIRES THAT HAD BEEN KINDLED BY THE INDIANS AMONG THE TULARES
5778-12761-0012 CARSON SPRANG OVER CLEAR ACROSS A PLACE WHERE THE STREAM WAS COMPRESSED AMONG ROCKS BUT THE PARFLECHE SOLE OF MY MOCCASIN GLANCED FROM THE ICY ROCK AND PRECIPITATED ME INTO THE RIVER
5778-12761-0013 IT WAS SOME FEW SECONDS BEFORE I COULD RECOVER MYSELF IN THE CURRENT AND CARSON THINKING ME HURT JUMPED IN AFTER ME AND WE BOTH HAD AN ICY BATH WE TRIED TO SEARCH A WHILE FOR MY GUN WHICH HAD BEEN LOST IN THE FALL
5778-12761-0015 THE SKY WAS CLEAR AND PURE WITH A SHARP WIND FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE THERMOMETER TWENTY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT WE CONTINUED DOWN THE SOUTH FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN OUR ROAD LEADING OVER DRY GROUND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID THE SNOW ALMOST ENTIRELY
5778-12761-0016 IN THE COURSE OF THE MORNING WE STRUCK A FOOT PATH WHICH WE WERE GENERALLY ABLE TO KEEP AND THE GROUND WAS SOFT TO OUR ANIMALS FEET BEING SANDY OR COVERED WITH MOULD GREEN GRASS BEGAN TO MAKE ITS APPEARANCE
5778-12761-0018 WE MEASURED ONE THAT HAD TEN FEET DIAMETER THOUGH THE HEIGHT WAS NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET ALL ALONG THE RIVER WAS A ROARING TORRENT ITS FALL VERY GREAT AND DESCENDING WITH A RAPIDITY TO WHICH WE HAD LONG BEEN STRANGERS
5778-12761-0019 TO OUR GREAT PLEASURE OAK TREES APPEARED ON THE RIDGE AND SOON BECAME VERY FREQUENT ON THESE I REMARKED UNUSUALLY GREAT QUANTITIES OF MISTLETOE THE OPPOSITE MOUNTAIN SIDE WAS VERY STEEP AND CONTINUOUS
5778-12761-0021 CONTINUING ON WE HALTED A MOMENT AT ONE OF THESE RIVULETS TO ADMIRE SOME BEAUTIFUL EVERGREEN TREES RESEMBLING LIVE OAK WHICH SHADED THE LITTLE STREAM
5778-12761-0022 THEY WERE FORTY TO FIFTY FEET HIGH AND TWO IN DIAMETER WITH A UNIFORM TUFTED TOP AND THE SUMMER GREEN OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL FOLIAGE WITH THE SINGING BIRDS AND THE SWEET SUMMER WIND WHICH WAS WHIRLING ABOUT THE DRY OAK LEAVES
5778-12761-0024 I STARTED AHEAD THIS MORNING WITH A PARTY OF EIGHT CONSISTING WITH MYSELF
5778-12761-0025 AND JACOB WE TOOK WITH US SOME OF THE BEST ANIMALS AND MY INTENTION WAS TO PROCEED AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE HOUSE OF MISTER SUTTER AND RETURN TO MEET THE PARTY WITH A SUPPLY OF PROVISIONS AND FRESH ANIMALS
5778-12761-0027 LIFE YET SAID HE AS HE CAME UP LIFE YET I HAVE FOUND A HILLSIDE SPRINKLED WITH GRASS ENOUGH FOR THE NIGHT
5778-12761-0028 WE DROVE ALONG OUR HORSES AND ENCAMPED AT THE PLACE ABOUT DARK AND THERE WAS JUST ROOM ENOUGH TO MAKE A PLACE FOR SHELTER ON THE EDGE OF THE STREAM THREE HORSES WERE LOST TODAY PROVEAU
5778-12761-0030 CARSON AND I CLIMBED ONE OF THE NEAREST MOUNTAINS THE FOREST LAND STILL EXTENDED AHEAD AND THE VALLEY APPEARED AS FAR AS EVER
5778-12761-0031 WE BEGAN TO BE UNEASY AT DEROSIER'S ABSENCE FEARING HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN BEWILDERED IN THE WOODS CHARLES TOWNS WHO HAD NOT YET RECOVERED HIS MIND WENT TO SWIM IN THE RIVER AS IF IT WAS SUMMER AND THE STREAM PLACID
5778-12761-0033 HE CAME IN AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO TELL US WHERE HE HAD BEEN HE IMAGINED HE HAD BEEN GONE SEVERAL DAYS AND THOUGHT WE WERE STILL AT THE CAMP WHERE HE HAD LEFT US AND WE WERE PAINED TO SEE THAT HIS MIND WAS DERANGED
5778-12761-0034 IT APPEARED THAT HE HAD BEEN LOST IN THE MOUNTAIN AND HUNGER AND FATIGUE JOINED TO WEAKNESS OF BODY AND FEAR OF PERISHING IN THE MOUNTAINS HAD CRAZED HIM THE TIMES WERE SEVERE WHEN STOUT MEN LOST THEIR MINDS FROM EXTREMITY OF SUFFERING
5778-12761-0036 AND UNAWARE THAT WE HAD ENCAMPED SO EARLY IN THE DAY WAS LOST WHEN NIGHT ARRIVED AND HE DID NOT COME IN WE BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO MAKE ANY SEARCH
5778-12761-0037 WE FOLLOWED MISTER PREUSS'S TRAIL FOR A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE ALONG THE RIVER UNTIL WE REACHED A PLACE WHERE HE HAD DESCENDED TO THE STREAM BELOW AND ENCAMPED HERE WE SHOUTED AND FIRED GUNS BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER
5778-12761-0039 AND OAKS BECAME THE PRINCIPAL TREES OF THE FOREST AMONG THESE THE PREVAILING TREE WAS THE EVERGREEN OAK WHICH BY WAY OF DISTINCTION WE SHALL CALL THE LIVE OAK
5778-12761-0040 AND WITH THESE OCCURRED FREQUENTLY A NEW SPECIES OF OAK BEARING A LONG SLENDER ACORN FROM AN INCH TO AN INCH AND A HALF IN LENGTH WHICH WE NOW BEGAN TO SEE FORMED THE PRINCIPAL VEGETABLE FOOD OF THE INHABITANTS OF THIS REGION
5778-12761-0042 AND WE SAT DOWN FOR A WHILE IN THE SHADE OF THE OAKS TO LET THE ANIMALS FEED WE REPEATED OUR SHOUTS FOR MISTER PREUSS AND THIS TIME WE WERE GRATIFIED WITH AN ANSWER THE VOICE GREW RAPIDLY NEARER ASCENDING FROM THE RIVER
5778-12761-0043 BUT WHEN WE EXPECTED TO SEE HIM EMERGE IT CEASED ENTIRELY WE HAD CALLED UP SOME STRAGGLING INDIAN THE FIRST WE HAD MET ALTHOUGH FOR TWO DAYS BACK WE HAD SEEN TRACKS
5778-12761-0045 SUDDENLY APPEARED IN HIS PATH IGNORANT OF THE CHARACTER OF THESE PEOPLE WE HAD NOW ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF UNEASINESS IN REGARD TO MISTER PREUSS HE HAD NO ARMS WITH HIM AND WE BEGAN TO THINK HIS CHANCE DOUBTFUL
5778-12761-0046 AT ONE OF THESE ORCHARD GROUNDS WE ENCAMPED ABOUT NOON TO MAKE AN EFFORT FOR MISTER PREUSS ONE MAN TOOK HIS WAY ALONG A SPUR LEADING INTO THE RIVER IN HOPE TO CROSS HIS TRAIL AND ANOTHER TOOK OUR OWN BACK
5778-12761-0048 AT THE END OF FOUR DAYS MISTER PREUSS SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED HIS FRIENDS BY WALKING INTO CAMP HE HAD LIVED ON ROOTS AND ACORNS AND WAS IN THE LAST STAGES OF EXHAUSTION
5778-12761-0049 SHORTLY THE ADVANCE PARTY REACHED SUTTER'S FORT WHERE THEY RECEIVED THE MOST HOSPITABLE TREATMENT
5778-54535-0001 BUT FIND ME SOMEWHERE AN ENGINEER THAT WILL LAY OUT A PERFECT RAILROAD LINE MEN APPOINTED BY THIS COLONEL TRAVELED SOME MONTHS THEY VISITED MANY CITIES WROTE LETTERS AND ASKED ADVICE THEN THE COLONEL WENT BACK TO THE EMPEROR AND SAID
5778-54535-0002 THE MAN YOU NEED TO DO THIS PIECE OF WORK LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHAT'S HIS NAME ASKED NICOLAS HE IS MAJOR GEORGE WASHINGTON WHISTLER HE IS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE CITY IN WHICH HE LIVES LOWELL MASSACHUSETTS
5778-54535-0004 THE MAJOR MADE HASTE TO START FOR RUSSIA BECAUSE THE HONOR WAS GREAT AND THE PAYMENT WOULD BE GENEROUS HE LEFT HIS BOYS AND HIS WIFE BEHIND BECAUSE HE DID NOT KNOW JUST HOW COMFORTABLE HE COULD MAKE THEM IN THE FAR OFF COUNTRY
5778-54535-0005 BUT HE TOLD THE BOYS TO BE GOOD AND TO MIND THEIR MOTHER THESE BOYS WERE NAMED JAMES MC NEILL WILLIAM AND CHARLES THEIR MOTHER WAS A FINE WOMAN BUT SOMETIMES THEY WISHED SHE WOULD NOT BE QUITE SO STRICT
5778-54535-0007 BUT JAMES LIKED THE STORIES HE FOUND THERE AND WHEN HE WAS ONLY NINE COULD SAY ALMOST HALF THE BIBLE BY HEART JAMES WAS THE OLDEST IN THE FAMILY HE WAS BORN IN LOWELL AND WAS SUCH A CUNNING BABY THAT EVERYBODY WANTED HIS PICTURE
5778-54535-0008 ONE OF HIS UNCLES WHO LOVED HIM DEARLY USED TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS THIS WAS A GREAT ENGLISH PAINTER WHO HAD DIED YEARS BEFORE COME OUT OF HIS GRAVE TO PAINT JIMMIE ASLEEP
5778-54535-0010 MORE THAN ALL HIS PLAYTHINGS HE LIKED A PENCIL AND PAPER FROM THE TIME HE COULD SCRIBBLE AT ALL HE DREW PICTURES OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN SIGHT
5778-54535-0011 THESE PICTURES WERE VERY GOOD AND WHEN HE WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO GO TO SCHOOL THE OTHER CHILDREN WERE APT TO ASK HIM TO MAKE ANIMALS AND BIRDS FOR THEM ON THE BLACKBOARD MAJOR WHISTLER SOON SENT FOR HIS FAMILY TO JOIN HIM IN RUSSIA
5778-54535-0013 THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE LITTLE RUSSIAN CHILDREN OR IN LEARNING THE LANGUAGE THEY WENT SKATING DRESSED IN HANDSOME FURS THEY LEARNED THE FOLK AND FANCY DANCES JOINED IN THE WINTER SPORTS AND VOTED RUSSIA A FINE COUNTRY
5778-54535-0014 STILL THEIR PARENTS DID NOT LET THEM FORGET THEY WERE LITTLE AMERICANS THE CLIMATE DID NOT AGREE WITH JAMES AND EVERY TIME HE CAUGHT COLD HE HAD TOUCHES OF RHEUMATISM SO THAT OFTEN HE HAD TO STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HAVE HIS FEET PUT IN HOT WATER
5778-54535-0016 THAT OLD TIRESOME RHEUMATISM KEPT BOTHERING HIM AND BY AND BY HE HAD A LONG RHEUMATIC FEVER
5778-54535-0017 HE WAS A DEAR PATIENT BOY HOWEVER AND AFTERWARDS DECLARED HE WAS ALMOST GLAD HE HAD IT BECAUSE SOME ONE WHO PITIED THE SMALL INVALID SENT HIM A BOOK OF HOGARTH'S ENGRAVINGS
5778-54535-0019 JAMES WAS VERY CAREFUL OF HIS MOTHER TOO ONE EVENING SHE HAD TAKEN THE BOYS IN A CARRIAGE TO SEE A BIG ILLUMINATION BANDS WERE PLAYING AND ROCKETS FLYING
5778-54535-0020 THE HORSES NEXT THEIR CARRIAGE WERE FRIGHTENED AND REARED AND PLUNGED AS IF THEY WOULD HIT THE WHISTLER PARTY JAMES SHOVED HIS MOTHER DOWN ON THE SEAT BEHIND HIM AND STANDING IN FRONT OF HER BEAT THE HORSES BACK FROM THEM
5778-54535-0022 THE EMPEROR WAS FOND OF THE TWO BOYS AND WANTED THEM TO STAY ON IN RUSSIA AND BE TRAINED IN THE SCHOOL FOR PAGES OF THE COURT BUT THEIR MOTHER SAID THEY MUST GROW UP IN AMERICA AND HURRIED BACK TO HER OWN LAND
5778-54535-0023 SHE DID NOT HAVE MUCH MONEY TO SPEND BUT THOUGHT JAMES SHOULD GO TO WEST POINT TO GET THE MILITARY TRAINING HIS FATHER HAD HAD AT THIS ACADEMY HE FOUND HE DID NOT LIKE TO DRAW MAPS AND FORTS NEARLY AS WELL AS HE DID HUMAN FIGURES AND FACES
5778-54535-0025 JAMES WAS A TALL HANDSOME YOUNG FELLOW AT THIS TIME AND LIKED TO GO ABOUT TO DANCING PARTIES IN THE EVENING HE EARNED VERY LITTLE MAKING MAPS AND COULD NOT AFFORD TO BUY THE REAL NARROW TAILED COAT WHICH WAS PROPER
5778-54535-0026 SO HE USED TO TAKE HIS FROCK COAT THAT HE WORE ALL DAY AND PIN IT BACK TO LOOK LIKE A DRESS COAT AND START OFF FOR BIG BALLS WHERE NOBODY WAS MUCH SHOCKED BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS DOING DROLL THINGS AND WAS SO LIVELY THAT HE WAS WELCOME IN ANY DRESS
5778-54535-0028 HE WORKED QUITE STEADILY AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO SAY I THINK YOUNG WHISTLER IS GOING TO DO GREAT THINGS SOME DAY BUT SUDDENLY HE PACKED UP AND WENT TO LONDON
5778-54535-0029 IN THIS CITY HE WAS PRAISED EVEN MORE BUT HE DID NOT SELL ENOUGH PICTURES TO PAY HIS BILLS AND ONCE WHEN HE HAD KEPT MEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR MONEY THAT HE OWED THEM OFFICERS CAME AND TOOK EVERYTHING AWAY BUT HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0031 IT WAS FORTUNATE THAT JAMES COULD GO A LONG TIME WITHOUT FOOD FOR IT TOOK NEARLY ALL HE COULD EARN FROM HIS PICTURES TO BUY PAINT AND CANVAS FOR OTHERS I DARE SAY THAT QUITE OFTEN WHEN IT WAS SAID
5778-54535-0032 JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER IS GROWING RUDE AND CROSS THE REAL TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT JAMES MC NEILL WHISTLER WAS HUNGRY AND WORRIED
5778-54535-0034 MISTER RUSKIN SPOKE AND WHAT WAS WORSE PRINTED HIS OPINION I NEVER EXPECTED HE WROTE TO HEAR A COXCOMB ASK TWO HUNDRED GUINEAS FOR FLINGING A POT OF PAINT IN THE PUBLIC'S FACE
5778-54535-0035 WELL IT DID NOT LOOK FOR A WHILE AS IF THERE WAS ANY MORE GOOD LUCK IN THE WORLD FOR JAMES WHISTLER HE DID NOT LOSE ANY TIME IN GETTING A LAWYER TO SUE MISTER RUSKIN FOR SPOILING THE SALE OF HIS PICTURES
5778-54535-0037 BUT EVEN MORE MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO HEAR THE SHARP QUESTIONS OF THE LAWYERS AND THE CLEVER ANSWERS OF RUSKIN AND WHISTLER WHISTLER WON THE CASE WHEN THE JUDGE AWARDED ONE FARTHING FOR DAMAGES THIS IS ONLY A QUARTER OF A CENT IN OUR MONEY
5778-54535-0038 WHISTLER LAUGHED AND HUNG THE ENGLISH FARTHING ON HIS WATCH CHAIN FOR A CHARM MISTER RUSKIN HAD TO PAY THE COSTS OF THE TRIAL WHICH HAD MOUNTED UP TO NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS SOME OF HIS FRIENDS INSISTED ON RAISING THAT SUM FOR HIM
5778-54535-0040 TWO FAMOUS ONES OF WHICH WE OFTEN SEE PRINTS ARE PORTRAIT OF MY MOTHER AND THE SCOTCH WRITER CARLYLE JAMES WHISTLER'S MOTHER LIVED TO BE AN OLD WOMAN AS ONE CAN GUESS FROM THE PICTURE
5778-54535-0041 AND HER SON LOVED HER JUST AS DEARLY AS HE DID WHEN HE BEAT THE PRANCING HORSES AWAY FROM HER IN RUSSIA THE FRENCH NATION BOUGHT THIS PORTRAIT AND IT HANGS IN THE LUXEMBOURG MUSEUM PARIS
5778-54535-0043 THE DUET ONE OF HIS PICTURES SHOWS HIS WIFE AND HER SISTER AT THE PIANO TWO PORTRAITS BY THIS AMERICAN ARTIST HANG IN THE BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BUT MOST OF THEM ARE OWNED IN ENGLAND
5778-54535-0044 JAMES WHISTLER WAS ALWAYS KIND TO YOUNG ARTISTS AND LIKED TO HAVE THEM SIT BY HIM WHILE HE WORKED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO BE NOTICED BY HIM FOR LONG BEFORE HE DIED HE HAD RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF HONORS AND MEDALS FROM FOREIGN ACADEMIES
5778-54535-0046 HE LOVED ART SO WELL THAT HE MADE WATER COLORS PASTELS ETCHINGS AND LITHOGRAPHS AS WELL AS OIL PAINTINGS HE DID NOT GET HIS FAME WITHOUT MUCH HARD WORK
5778-54535-0047 YOU REMEMBER HOW MANY TIMES HE COPIED HIS OWN FOOT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WELL HE WAS JUST AS PATIENT AND THOROUGH WHEN HE WAS OLDER FOR A LONG TIME HE MADE A PRACTICE OF DRAWING A PICTURE OF HIMSELF EVERY NIGHT BEFORE HE WENT TO BED
5789-57158-0000 ON THAT SAME WEDNESDAY REGINALD MORTON HAD CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE HAD ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS AND HAD FOUND HER ALONE MISSUS MASTERS AT THE TIME HAD BEEN OUT
5789-57158-0001 PICKING UP INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE GREAT CASE AND THE TWO YOUNGER GIRLS HAD BEEN AT SCHOOL REGINALD AS HE WALKED HOME FROM BRAGTON ALL ALONE ON THAT OCCASION WHEN LARRY HAD RETURNED WITH MARY WAS QUITE SURE
5789-57158-0003 BUT ON THIS WEDNESDAY HE RECEIVED A LETTER AND AS HE TOLD HIMSELF MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THAT LETTER HE CALLED AT THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE AND ASKED FOR MISS MASTERS
5789-57158-0004 SHE WANTS YOU TO GO TO HER AT CHELTENHAM FOR A MONTH OH MISTER MORTON WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO HOW SHOULD I NOT LIKE TO GO LADY USHANT IS MY DEAREST DEAREST FRIEND IT IS SO VERY GOOD OF HER TO THINK OF ME
5789-57158-0006 THERE WERE MANY REASONS SHE COULD HARDLY GO ON SUCH A VISIT WITHOUT SOME RENEWAL OF HER SCANTY WARDROBE WHICH PERHAPS THE FAMILY FUNDS WOULD NOT PERMIT
5789-57158-0007 AND AS SHE KNEW VERY WELL MISSUS MASTERS WAS NOT AT ALL FAVOURABLE TO LADY USHANT IF THE OLD LADY HAD ALTOGETHER KEPT MARY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VERY WELL BUT SHE HAD NOT DONE SO
5789-57158-0009 THAT HER ONLY ESCAPE FROM HOME WOULD BE BY BECOMING MISSUS TWENTYMAN I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE MISTER MORTON MY AUNT WILL BE VERY SORRY OH HOW SORRY SHALL I BE
5789-57158-0010 IT IS LIKE HAVING ANOTHER LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN BEFORE ME THEN HE SAID WHAT HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID I THOUGHT MISS MASTERS THAT YOUR HEAVEN WAS ALL HERE WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT MISTER MORTON
5789-57158-0012 AND NOW HE WAS TELLING HER WHAT HE THOUGHT I FANCIED THAT YOU WERE HAPPY HERE WITHOUT GOING TO SEE AN OLD WOMAN WHO AFTER ALL
5789-57158-0013 I DON'T WANT ANY AMUSEMENT AT ANY RATE YOU WILL ANSWER LADY USHANT OF COURSE I SHALL ANSWER HER PERHAPS YOU CAN LET ME KNOW SHE WISHES ME TO TAKE YOU TO CHELTENHAM I SHALL GO FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS BUT I SHALL NOT STAY LONGER
5789-57158-0015 I CAN EXPLAIN IT ALL TO HER AND SHE WILL UNDERSTAND ME SHE HARDLY MEANT TO REPROACH HIM SHE DID NOT MEAN TO ASSUME AN INTIMACY SUFFICIENT FOR REPROACH BUT HE FELT THAT SHE HAD REPROACHED HIM
5789-57158-0016 AT ANY RATE I WILL WRITE TO LADY USHANT AND WILL ASK PAPA TO LET YOU KNOW THEN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THERE WERE NOTHING ELSE FOR HIM BUT TO GO AND YET HE WANTED TO SAY SOME OTHER WORD
5789-57158-0018 BECAUSE LADY USHANT IS KIND TO ME I NEEDN'T EXPECT OTHER PEOPLE TO BE SO REGINALD MORTON WAS OF COURSE THE OTHER PEOPLE THEN HE PAUSED A MOMENT I DID SO LONG HE SAID
5789-57158-0019 TO WALK ROUND THE OLD PLACE WITH YOU THE OTHER DAY BEFORE THESE PEOPLE CAME THERE AND I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU WOULD NOT COME WITH ME I WAS COMING BUT YOU WENT BACK WITH THAT OTHER MAN
5789-57158-0021 I WISHED SO MUCH TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE OLD DAYS AND I WISH TO GO TO YOUR AUNT MISTER MORTON BUT WE CAN'T ALL OF US HAVE WHAT WE WISH OF COURSE I SAW THAT YOU WERE VERY ANGRY BUT I COULDN'T HELP THAT
5789-57158-0022 A MAN MAY WISH TO HAVE A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH A VERY OLD FRIEND WITHOUT BEING INTERRUPTED AND YET NOT BE GRAND I DARE SAY MISTER TWENTYMAN IS JUST AS GOOD AS I AM
5789-57158-0024 HE HAD COME THERE ARDENTLY WISHING THAT SHE MIGHT BE ALLOWED TO GO TO HIS AUNT AND RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD TAKE HER HIMSELF IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NOW HE ALMOST THOUGHT THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT GO
5789-57158-0025 IF SHE HAD MADE HER ELECTION SHE MUST BE ALLOWED TO ABIDE BY IT IF SHE MEANT TO MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN WHAT GOOD COULD SHE GET BY ASSOCIATING WITH HIS AUNT OR WITH HIM
5789-57158-0027 SO HE WALKED BY THE PATH ACROSS THE BRIDGE AND WHEN HE CAME OUT ON THE GRAVEL ROAD NEAR THE FRONT DOOR HE FOUND A GENTLEMAN SMOKING A CIGAR AND LOOKING AROUND HIM
5789-57158-0028 THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH MUST BE NARRATED IN THE NEXT CHAPTER THE SENATOR LIFTED HIS HAT AND REMARKED THAT IT WAS A VERY FINE AFTERNOON REGINALD LIFTED HIS HAT AND ASSENTED
5789-57158-0030 YOU LIVE IN THESE PARTS SIR ASKED THE SENATOR IN THE TOWN YONDER BECAUSE MISTER MORTON'S HOUSEKEEPER SEEMS TO KNOW YOU SHE KNOWS ME VERY WELL AS I WAS BROUGHT UP IN THIS HOUSE GOOD MORNING TO YOU
5789-57158-0031 GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL ME WHO LIVES IN THAT COUNTRY RESIDENCE WHAT YOU CALL A FARM HOUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD REGINALD SAID THAT HE PRESUMED THE GENTLEMAN WAS ALLUDING TO MISTER TWENTYMAN'S HOUSE
5789-57158-0033 AH YES HE DIDN'T LIKE TO SAY UNCLE BECAUSE REGINALD DIDN'T LOOK OLD ENOUGH AND HE KNEW HE OUGHT NOT TO SAY BROTHER BECAUSE THE ELDER BROTHER IN ENGLAND WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE HAD THE PROPERTY I AM MISTER JOHN MORTON'S COUSIN
5789-57158-0034 I ASKED WHETHER YOU WERE THE OWNER OF THAT FARM HOUSE BECAUSE I INTRUDED JUST NOW BY PASSING THROUGH THE YARDS AND I WOULD HAVE APOLOGIZED GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU SIR THEN REGINALD HAVING THUS DONE HIS DUTY
5789-57158-0036 AND THAT SHE HAD SAID IT ON PURPOSE TO PUNISH THE MAN WHO WAS TALKING TO HER NOT A DAY PASSED OR HARDLY AN HOUR OF A DAY IN WHICH SHE DID NOT TELL HERSELF THAT THE EDUCATION SHE HAD RECEIVED AND THE EARLY ASSOCIATIONS OF HER LIFE
5789-57195-0000 PROVIDENCE INTERFERES THE BATTLE WAS CARRIED ON VERY FIERCELY IN MISTER MASTERS HOUSE IN DILLSBOROUGH TO THE MISERY OF ALL WITHIN IT
5789-57195-0002 THEY COULD QUARREL WITH THEIR ELDER SISTER WHILE THE ASSURANCE WAS STILL WITH THEM THAT SHE WOULD BE THERE TO FORGIVE THEM BUT NOW THAT SHE WAS GOING AWAY AND THAT IT HAD COME TO BE BELIEVED BY BOTH OF THEM THAT POOR LAWRENCE HAD NO CHANCE
5789-57195-0003 THEY WERE SAD AND DOWNHEARTED IN ALL THAT MISERY THE POOR ATTORNEY HAD THE WORST OF IT MARY WAS FREE FROM HER STEPMOTHER'S ZEAL AND HER STEPMOTHER'S PERSECUTION AT ANY RATE AT NIGHT
5789-57195-0005 SHE WOULD STILL COME AGAIN TO THE BATTLE A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT WOULD SHE SAID BRING LARRY TWENTYMAN BACK TO HIS COURTSHIP AND THAT WORD MIGHT BE SPOKEN IF MARY'S VISIT TO CHELTENHAM WERE FORBIDDEN
5789-57195-0006 LET MARY ONCE BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE A FINE LADY AND THEN SHE WOULD MARRY MISTER TWENTYMAN QUICK ENOUGH BUT THIS USHANTING THIS JOURNEYING TO CHELTENHAM IN ORDER THAT NOTHING MIGHT BE DONE
5789-57195-0008 IN ALL THESE DISPUTES HE NEVER QUITE YIELDED THOUGH HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM HE WAS STILL FIRM HE WOULD TURN HIS BACK TO HIS WIFE AND LET HER RUN ON WITH HER ARGUMENTS WITHOUT A WORD OF ANSWER
5789-57195-0009 BUT AT LAST THERE CAME TO HER A GLEAM OF HOPE MOST UNEXPECTEDLY IT HAD BEEN SETTLED THAT MARY SHOULD MAKE HER JOURNEY ON FRIDAY THE TWELFTH FEBRUARY AND THAT REGINALD MORTON WAS AGAIN TO ACCOMPANY HER
5789-57195-0011 NOBODY WOULD EAT HER MISSUS MASTERS DECLARED BUT REGINALD WAS FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF ACCOMPANYING HER HE HAD NO OBJECTION WHATEVER TO THE SECOND CLASS IF MISTER MASTERS PREFERRED IT
5789-57195-0012 THEN THERE CAME A SUDDEN DISRUPTION TO ALL THESE PLANS AND A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF HER HOPES TO MISSUS MASTERS
5789-57195-0014 HAD EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO SEE HER AND WITH THAT WISH SHE WAS BOUND TO COMPLY OF COURSE SHE SAID SHE WOULD SEE MARY AT BRAGTON OR IF THAT WERE NOT POSSIBLE SHE HERSELF WOULD COME INTO DILLSBOROUGH
5789-57195-0015 SHE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE THE LENGTH OF HER VISIT BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER SHE HOPED THAT MARY WOULD RETURN WITH HER TO CHELTENHAM THE OLD LADY'S LETTER TO REGINALD WAS MUCH LONGER BECAUSE IN THAT SHE HAD TO SPEAK OF THE STATE OF JOHN MORTON'S HEALTH
5789-57195-0017 THEN SHE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM ALLUDING TO THE FACT THAT IF ANYTHING WERE TO HAPPEN TO JOHN MORTON REGINALD HIMSELF WOULD BE THE SQUIRE OF BRAGTON REGINALD WHEN HE RECEIVED THIS AT ONCE WENT OVER TO THE ATTORNEY'S HOUSE
5789-57195-0018 BUT HE DID NOT SUCCEED IN SEEING MARY HE LEARNED HOWEVER THAT THEY WERE ALL AWARE THAT THE JOURNEY HAD BEEN POSTPONED TO MISSUS MASTERS IT SEEMED THAT ALL THIS HAD BEEN A DISPENSATION OF PROVIDENCE
5789-57195-0020 WHEN THIS WAS RECEIVED THE POOR MAN WAS SMOKING HIS MOODY PIPE IN SILENCE AS HE ROAMED ABOUT HIS OWN FARMYARD IN THE DARKNESS OF THE NIGHT
5789-57195-0021 HE HAD NOT AS YET KNOWN ANY COMFORT AND WAS STILL FIRM IN HIS PURPOSE OF SELLING THE FARM HE HAD BEEN OUT HUNTING ONCE OR TWICE BUT FANCIED THAT PEOPLE LOOKED AT HIM WITH PECULIAR EYES

5789-70653-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE INQUEST THE CORONER WHO FULLY REALIZED THAT FOR THAT ONE DAY OF HIS LIFE AS A PROVINCIAL SOLICITOR HE WAS LIVING IN THE GAZE OF THE WORLD HAD RESOLVED TO BE WORTHY OF THE FLEETING EMINENCE
5789-70653-0001 HE WAS A LARGE MAN OF JOVIAL TEMPER WITH A STRONG INTEREST IN THE DRAMATIC ASPECTS OF HIS WORK AND THE NEWS OF MANDERSON'S MYSTERIOUS DEATH WITHIN HIS JURISDICTION HAD MADE HIM THE HAPPIEST CORONER IN ENGLAND
5789-70653-0003 AND THOSE WHO WERE TO BE CALLED ON TO GIVE EVIDENCE OCCUPIED CHAIRS TO ONE SIDE OF THE TABLE BEHIND WHICH THE CORONER SAT WHILE THE JURY IN DOUBLE ROW WITH PLASTERED HAIR AND A SPURIOUS EASE OF MANNER FLANKED HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5789-70653-0004 AN UNDISTINGUISHED PUBLIC FILLED THE REST OF THE SPACE AND LISTENED IN AN AWED SILENCE TO THE OPENING SOLEMNITIES THE NEWSPAPER MEN WELL USED TO THESE
5789-70653-0006 PROCEEDED TO DRAW AN ACCOUNT OF THE LAST OCCASION ON WHICH SHE HAD SEEN HER HUSBAND ALIVE MISSUS MANDERSON WAS TAKEN THROUGH HER EVIDENCE BY THE CORONER
5789-70653-0007 WITH THE SYMPATHY WHICH EVERY MAN FELT FOR THAT DARK FIGURE OF GRIEF SHE LIFTED HER THICK VEIL BEFORE BEGINNING TO SPEAK AND THE EXTREME PALENESS AND UNBROKEN COMPOSURE OF THE LADY
5789-70653-0009 BUT HER VOICE WAS LOW AND CLEAR TO THE END HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD COME UP TO HIS BEDROOM ABOUT HIS USUAL HOUR FOR RETIRING ON THE SUNDAY NIGHT
5789-70653-0010 HIS ROOM WAS REALLY A DRESSING ROOM ATTACHED TO HER OWN BEDROOM COMMUNICATING WITH IT BY A DOOR WHICH WAS USUALLY KEPT OPEN DURING THE NIGHT BOTH DRESSING ROOM AND BEDROOM WERE ENTERED BY OTHER DOORS GIVING ON THE PASSAGE
5789-70653-0012 SHE HAD NO CLEAR RECOLLECTION OF WHAT SHE HAD SAID AS SHE HAD BEEN VERY DROWSY AT THE TIME BUT SHE HAD REMEMBERED THAT HE HAD BEEN OUT FOR A MOONLIGHT RUN IN THE CAR
5789-70653-0013 AND WHAT TIME IT WAS SHE HAD ASKED WHAT THE TIME WAS
5789-70653-0015 HE SAID THAT MISTER MARLOWE COULD DO IT QUITE EASILY IF HE HAD NO ACCIDENT HE SAID THAT HE HAD STARTED IN THE CAR AND THEN WALKED BACK HOME A MILE OR SO AND FELT ALL THE BETTER FOR IT DID HE SAY ANY MORE
5789-70653-0016 AND YOU HEARD NOTHING IN THE NIGHT NO I NEVER WOKE UNTIL MY MAID BROUGHT MY TEA IN THE MORNING AT SEVEN O'CLOCK SHE CLOSED THE DOOR LEADING TO MY HUSBAND'S ROOM AS SHE ALWAYS DID
5789-70653-0018 THE WITNESS DROPPED HER HEAD AND SILENTLY WAITED FOR HER DISMISSAL BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE YET MISSUS MANDERSON THE CORONER'S VOICE WAS SYMPATHETIC BUT IT HAD A HINT OF FIRMNESS IN IT NOW
5789-70653-0019 THE QUESTION I AM GOING TO PUT TO YOU MUST IN THESE SAD CIRCUMSTANCES BE A PAINFUL ONE
5789-70653-0021 HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS ME HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ANXIETY AND SORROW HE HAD CHANGED TOWARDS ME HE HAD BECOME VERY RESERVED AND SEEMED MISTRUSTFUL I SAW MUCH LESS OF HIM THAN BEFORE
5789-70653-0022 HE SEEMED TO PREFER TO BE ALONE I CAN GIVE NO EXPLANATION AT ALL OF THE CHANGE I TRIED TO WORK AGAINST IT I DID ALL I COULD WITH JUSTICE TO MY OWN DIGNITY AS I THOUGHT
5789-70653-0024 I ONLY MADE A POINT OF BEING TO HIM EXACTLY AS I HAD ALWAYS BEEN SO FAR AS HE WOULD ALLOW ME I SUPPOSE I SHALL NEVER KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS THE WITNESS WHOSE VOICE HAD TREMBLED IN SPITE OF HER SELF CONTROL
5789-70653-0025 THEN WAS THERE NEVER ANYTHING OF THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY CALL WORDS BETWEEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND MA'AM NEVER
5789-70653-0027 OF ANY OTHER MATTER WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN PREYING UPON HER HUSBAND'S MIND RECENTLY MISSUS MANDERSON KNEW OF NONE WHATEVER THE CORONER INTIMATED THAT HER ORDEAL WAS AT AN END AND THE VEILED LADY MADE HER WAY TO THE DOOR
5789-70653-0028 THE GENERAL ATTENTION WHICH FOLLOWED HER FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS NOW EAGERLY DIRECTED UPON MARTIN WHOM THE CORONER HAD PROCEEDED TO CALL IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT TRENT APPEARED AT THE DOORWAY AND EDGED HIS WAY INTO THE GREAT ROOM
5789-70653-0030 HE STARTED AS HE STOOD ASIDE FROM THE DOOR WITH A SLIGHT BOW TO HEAR MISSUS MANDERSON ADDRESS HIM BY NAME IN A LOW VOICE HE FOLLOWED HER A PACE OR TWO INTO THE HALL I WANTED TO ASK YOU
5789-70653-0031 SHE SAID IN A VOICE NOW WEAK AND ODDLY BROKEN IF YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR ARM A PART OF THE WAY TO THE HOUSE I COULD NOT SEE MY UNCLE NEAR THE DOOR AND I SUDDENLY FELT RATHER FAINT I SHALL BE BETTER IN THE AIR
5789-70653-0033 RUSHED THROUGH HIS BRAIN IN A ROUT BUT THE TOUCH OF HER UNNERVED HAND UPON HIS ARM NEVER FOR AN INSTANT LEFT HIS CONSCIOUSNESS FILLING HIM WITH AN EXALTATION THAT ENRAGED AND BEWILDERED HIM
5789-70653-0034 HE WAS STILL CURSING HIMSELF FURIOUSLY BEHIND THE MASK OF CONVENTIONAL SOLICITUDE THAT HE TURNED TO THE LADY WHEN HE HAD ATTENDED HER TO THE HOUSE AND SEEN HER SINK UPON A COUCH IN THE MORNING ROOM
5789-70653-0036 SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE HAD NOT EXPECTED THOSE LAST QUESTIONS I AM GLAD YOU DID NOT HEAR ME SHE SAID WHEN HE EXPLAINED BUT OF COURSE YOU WILL READ IT ALL IN THE REPORTS
5808-48608-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVENTH NIGHT SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT IBRAHIM SON OF AL MAHDI CONTINUED NOW WHEN THE HOUSEMASTER HEARD MY NAME HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND SAID

5808-48608-0005 BUT I SAW NOT MY MISTRESS AMONG THEM AND HE SAID O MY LORD THERE IS NONE LEFT SAVE MY MOTHER AND SISTER BUT BY ALLAH I MUST NEEDS HAVE THEM ALSO DOWN AND SHOW THEM TO THEE SO I MARVELLED AT HIS COURTESY AND LARGE HEARTEDNESS AND SAID
5808-48608-0006 MAY I BE THY SACRIFICE BEGIN WITH THE SISTER AND HE ANSWERED WITH JOY AND GOODWILL SO SHE CAME DOWN AND HE SHOWED ME HER HAND AND BEHOLD SHE WAS THE OWNER OF THE HAND AND WRIST QUOTH I

5808-48608-0009 BUT I WAS ABASHED AT HIS GENEROSITY AND WAS ASHAMED TO LIE WITH HER IN HIS HOUSE SO I SAID EQUIP HER AND SEND HER TO MY PLACE
5808-48608-0011 THEN AL MAAMUN MARVELLED AT THE MAN'S GENEROSITY AND SAID GIFTED OF ALLAH IS HE NEVER HEARD I OF HIS LIKE AND HE BADE IBRAHIM BIN AL MAHDI BRING HIM TO COURT THAT HE MIGHT SEE HIM HE BROUGHT HIM AND THE CALIPH CONVERSED WITH HIM
5808-48608-0012 AND HIS WIT AND GOOD BREEDING SO PLEASED HIM THAT HE MADE HIM ONE OF HIS CHIEF OFFICERS AND ALLAH IS THE GIVER THE BESTOWER MEN ALSO RELATE THE TALE OF THE WOMAN WHOSE HANDS WERE CUT OFF FOR GIVING ALMS TO THE POOR
5808-48608-0014 WHEREFORE ALL THE PEOPLE ABSTAINED FROM ALMS DEED AND NONE COULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ANY ONE NOW IT CHANCED THAT ONE DAY A BEGGAR ACCOSTED A CERTAIN WOMAN AND INDEED HUNGER WAS SORE UPON HIM AND SAID TO HER

5808-48608-0018 THE KING HEARD OF THIS WHEREUPON HE CALLED HER BEFORE HIM AND CUT OFF HER HANDS AFTER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO HER HOUSE NOW IT CHANCED AFTER A WHILE THAT THE KING SAID TO HIS MOTHER I HAVE A MIND TO TAKE A WIFE
5808-48608-0020 SHE HATH HAD BOTH HER HANDS CUT OFF SAID HE LET ME SEE HER SO SHE BROUGHT HER TO HIM AND HE WAS RAVISHED BY HER AND MARRIED HER AND WENT IN UNTO HER AND BEGAT UPON HER A SON
5808-48608-0021 NOW THIS WAS THE WOMAN WHO HAD GIVEN TWO SCONES AS AN ALMS TO THE ASKER AND WHOSE HANDS HAD BEEN CUT OFF THEREFOR AND WHEN THE KING MARRIED HER HER FELLOW WIVES ENVIED HER AND WROTE TO THE COMMON HUSBAND THAT SHE WAS AN UNCHASTE

5808-54425-0002 IT MAY BE TRUE THAT THE HABITS OF YEARS ARE HARD TO CHANGE BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE FIRST SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN YEARS OF A YOUNG PERSON'S LIFE ELSE KITTY HAMILTON AND JOE COULD NOT SO EASILY HAVE BECOME WHAT THEY WERE
5808-54425-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING WITHIN HIM TO HOLD HIM BACK FROM THE DEPTHS FOR HIS WILL WAS AS FLABBY AS HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS PRIDE WHICH STANDS TO SOME MEN FOR CONSCIENCE HAD NO DEFINITE AIM OR DIRECTION
5808-54425-0005 HATTIE STERLING HAD GIVEN HIM BOTH HIS GREATEST IMPULSE FOR EVIL AND FOR GOOD SHE HAD AT FIRST GIVEN HIM HIS GENTLE PUSH BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HIS COLLAPSE WOULD LOSE HER A FAITHFUL AND USEFUL SLAVE
5808-54425-0007 AND ACTED IN MOST THINGS AS A SOUND SENSIBLE BEING THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WENT DOWN AGAIN AND WENT DOWN BADLY SHE KEPT HER PROMISE AND THREW HIM OVER
5808-54425-0008 THEN HE BECAME A HANGER ON AT THE CLUBS A GENTEEL LOAFER HE USED TO SAY IN HIS SOBER MOMENTS THAT AT LAST HE WAS ONE OF THE BOYS THAT SADNESS HAD SPOKEN OF HE DID NOT WORK

5808-54425-0011 HE WENT FORTH AT ONCE TO CELEBRATE HIS VICTORY HE DID NOT RETURN TO HER FOR THREE DAYS THEN HE WAS BATTERED UNKEMPT AND THICK OF SPEECH SHE LOOKED AT HIM IN SILENT CONTEMPT FOR A WHILE AS HE SAT NURSING HIS ACHING HEAD
5808-54425-0013 HIS HELPLESSNESS INSTEAD OF INSPIRING HER WITH PITY INFLAMED HER WITH AN UNFEELING ANGER THAT BURST FORTH IN A VOLUME OF TAUNTS
5808-54425-0014 NO ONE HAD EVER LOOKED AT YOU UNTIL I PICKED YOU UP AND YOU VE BEEN STRUTTING AROUND EVER SINCE
5808-54425-0016 AND BEGAN TO SING YOU LL HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER BABY NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME HE LOOKED UP AND HIS EYES WERE FULL OF TEARS TEARS BOTH OF GRIEF AND INTOXICATION THERE WAS AN EXPRESSION OF A WHIPPED DOG ON HIS FACE
5808-54425-0017 HE PLEADED STRETCHING OUT HIS HANDS TO HER HER EYES BLAZED BACK AT HIM BUT SHE SANG ON INSOLENTLY TAUNTINGLY THE VERY INANITY OF THE MAN DISGUSTED HER
5808-54425-0019 ALTERNATELY WEEPING ALOUD AND QUIVERING WITH DRUNKEN HICCOUGHING SOBS

5808-54425-0025 SKAGGSY LOOKED AT THEM REGRETFULLY AS HE SIPPED HIS LIQUOR IT MADE HIM THINK OF MAUDIE HE SIGHED AND TURNED AWAY I TELL YOU SADNESS HE SAID IMPULSIVELY DANCING IS THE POETRY OF MOTION
5808-54425-0026 YES REPLIED SADNESS AND DANCING IN RAG TIME IS THE DIALECT POETRY THE REPORTER DID NOT LIKE THIS IT SAVOURED OF FLIPPANCY
5808-54425-0028 SAID SADNESS REALLY IT S A WASTE OF TIME FOR JOE TO SOBER UP HULLO THERE AS THE YOUNG MAN BROUGHT UP AGAINST HIM TAKE A SEAT HE PUT HIM IN A CHAIR AT THE TABLE
5808-54425-0029 OH A HAIR OF THE DOG SOME MEN SHAVE THEIR DOGS CLEAN AND THEN HAVE HYDROPHOBIA HERE JACK THEY DRANK AND THEN AS IF THE WHISKEY HAD DONE HIM GOOD JOE SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR

5808-54425-0040 THERE HE LAY FOR MORE THAN TWO HOURS WHEN HE FINALLY AWOKE HE STARTED UP AS IF SOME DETERMINATION HAD COME TO HIM IN HIS SLEEP A PART OF THE HELPLESSNESS OF HIS INTOXICATION HAD GONE BUT HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO CALL FOR MORE WHISKEY
5808-54425-0041 THIS HE GULPED DOWN AND FOLLOWED WITH ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FOR A WHILE HE STOOD STILL BROODING SILENTLY HIS RED EYES BLINKING AT THE LIGHT THEN HE TURNED ABRUPTLY AND LEFT THE CLUB
5808-54425-0043 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO HER ROOM
5808-54425-0044 HIS VOICE WAS STEADIER NOW BUT GRIM WHAT DO YOU WANT
5808-54425-0046 HE SAID YES AND I M GOING TO DO IT AGAIN
5808-54425-0047 SHE STARTED TO RISE BUT HE TOOK A STEP TOWARDS HER AND SHE PAUSED HE LOOKED AS SHE HAD NEVER SEEN HIM LOOK BEFORE HIS FACE WAS ASHEN AND HIS EYES LIKE FIRE AND BLOOD SHE QUAILED BENEATH THE LOOK
5808-54425-0049 BACK TO THE WALL STILL HIS HANDS TWITCHED

5808-54425-0055 THIS WAS A TERRIBLE TERRIBLE MAN OR A MONSTER
5808-54425-0056 FOR AN INSTANT SHE LOST THEIR STEADY GLARE AND THEN SHE FOUND HER VOICE THE SCREAM WAS CHECKED AS IT BEGAN HIS FINGERS HAD CLOSED OVER HER THROAT JUST WHERE THE GOWN HAD LEFT IT TEMPTINGLY BARE THEY GAVE IT THE CARESS OF DEATH
5808-54425-0058 FINALLY HE FLUNG HER FROM HIM LIKE A RAG AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
5867-48852-0000 BELL HAD DECLARED THAT HER SISTER WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE JOHN EAMES IF HE WOULD GO OVER TO ALLINGTON AND HE HAD REPLIED THAT OF COURSE HE WOULD GO THERE SO MUCH HAVING BEEN AS IT WERE SETTLED
5867-48852-0002 BUT THE SQUIRE PREFERRED WALKING AND IN THIS WAY THEY WERE DISPOSED OF SOON AFTER BREAKFAST JOHN HAD IT IN HIS MIND TO GET BELL TO HIMSELF FOR HALF AN HOUR AND HOLD A CONFERENCE WITH HER BUT IT EITHER HAPPENED THAT LADY JULIA WAS TOO KEEN IN HER DUTIES AS A HOSTESS
5867-48852-0003 OR ELSE AS WAS MORE POSSIBLE BELL AVOIDED THE MEETING NO OPPORTUNITY FOR SUCH AN INTERVIEW OFFERED ITSELF THOUGH HE HUNG ABOUT THE DRAWING ROOM ALL THE MORNING YOU HAD BETTER WAIT FOR LUNCHEON NOW LADY JULIA SAID TO HIM ABOUT TWELVE
5867-48852-0005 HE COULD RIDE BACK TRIUMPHANT AS A FIELD MARSHAL THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE DELIGHTFUL TO HIM BUT IF SHE SHOULD GIVE HIM NO HOPE IF IT SHOULD BE HIS DESTINY TO BE REJECTED UTTERLY ON THAT MORNING THEN THE HORSE WOULD BE TERRIBLY IN THE WAY OF HIS SORROW
5867-48852-0006 RESTING WHEN HE MIGHT CHOOSE TO REST AND RUNNING WHEN IT MIGHT SUIT HIM TO RUN AND SHE IS NOT LIKE OTHER GIRLS HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF SHE WON'T CARE FOR MY BOOTS BEING DIRTY SO AT LAST HE ELECTED TO WALK

5867-48852-0012 AND SHE HAD ANSWERED HIM BY TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED MISTER CROSBIE BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES OF COURSE SHE HAD DONE SO AT THAT TIME BUT NEVERTHELESS HER MANNER OF TELLING HIM HAD SEEMED TO HIM TO BE CRUEL AND HE ALSO HAD BEEN CRUEL
5867-48852-0014 WAS IT NOT SINGULAR THAT ALL THE EVIL THINGS WHICH HE IN HIS MIND HAD MEDITATED FOR THE MAN HAD FALLEN UPON HIM CROSBIE HAD LOST HIS LOVE HE HAD SO PROVED HIMSELF TO BE A VILLAIN THAT HIS NAME MIGHT NOT BE SO MUCH AS MENTIONED
5867-48852-0015 HE HAD BEEN IGNOMINIOUSLY THRASHED BUT WHAT GOOD WOULD ALL THIS BE IF HIS IMAGE WERE STILL DEAR TO LILY'S HEART I TOLD HER THAT I LOVED HER THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF THOUGH I HAD NO RIGHT TO DO SO
5867-48852-0017 HERE HE ENCOUNTERED HOPKINS
5867-48852-0018 MISTER JOHN MAY I MAKE SO BOLD AND HOPKINS HELD OUT A VERY DIRTY HAND WHICH EAMES OF COURSE TOOK UNCONSCIOUS OF THE CAUSE OF THIS NEW AFFECTION I'M JUST GOING TO CALL AT THE SMALL HOUSE AND I THOUGHT I'D COME THIS WAY

5867-48852-0024 EAMES PASSED ON OVER THE LITTLE BRIDGE WHICH SEEMED TO BE IN A STATE OF FAST DECAY UNATTENDED TO BY ANY FRIENDLY CARPENTER NOW THAT THE DAYS OF ITS USE WERE SO NEARLY AT AN END AND ON INTO THE GARDEN LINGERING ON THE SPOT WHERE HE HAD LAST SAID FAREWELL TO LILY
5867-48852-0026 AND WHY SHOULD HE VENTURE TO HOPE THAT SHE WOULD LOVE HIM NOW
5867-48852-0027 HAD HE NOT BEEN AWARE THAT HIS PROMISE TO OTHERS REQUIRED THAT HE SHOULD PERSEVERE HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD DO THIS THING AND HE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS HIS WORD BUT HE HARDLY VENTURED TO HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE SUCCESSFUL
5867-48852-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WILL BE BETTER THAT I SHOULD NO MAMMA NO WHAT GOOD CAN IT DO IT CAN DO NO GOOD I LIKE HIM AS WELL AS I CAN LIKE ANY ONE I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT IT CAN DO NO GOOD LET HIM COME IN HERE AND BE VERY KIND TO HIM
5867-48852-0030 AND I SHALL BE VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM THEN MISSUS DALE WENT ROUND TO THE OTHER ROOM AND ADMITTED HER VISITOR THROUGH THE WINDOW OF THE DRAWING ROOM WE ARE IN TERRIBLE CONFUSION JOHN ARE WE NOT AND SO YOU ARE REALLY GOING TO LIVE IN GUESTWICK
5867-48852-0032 EAMES WAS SO INTENT ON HIS OWN PURPOSE AND SO FULLY OCCUPIED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK BEFORE HIM THAT HE COULD HARDLY RECEIVE MISSUS DALE'S TIDINGS WITH ALL THE INTEREST WHICH THEY DESERVED UNPACK THEM ALL AGAIN HE SAID
5867-48852-0033 THAT WILL BE VERY TROUBLESOME IS LILY WITH YOU MISSUS DALE YES SHE IS IN THE PARLOUR COME AND SEE HER SO HE FOLLOWED MISSUS DALE THROUGH THE HALL AND FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS LOVE
5867-48852-0035 BUT NEITHER KNEW HOW TO THROW ANY TENDERNESS INTO THIS FIRST GREETING SO YOU'RE STAYING AT THE MANOR HOUSE SAID LILY YES I'M STAYING THERE YOUR UNCLE AND BELL CAME YESTERDAY AFTERNOON HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT BELL SAID MISSUS DALE
5867-48852-0036 OH YES MARY TOLD ME I'M SO GLAD OF IT I ALWAYS LIKED DOCTOR CROFTS VERY MUCH I HAVE NOT CONGRATULATED HER BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS A SECRET BUT CROFTS WAS THERE LAST NIGHT AND IF IT IS A SECRET HE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT KEEPING IT
5867-48852-0038 OF COURSE NOTHING IS SETTLED IT WAS SUCH FUN SAID LILY JAMES WHO TOOK AT ANY RATE A YEAR OR TWO TO MAKE HIS PROPOSAL WANTED TO BE MARRIED THE NEXT DAY AFTERWARDS NO LILY NOT QUITE THAT WELL MAMMA IT WAS VERY NEARLY THAT
5867-48852-0039 I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY I SHOULD SO MUCH LIKE FOR A BROTHER I'M VERY GLAD YOU LIKE HIM VERY GLAD I HOPE YOU'LL BE FRIENDS ALWAYS THERE WAS SOME LITTLE TENDERNESS IN THIS AS JOHN ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF I'M SURE WE SHALL IF HE LIKES IT THAT IS IF I EVER HAPPEN TO SEE HIM
5867-48852-0041 BUT THE VERY ALLUSION TO ANY SUCH ROBBERY COVERED JOHN EAMES'S FACE WITH A BLUSH
5867-48852-0042 AND FOR THE MOMENT SILENCED HIM YOU THINK HE WOULD HAVE A BETTER CAREER IN LONDON SAID LILY SPEAKING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HER SUPERIOR PRESENCE OF MIND SHE HAD CERTAINLY SHOWN DEFECTIVE JUDGMENT IN DESIRING HER MOTHER NOT TO LEAVE THEM ALONE
5867-48852-0044 AND SHE FELT MOREOVER THAT JOHN WAS ENTITLED TO AN OPPORTUNITY OF PLEADING HIS OWN CAUSE
5867-48852-0045 BUT NOT THE LESS SHOULD HE HAVE IT OF RIGHT SEEING THAT HE DESIRED IT BUT YET MISSUS DALE DID NOT DARE TO GET UP AND LEAVE THE ROOM LILY HAD ASKED HER NOT TO DO SO AND AT THE PRESENT PERIOD OF THEIR LIVES ALL LILY'S REQUESTS WERE SACRED
5867-48852-0047 TO SAY THAT YOU THINK WE SHALL NOT GO IT WAS ONLY LAST NIGHT THAT YOU SUGGESTED IT THE TRUTH IS JOHN THAT HOPKINS CAME IN AND DISCOURSED WITH THE MOST WONDERFUL ELOQUENCE NOBODY DARED TO OPPOSE HOPKINS HE MADE US ALMOST CRY HE WAS SO PATHETIC
5867-48852-0048 HE HAS JUST BEEN TALKING TO ME TOO SAID JOHN AS I CAME THROUGH THE SQUIRE'S GARDEN AND WHAT HAS HE BEEN SAYING TO YOU SAID MISSUS DALE OH I DON'T KNOW NOT MUCH
5867-48852-0050 HE HAD SWORN TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT LEAVE THE SMALL HOUSE WITHOUT ASKING LILY TO BE HIS WIFE IT SEEMED TO HIM AS THOUGH HE WOULD BE GUILTY OF FALSEHOOD TOWARDS THE EARL IF HE DID SO LORD DE GUEST HAD OPENED HIS HOUSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0051 AND HAD ASKED ALL THE DALES THERE AND HAD OFFERED HIMSELF UP AS A SACRIFICE AT THE CRUEL SHRINE OF A SERIOUS DINNER PARTY TO SAY NOTHING OF THAT EASIER AND LIGHTER SACRIFICE WHICH HE HAD MADE IN A PECUNIARY POINT OF VIEW IN ORDER THAT THIS THING MIGHT BE DONE
5867-48852-0053 SHOULD HE GET UP BOLDLY AND ASK LILY TO PUT ON HER BONNET AND COME OUT INTO THE GARDEN AS THE THOUGHT STRUCK HIM HE ROSE AND GRASPED AT HIS HAT I AM GOING TO WALK BACK TO GUESTWICK SAID HE IT WAS VERY GOOD OF YOU TO COME SO FAR TO SEE US
5867-48852-0054 I WAS ALWAYS FOND OF WALKING HE SAID
5867-48852-0056 I WONDER WHETHER YOU WOULD COME AS FAR AS THAT WITH ME AS THE REQUEST WAS MADE MISSUS DALE LOOKED AT HER DAUGHTER ALMOST BESEECHINGLY DO PRAY DO SAID HE IT IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR WALKING
5867-48852-0057 THE PATH PROPOSED LAY RIGHT ACROSS THE FIELD INTO WHICH LILY HAD TAKEN CROSBIE WHEN SHE MADE HER OFFER TO LET HIM OFF FROM HIS ENGAGEMENT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT SHE SHOULD EVER WALK THERE AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LOVER NO JOHN SHE SAID NOT TO DAY
5867-48852-0059 OH YES AND THEN I SHOULD HAVE TO GO AGAIN WITH YOU BUT JOHN REALLY I DON'T WISH TO WALK TO DAY WHEREUPON JOHN EAMES AGAIN PUT DOWN HIS HAT LILY SAID HE AND THEN HE STOPPED MISSUS DALE WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW
5867-48852-0060 LILY I HAVE COME OVER HERE ON PURPOSE TO SPEAK TO YOU INDEED I HAVE COME DOWN FROM LONDON ONLY THAT I MIGHT SEE YOU HAVE YOU JOHN YES I HAVE YOU KNOW WELL ALL THAT I HAVE GOT TO TELL YOU
5867-48852-0062 ALWAYS NO TO THAT HOW CAN IT BE OTHERWISE YOU WOULD NOT HAVE ME MARRY YOU WHILE I LOVE ANOTHER BUT HE IS GONE HE HAS TAKEN ANOTHER WIFE I CANNOT CHANGE MYSELF BECAUSE HE IS CHANGED
5867-48852-0063 IF YOU ARE KIND TO ME YOU WILL LET THAT BE ENOUGH BUT YOU ARE SO UNKIND TO ME NO NO OH I WOULD WISH TO BE SO KIND TO YOU JOHN HERE TAKE MY HAND IT IS THE HAND OF A FRIEND WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU
5867-48852-0065 I COULD NOT HAVE THAT ONE THING AND I WAS NEARER TO MY HEART'S LONGINGS THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN I CANNOT HAVE THAT ONE THING BUT I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MYSELF TO BE BROKEN HEARTED
5867-48852-0066 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN I AM HE SAID NOT STRONGER BUT MORE CERTAIN MAKE YOURSELF AS SURE AS I AM AND YOU TOO WILL BE STRONG IS IT NOT SO MAMMA
5867-48852-0068 THAT I LOVED HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD BESIDES IT IS STILL THE SAME I STILL LOVE HIM BETTER THAN ALL THE WORLD HOW THEN CAN I GIVE YOU ANY HOPE
5867-48852-0069 BUT IT WILL NOT BE SO FOR EVER LILY FOR EVER WHY SHOULD HE NOT BE MINE AS WELL AS HERS WHEN THAT FOR EVER COMES JOHN IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS TO LOVE
5867-48852-0071 I SHOULD BE DISGRACED IN MY OWN EYES IF I ADMITTED THE LOVE OF ANOTHER MAN AFTER AFTER IT IS TO ME ALMOST AS THOUGH I HAD MARRIED HIM
5867-48852-0072 I AM NOT BLAMING HIM REMEMBER THESE THINGS ARE DIFFERENT WITH A MAN SHE HAD NOT DROPPED HIS HAND AND AS SHE MADE HER LAST SPEECH WAS SITTING IN HER OLD CHAIR WITH HER EYES FIXED UPON THE GROUND
5867-48852-0074 TO HIM IT SEEMED TO BE IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD CONTINUE HIS SUIT AFTER SUCH A DECLARATION TO MISSUS DALE THEY WERE TERRIBLE WORDS SPEAKING OF A PERPETUAL WIDOWHOOD
5867-48852-0075 AND TELLING OF AN AMOUNT OF SUFFERING GREATER EVEN THAN THAT WHICH SHE HAD ANTICIPATED
5867-48852-0077 MISSUS DALE HAD FELT FROM THE FIRST THAT EAMES WAS COMING TOO SOON THAT THE EARL AND THE SQUIRE TOGETHER WERE MAKING AN EFFORT TO CURE THE WOUND TOO QUICKLY AFTER ITS INFLICTION THAT TIME SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO HER GIRL TO RECOVER
5867-48852-0078 BUT NOW THE ATTEMPT HAD BEEN MADE AND WORDS HAD BEEN FORCED FROM LILY'S LIPS THE SPEAKING OF WHICH WOULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN BY HERSELF I KNEW THAT IT WOULD BE SO SAID JOHN AH YES
5867-48852-0080 WHEN WE DO MEET LET US BE GLAD TO SEE EACH OTHER NO OTHER FRIEND SHALL EVER BE DEARER TO ME THAN YOU ARE YOU ARE SO TRUE AND HONEST WHEN YOU MARRY I WILL TELL YOUR WIFE WHAT AN INFINITE BLESSING GOD HAS GIVEN HER
5867-48852-0081 YOU SHALL NEVER DO THAT YES I WILL I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU MEAN BUT YET I WILL GOOD BY MISSUS DALE HE SAID GOOD BY JOHN
5867-48852-0083 HE LOOKED LONGINGLY INTO HER FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD THOUGHT IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE ALSO MIGHT KISS HIM THEN HE PRESSED HER HAND TO HIS LIPS AND WITHOUT SPEAKING ANY FURTHER FAREWELL TOOK UP HIS HAT AND LEFT THE ROOM POOR FELLOW
5867-48852-0084 SAID MISSUS DALE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE LET HIM COME SAID LILY BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
5867-48852-0086 HE MADE HIS WAY OUT BY THE FRONT DOOR AND THROUGH THE CHURCHYARD AND IN THIS WAY ON TO THE FIELD THROUGH WHICH HE HAD ASKED LILY TO WALK WITH HIM
5867-48852-0087 AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH THE TOMBSTONES HE PAUSED AND READ ONE AS THOUGH IT INTERESTED HIM
5867-48852-0089 AND LAUGHED INWARDLY AS HE REMEMBERED THE FIGURE OF RAFFERTY BRINGING IN THE KNIGHT'S SHOES HE HAD GONE SOME HALF MILE UPON HIS WAY BEFORE HE VENTURED TO STAND STILL AND TELL HIMSELF THAT HE HAD FAILED IN THE GREAT OBJECT OF HIS LIFE YES
5867-48852-0090 HE HAD FAILED AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED TO HIMSELF WITH BITTER REPROACHES THAT HE HAD FAILED NOW AND FOR EVER HE TOLD HIMSELF THAT HE HAD OBTRUDED UPON HER IN HER SORROW WITH AN UNMANNERLY LOVE
5867-48852-0092 HE ALMOST HATED THE EARL FOR HAVING BROUGHT HIM TO THIS CONDITION A CONQUERING HERO INDEED HOW SHOULD HE MANAGE TO SNEAK BACK AMONG THEM ALL AT THE MANOR HOUSE CRESTFALLEN AND ABJECT IN HIS MISERY
5867-48852-0093 EVERYBODY KNEW THE ERRAND ON WHICH HE HAD GONE AND EVERYBODY MUST KNOW OF HIS FAILURE HOW COULD HE HAVE BEEN SUCH A FOOL AS TO UNDERTAKE SUCH A TASK UNDER THE EYES OF SO MANY LOOKERS ON
5867-48852-0095 AND HAD SO MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF THAT NOW ALL HOPE AND HAPPINESS WERE OVER FOR HIM HOW COULD HE ESCAPE AT ONCE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BACK TO LONDON HOW COULD HE GET AWAY WITHOUT SAYING A WORD FURTHER TO ANY ONE
5867-48852-0096 HE CROSSED THE ROAD AT THE END OF THE SQUIRE'S PROPERTY WHERE THE PARISH OF ALLINGTON DIVIDES ITSELF FROM THAT OF ABBOT'S GUEST IN WHICH THE EARL'S HOUSE STANDS AND MADE HIS WAY BACK ALONG THE COPSE WHICH SKIRTED THE FIELD IN WHICH THEY HAD ENCOUNTERED THE BULL
5867-48852-0098 AS IT WAS HE DID NOT THINK IT POSSIBLE THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO HIS PLACE IN THE EARL'S HOUSE HOW COULD HE PRETEND TO MAINTAIN HIS ORDINARY DEMEANOUR UNDER THE EYES OF THOSE TWO OLD MEN IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM TO GET HOME TO HIS MOTHER
5867-48852-0099 TO SEND A MESSAGE FROM THENCE TO THE MANOR AND THEN TO ESCAPE BACK TO LONDON SO THINKING BUT WITH NO RESOLUTION MADE HE WENT ON THROUGH THE WOODS
5867-48852-0101 IT WAS NOT ONLY OF HIS LATE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HE WAS THINKING BUT OF HIS WHOLE PAST LIFE HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF HIS HOBBLEDEHOYHOOD
5867-48852-0102 OF THAT BACKWARDNESS ON HIS PART IN ASSUMING MANHOOD WHICH HAD RENDERED HIM INCAPABLE OF MAKING HIMSELF ACCEPTABLE TO LILY BEFORE SHE HAD FALLEN INTO THE CLUTCHES OF CROSBIE
5867-48852-0104 THERE SHOULD BE SUCH PUNISHMENT BECAUSE OF THE INSINCERITY OF THAT MAN WHEN HE HAD THUS STOOD UPON THE BRIDGE FOR SOME QUARTER OF AN HOUR HE TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH DEEP ROUGH GASHES IN THE WOOD CUT OUT LILY'S NAME FROM THE RAIL
5867-48852-0105 HE HAD HARDLY FINISHED AND WAS STILL LOOKING AT THE CHIPS AS THEY WERE BEING CARRIED AWAY BY THE STREAM WHEN A GENTLE STEP CAME CLOSE UP TO HIM AND TURNING ROUND HE SAW THAT LADY JULIA WAS ON THE BRIDGE SHE WAS CLOSE TO HIM
5867-48852-0107 DO YOU MEAN TO CUT IT OUT FROM YOUR HEART NEVER I WOULD IF I COULD BUT I NEVER SHALL KEEP TO IT AS TO A GREAT TREASURE IT WILL BE A JOY TO YOU IN AFTER YEARS AND NOT A SORROW
5867-48852-0108 WILL BE A CONSOLATION WHEN YOU ARE AS OLD AS I AM IT IS SOMETHING TO HAVE HAD A HEART
5867-48852-0110 IF YOU CAN BE CONSTANT IN YOUR LOVE YOU MAY WIN HER YET REMEMBER HOW YOUNG SHE IS AND HOW YOUNG YOU BOTH ARE COME AGAIN IN TWO YEARS TIME AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE WON HER YOU SHALL TELL ME THAT I HAVE BEEN A GOOD OLD WOMAN TO YOU BOTH
5867-48852-0111 I SHALL NEVER WIN HER LADY JULIA AS HE SPOKE THESE LAST WORDS THE TEARS WERE RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
6000-55211-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN A GIRL AND A BIT OF LOWESTOFT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BREAKFAST THE NEXT MORNING BILLY WAS SUMMONED TO THE TELEPHONE OH GOOD MORNING UNCLE WILLIAM SHE CALLED IN ANSWER TO THE MASCULINE VOICE THAT REPLIED TO HER HULLO

6019-3185-0000 THAT SERIES OF TERRIFIC EVENTS BY WHICH OUR QUIET CITY AND UNIVERSITY IN THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF GERMANY WERE CONVULSED DURING THE YEAR EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN HAS IN ITSELF AND CONSIDERED MERELY AS A BLIND MOVEMENT OF HUMAN TIGER PASSION
6019-3185-0002 AND DESERVES THE DEEP ATTENTION OF COMING GENERATIONS IN THEIR STRUGGLE AFTER HUMAN IMPROVEMENT NOT MERELY IN ITS OWN LIMITED FIELD OF INTEREST DIRECTLY AWAKENED BUT IN ALL ANALOGOUS FIELDS OF INTEREST
6019-3185-0003 AS IN FACT ALREADY AND MORE THAN ONCE IN CONNECTION WITH THESE VERY EVENTS THIS LESSON HAS OBTAINED THE EFFECTUAL ATTENTION OF CHRISTIAN KINGS AND PRINCES ASSEMBLED IN CONGRESS
6019-3185-0005 IN A STRENGTH LIKE THAT OF A WEST INDIAN HURRICANE AND WHICH DID SERIOUSLY THREATEN AT ONE TIME TO DEPOPULATE OUR UNIVERSITY THROUGH THE DARK SUSPICIONS WHICH SETTLED UPON ITS MEMBERS AND THE NATURAL REACTION OF GENEROUS INDIGNATION IN REPELLING THEM
6019-3185-0006 BY SACRIFICING WHENEVER CIRCUMSTANCES ALLOWED THEM THEIR HOUSES AND BEAUTIFUL GARDENS IN EXCHANGE FOR DAYS UNCURSED BY PANIC AND NIGHTS UNPOLLUTED BY BLOOD NOTHING I CAN TAKE UPON MYSELF TO ASSERT
6019-3185-0008 THE ASTOUNDED POLICE AFTER AN EXAMINATION THE MOST SEARCHING PURSUED FROM DAY TO DAY
6019-3185-0009 HAD FINALLY PRONOUNCED THAT NO ATTEMPT APPARENTLY HAD BEEN MADE TO BENEFIT BY ANY OF THE SIGNALS PRECONCERTED THAT NO FOOTSTEP APPARENTLY HAD MOVED IN THAT DIRECTION THEN AND AFTER THAT RESULT
6019-3185-0011 AS THEY WOULD HAVE DONE DURING THE ROCKINGS OF AN EARTHQUAKE WAS EVEN AMONG THE BOLDEST LIKE THAT WHICH SOMETIMES TAKES POSSESSION OF THE MIND IN DREAMS WHEN ONE FEELS ONESELF SLEEPING ALONE UTTERLY DIVIDED FROM ALL CALL OR HEARING OF FRIENDS
6019-3185-0012 DOORS OPEN THAT SHOULD BE SHUT OR UNLOCKED THAT SHOULD BE TRIPLY SECURED THE VERY WALLS GONE BARRIERS SWALLOWED UP BY UNKNOWN ABYSSES NOTHING AROUND ONE BUT FRAIL CURTAINS AND A WORLD OF ILLIMITABLE NIGHT
6019-3185-0014 AND IN WHICH THE HEART BEATS IN CONSCIOUS SYMPATHY WITH AN ENTIRE CITY THROUGH ALL ITS REGIONS OF HIGH AND LOW YOUNG AND OLD STRONG AND WEAK SUCH AGENCIES AVAIL TO RAISE AND TRANSFIGURE THE NATURES OF MEN
6019-3185-0015 IN THAT RESPECT THEREFORE I HAD AN ADVANTAGE BEING UPON THE SPOT THROUGH THE WHOLE COURSE OF THE AFFAIR FOR GIVING A FAITHFUL NARRATIVE AS I HAD STILL MORE EMINENTLY FROM THE SORT OF CENTRAL STATION WHICH I OCCUPIED
6019-3185-0017 A NOBLEMAN CONNECTED WITH THE DIPLOMACY OF RUSSIA FROM WHICH I QUOTE AN EXTRACT I WISH IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND TO YOUR ATTENTIONS AND IN TERMS STRONGER THAN I KNOW HOW TO DEVISE
6019-3185-0018 A YOUNG MAN ON WHOSE BEHALF THE CZAR HIMSELF IS PRIVATELY KNOWN TO HAVE EXPRESSED THE VERY STRONGEST INTEREST HE WAS AT THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO AS AN AIDE DE CAMP TO A DUTCH GENERAL OFFICER AND IS DECORATED WITH DISTINCTIONS WON UPON THAT AWFUL DAY
6019-3185-0020 WHICH MAY ACCOUNT FOR HIS SOMEWHAT MOORISH COMPLEXION THOUGH AFTER ALL THAT IS NOT OF A DEEPER TINGE THAN I HAVE SEEN AMONG MANY AN ENGLISHMAN HE IS HIMSELF ONE OF THE NOBLEST LOOKING OF GOD'S CREATURES
6019-3185-0021 MISTER WYNDHAM'S SUCCESSION TO THE VAST FAMILY ESTATES IS INEVITABLE AND PROBABLY NEAR AT HAND MEANTIME HE IS ANXIOUS FOR SOME ASSISTANCE IN HIS STUDIES INTELLECTUALLY
6019-3185-0023 FOR HE ENTERED THE CAVALRY SERVICE OF A GERMAN POWER WHEN A MERE BOY AND SHIFTED ABOUT FROM SERVICE TO SERVICE AS THE HURRICANE OF WAR BLEW FROM THIS POINT OR FROM THAT
6019-3185-0024 AND TEN YEARS HENCE YOU WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE UPON HAVING CONTRIBUTED YOUR PART TO THE FORMATION OF ONE WHOM ALL HERE AT SAINT PETERSBURG NOT SOLDIERS ONLY BUT WE DIPLOMATES LOOK UPON AS CERTAIN TO PROVE A GREAT MAN
6019-3185-0026 THAT ALL WAS CLOSED BEFORE THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WHEN ONCE THAT CONSUMMATION WAS ATTAINED I THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BREATHED NO SYLLABLE OF WHAT WAS STIRRING NOW GAVE LOOSE TO THE INTERESTING TIDINGS AND SUFFERED THEM TO SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THE TOWN
6019-3185-0027 IT WILL BE EASILY IMAGINED THAT SUCH A STORY ALREADY ROMANTIC ENOUGH IN ITS FIRST OUTLINE WOULD LOSE NOTHING IN THE TELLING AN ENGLISHMAN TO BEGIN WITH WHICH NAME OF ITSELF AND AT ALL TIMES IS A PASSPORT INTO GERMAN FAVOR
6019-3185-0029 THEN A SOLDIER COVERED WITH BRILLIANT DISTINCTIONS AND IN THE MOST BRILLIANT ARM OF THE SERVICE YOUNG MOREOVER AND YET A VETERAN BY HIS EXPERIENCE FRESH FROM THE MOST AWFUL BATTLE OF THIS PLANET SINCE THE DAY OF PHARSALIA
6019-3185-0030 RADIANT WITH THE FAVOR OF COURTS AND OF IMPERIAL LADIES
6019-3185-0032 ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MY HOUSE I BECAME SENSIBLE OF A TRUTH WHICH I HAD OBSERVED SOME YEARS BEFORE THE COMMONPLACE MAXIM IS THAT IT IS DANGEROUS TO RAISE EXPECTATIONS TOO HIGH THIS
6019-3185-0033 WHICH IS THUS GENERALLY EXPRESSED AND WITHOUT LIMITATION IS TRUE ONLY CONDITIONALLY IT IS TRUE THEN AND THERE ONLY WHERE THERE IS BUT LITTLE MERIT TO SUSTAIN AND JUSTIFY THE EXPECTATION BUT IN ANY CASE WHERE THE MERIT IS TRANSCENDENT OF ITS KIND
6019-3185-0035 THE WARNING AT ANY RATE PUT ME ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WHATEVER EMINENCE THERE MIGHT BE OF GRANDEUR IN HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND THIS EXISTED IN SUCH EXCESS SO FAR TRANSCENDING ANYTHING I HAD EVER MET WITH IN MY EXPERIENCE
6019-3185-0036 THAT NO EXPECTATION WHICH IT IS IN WORDS TO RAISE COULD HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED THESE THOUGHTS TRAVELED WITH THE RAPIDITY OF LIGHT THROUGH MY BRAIN AS AT ONE GLANCE MY EYE TOOK IN THE SUPREMACY OF BEAUTY AND POWER
6019-3185-0038 UNIVERSALLY RECEIVED WITH FAVOR AND DISTINCTION IN REALITY HIS WEALTH AND IMPORTANCE HIS MILITARY HONORS AND THE DIGNITY OF HIS CHARACTER AS EXPRESSED IN HIS MANNERS AND DEPORTMENT
6019-3185-0039 WERE TOO EMINENT TO ALLOW OF HIS BEING TREATED WITH LESS THAN THE HIGHEST ATTENTION IN ANY SOCIETY WHATEVER BUT THE EFFECT OF THESE VARIOUS ADVANTAGES ENFORCED AND RECOMMENDED AS THEY WERE BY A PERSONAL BEAUTY SO RARE
6019-3185-0041 HAD COMMUNICATED TO HIS MANNERS A MORE THAN MILITARY FRANKNESS BUT THE PROFOUND MELANCHOLY WHICH POSSESSED HIM FROM WHATEVER CAUSE IT AROSE NECESSARILY CHILLED THE NATIVE FREEDOM OF HIS DEMEANOR
6019-3185-0042 UNLESS WHEN IT WAS REVIVED BY STRENGTH OF FRIENDSHIP OR OF LOVE THE EFFECT WAS AWKWARD AND EMBARRASSING TO ALL PARTIES EVERY VOICE PAUSED OR FALTERED WHEN HE ENTERED A ROOM DEAD SILENCE ENSUED
6019-3185-0044 EITHER AS ACTORS OR SPECTATORS CERTAINLY THIS RESULT WAS NOT A PURE EFFECT OF MANLY BEAUTY HOWEVER HEROIC AND IN WHATEVER EXCESS IT AROSE IN PART FROM THE MANY AND EXTRAORDINARY ENDOWMENTS WHICH HAD CENTERED IN HIS PERSON
6019-3185-0045 WERE THERE THEN NO EXCEPTIONS TO THIS CONDITION OF AWESTRUCK ADMIRATION YES
6019-3185-0047 AND DO NOT KNOW WHETHER MARGARET MANIFESTED THAT TREPIDATION AND EMBARRASSMENT WHICH DISTRESSED SO MANY OF HER YOUTHFUL CO RIVALS BUT IF SHE DID IT MUST HAVE FLED BEFORE THE FIRST GLANCE OF THE YOUNG MAN'S EYE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET PAST ALL MISUNDERSTANDING
6019-3185-0048 ON THE PART OF MARGARET IT SEEMED AS IF A NEW WORLD HAD DAWNED UPON HER THAT SHE HAD NOT SO MUCH AS SUSPECTED AMONG THE CAPACITIES OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE LIKE SOME BIRD SHE SEEMED WITH POWERS UNEXERCISED FOR SOARING AND FLYING
6019-3185-0050 HERE THEN AND THUS FAR NOTHING BUT HAPPINESS HAD RESULTED FROM THE NEW ARRANGEMENT BUT IF THIS HAD BEEN LITTLE ANTICIPATED BY MANY FAR LESS HAD I FOR MY PART ANTICIPATED THE UNHAPPY REVOLUTION WHICH WAS WROUGHT IN THE WHOLE NATURE
6019-3185-0051 WHO HAD DIED IN GIVING BIRTH TO THIS THIRD CHILD THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD LONG SURVIVED HER ANXIOUS THAT HIS SON SHOULD GO THROUGH A REGULAR COURSE OF MATHEMATICAL INSTRUCTION NOW BECOMING ANNUALLY MORE IMPORTANT IN ALL THE ARTILLERY SERVICES THROUGHOUT EUROPE
6019-3185-0053 FOR THE FOUR LAST HE HAD LIVED WITH ME AS THE SOLE PUPIL WHOM I HAD OR MEANT TO HAVE HAD NOT THE BRILLIANT PROPOSALS OF THE YOUNG RUSSIAN GUARDSMAN PERSUADED ME TO BREAK MY RESOLUTION FERDINAND VON HARRELSTEIN HAD GOOD TALENTS
6019-3185-0054 NOT DAZZLING BUT RESPECTABLE AND SO AMIABLE WERE HIS TEMPER AND MANNERS THAT I HAD INTRODUCED HIM EVERYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE HE WAS A FAVORITE AND EVERYWHERE INDEED EXCEPT EXACTLY THERE WHERE ONLY IN THIS WORLD HE CARED FOR FAVOR
6019-3185-0056 THAT SHE IT WAS WHO MUST BE HIS GOOD OR HIS EVIL GENIUS AT FIRST AND PERHAPS TO THE LAST I PITIED HIM EXCEEDINGLY BUT MY PITY SOON CEASED TO BE MINGLED WITH RESPECT
6019-3185-0057 AND THE SOLE RESOURCE FOR HIM AS I SAID OFTEN WAS TO QUIT THE CITY TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE PURSUITS OF ENTERPRISE OF AMBITION OR OF SCIENCE BUT HE HEARD ME AS A SOMNAMBULIST MIGHT HAVE HEARD ME DREAMING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
6019-3185-0059 FOR MORE THAN I SAW ENOUGH TO FEAR SOME FEARFUL CATASTROPHE LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION SAID HIS CONFESSOR TO HIM IN MY HEARING FOR THOUGH PRUSSIANS THE VON HARRELSTEINS WERE ROMAN CATHOLICS LEAD US NOT INTO TEMPTATION
6019-3185-0060 REVEREND FATHER DO NOT YOU WITH THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING ME FROM TEMPTATION BE YOURSELF THE INSTRUMENT FOR TEMPTING ME INTO A REBELLION AGAINST THE CHURCH DO NOT YOU WEAVE SNARES ABOUT MY STEPS SNARES THERE ARE ALREADY AND BUT TOO MANY
6019-3185-0062 WHOSE CONVENT STOOD NEAR THE CITY GATES THERE GOES ONE READY EQUALLY FOR DOING OR SUFFERING AND OF WHOM WE SHALL SOON HEAR THAT HE IS INVOLVED IN SOME GREAT CATASTROPHE IT MAY BE OF DEEP CALAMITY
6019-3185-0063 FOR THE COSTLINESS OF THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS UNDERSTOOD TO BE AN EXPRESSION OF OFFICIAL PRIDE DONE IN HONOR OF THE CITY NOT AS AN EFFORT OF PERSONAL DISPLAY IT FOLLOWED FROM THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THESE HALF YEARLY DANCES ORIGINATED
6019-3185-0065 UPON THE EVENING AT WHICH I AM NOW ARRIVED THE TWENTY SECOND OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTEEN THE WHOLE CITY IN ITS WEALTHIER CLASSES WAS ASSEMBLED BENEATH THE ROOF OF A TRADESMAN WHO HAD THE HEART OF A PRINCE
6019-3185-0066 IN EVERY POINT OUR ENTERTAINMENT WAS SUPERB AND I REMARKED THAT THE MUSIC WAS THE FINEST I HAD HEARD FOR YEARS OUR HOST WAS IN JOYOUS SPIRITS PROUD TO SURVEY THE SPLENDID COMPANY HE HAD GATHERED UNDER HIS ROOF
6019-3185-0068 AND THAT ALSO I THINK WAS THE MOST JOYOUS OF ALL THE BANQUETS I EVER WITNESSED THE ACCOMPLISHED GUARDSMAN OUTSHONE HIMSELF IN BRILLIANCY EVEN HIS MELANCHOLY RELAXED IN FACT HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE
6019-3185-0069 HANGING UPON HIS WORDS MORE LUSTROUS AND BEWITCHING THAN EVER I HAD BEHELD HER THERE SHE HAD BEEN PLACED BY THE HOST AND EVERYBODY KNEW WHY THAT IS ONE OF THE LUXURIES ATTACHED TO LOVE ALL MEN CEDE THEIR PLACES WITH PLEASURE
6019-3185-0071 THE MUSIC AGAIN BEGAN TO POUR ITS VOLUPTUOUS TIDES THROUGH THE BOUNDING PULSES OF THE YOUTHFUL COMPANY AGAIN THE FLYING FEET OF THE DANCERS BEGAN TO RESPOND TO THE MEASURES
6019-3185-0072 AGAIN THE MOUNTING SPIRIT OF DELIGHT BEGAN TO FILL THE SAILS OF THE HURRYING NIGHT WITH STEADY INSPIRATION ALL WENT HAPPILY ALREADY HAD ONE DANCE FINISHED SOME WERE PACING UP AND DOWN LEANING ON THE ARMS OF THEIR PARTNERS
6019-3185-0074 BUT THERE EVERY MOMENT LESS AND LESS COULD BE SEEN FOR THE GATHERING CROWD MORE AND MORE INTERCEPTED THE VIEW SO MUCH THE MORE WAS THE EAR AT LEISURE FOR THE SHRIEKS REDOUBLED UPON SHRIEKS MISS LIEBENHEIM HAD MOVED DOWNWARD TO THE CROWD
6019-3185-0075 AND HAD LIVED WITH HER UNCLE A TRADESMAN NOT TEN DOORS FROM MARGARET'S OWN RESIDENCE PARTLY ON THE TERMS OF A KINSWOMAN PARTLY AS A SERVANT ON TRIAL AT THIS MOMENT SHE WAS EXHAUSTED WITH EXCITEMENT AND THE NATURE OF THE SHOCK SHE HAD SUSTAINED
6019-3185-0077 MOST OF WHOM WERE STILL UNACQUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ALARMING INTERRUPTION A FEW HOWEVER WHO HAD HEARD HER FIRST AGITATED WORDS
6019-3185-0078 NOW RUSHED TUMULTUOUSLY OUT OF THE BALLROOM TO SATISFY THEMSELVES ON THE SPOT THE DISTANCE WAS NOT GREAT AND WITHIN FIVE MINUTES SEVERAL PERSONS RETURNED HASTILY AND CRIED OUT TO THE CROWD OF LADIES THAT ALL WAS TRUE WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL HAD SAID
6019-3185-0080 BUT BOTH INFIRM BEYOND THEIR YEARS TWO MAIDEN SISTERS OF MISTER WEISHAUPT FROM FORTY TO FORTY SIX YEARS OF AGE AND AN ELDERLY FEMALE DOMESTIC
6019-3185-0081 AN INCIDENT HAPPENED DURING THE RECITAL OF THESE HORRORS AND OF THE DETAILS WHICH FOLLOWED THAT FURNISHED MATTER FOR CONVERSATION EVEN IN THESE HOURS WHEN SO THRILLING AN INTEREST HAD POSSESSION OF ALL MINDS MANY LADIES FAINTED AMONG THEM
6019-3185-0083 THAT SIGHT WAS MORE THAN COULD BE BORNE BY ONE WHO STOOD A LITTLE BEHIND THE GROUP HE RUSHED FORWARD WITH EYES GLARING LIKE A TIGER'S AND LEVELED A BLOW AT MAXIMILIAN IT WAS POOR MANIACAL VON HARRELSTEIN
6019-3185-0084 MANY PEOPLE STEPPED FORWARD AND CHECKED HIS ARM UPLIFTED FOR A REPETITION OF THIS OUTRAGE ONE OR TWO HAD SOME INFLUENCE WITH HIM AND LED HIM AWAY FROM THE SPOT
6019-3185-0086 AND YET THE PRUDES COMPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A LOOK OF LOVE EXCHANGED BETWEEN HERSELF AND MAXIMILIAN THAT OUGHT NOT TO HAVE ESCAPED HER IN SUCH A SITUATION IF THEY MEANT BY SUCH A SITUATION ONE SO PUBLIC
6019-3185-0087 THAT IT WAS A SITUATION OF EXCESSIVE AGITATION BUT IF THEY ALLUDED TO THE HORRORS OF THE MOMENT NO SITUATION MORE NATURALLY OPENS THE HEART TO AFFECTION AND CONFIDING LOVE THAN THE RECOIL FROM SCENES OF EXQUISITE TERROR
6019-3185-0089 GOLD REPEATERS MASSY PLATE GOLD SNUFF BOXES UNTOUCHED THAT ARGUMENT CERTAINLY WEIGHED MUCH IN HIS FAVOR AND YET AGAIN IT WAS TURNED AGAINST HIM FOR A MAGISTRATE ASKED HIM HOW HE HAPPENED TO KNOW ALREADY THAT NOTHING HAD BEEN TOUCHED
6019-3185-0090 TRUE IT WAS AND A FACT WHICH HAD PUZZLED NO LESS THAN IT HAD AWED THE MAGISTRATES THAT UPON THEIR EXAMINATION OF THE PREMISES MANY RICH ARTICLES OF BIJOUTERIE JEWELRY AND PERSONAL ORNAMENTS HAD BEEN FOUND LYING UNDERANGED
6019-3185-0092 FOR HITHER HAD ONE OF THE LADIES FLED HITHER HAD ONE OF THE MURDERERS PURSUED SHE HAD CLASPED THE GOLDEN PILLARS WHICH SUPPORTED THE ALTAR HAD TURNED PERHAPS HER DYING LOOKS UPON THE CRUCIFIX
6019-3185-0093 FOR THERE WITH ONE ARM STILL WREATHED ABOUT THE ALTAR FOOT THOUGH IN HER AGONY SHE HAD TURNED ROUND UPON HER FACE DID THE ELDER SISTER LIE WHEN THE MAGISTRATES FIRST BROKE OPEN THE STREET DOOR AND UPON THE BEAUTIFUL PARQUET
6019-3185-0095 THOSE PARTS OF THE TRACES WHICH LAY UPON THE BLACK TESSELLAE BEING LESS DISTINCT IN THE OUTLINE THAN THE OTHERS UPON THE WHITE OR COLORED MOST UNQUESTIONABLY SO FAR AS THIS WENT IT FURNISHED A NEGATIVE CIRCUMSTANCE IN FAVOR OF THE NEGRO
6019-3185-0096 FOR THE FOOTSTEPS WERE VERY DIFFERENT IN OUTLINE FROM HIS AND SMALLER FOR AARON WAS A MAN OF COLOSSAL BUILD
6019-3185-0098 HE CONTENDED THAT HE HAD HIMSELF BEEN AMONG THE CROWD THAT PUSHED INTO THE HOUSE ALONG WITH THE MAGISTRATES THAT FROM HIS PREVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ROOMS AND THEIR ORDINARY CONDITION
6019-3185-0099 THAT IN FACT HE HAD SEEN ENOUGH FOR HIS ARGUMENT BEFORE HE AND THE REST OF THE MOB HAD BEEN EJECTED BY THE MAGISTRATES BUT FINALLY THAT INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL THIS HE HAD HEARD BOTH THE OFFICERS AS THEY CONDUCTED HIM
6019-3185-0101 ATTACKED THEM SINGLY IN FLIGHT FOR IN THIS FIRST CASE ALL BUT ONE OF THE MURDERED PERSONS APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR THE STREET DOOR AND IN ALL THIS THERE WAS NO SUBJECT FOR WONDER EXCEPT THE ORIGINAL ONE AS TO THE MOTIVE
6019-3185-0102 IN SAD LEISURELY OR IN TERRIFIC GROUPS SEEMED TO ARGUE A LETHARGY LIKE THAT OF APOPLEXY IN THE VICTIMS ONE AND ALL THE VERY MIDNIGHT OF MYSTERIOUS AWE FELL UPON ALL MINDS
6019-3185-0104 ALL COMBINATION WITH OTHER TOWNS BEING UNAVAILING FROM THEIR GREAT DISTANCE OUR SITUATION WAS NO ORDINARY ONE HAD THERE BEEN SOME MYSTERIOUS ROBBERS AMONG US THE CHANCES OF A VISIT DIVIDED AMONG SO MANY
6019-3185-0105 WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SMALL TO DISTRESS THE MOST TIMID WHILE TO YOUNG AND HIGH SPIRITED PEOPLE WITH COURAGE TO SPARE FOR ORDINARY TRIALS
6019-3185-0107 HAD THESE VERY MURDERERS ADDED TO THEIR FUNCTIONS THOSE OF ROBBERY THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME LESS TERRIFIC
6019-3185-0108 FROM THE ROLL OF THOSE WHO WERE LIABLE TO A VISIT WHILE SUCH AS KNEW THEMSELVES LIABLE WOULD HAVE HAD WARNING OF THEIR DANGER IN THE FACT OF BEING RICH AND WOULD FROM THE VERY RICHES WHICH CONSTITUTED THAT DANGER HAVE DERIVED THE MEANS OF REPELLING IT BUT AS THINGS WERE
6019-3185-0110 TRUE THEY WERE BIGOTED IN A DEGREE WHICH INDICATED FEEBLENESS OF INTELLECT BUT THAT WOUNDED NO MAN IN PARTICULAR WHILE TO MANY IT RECOMMENDED THEM TRUE THEIR CHARITY WAS NARROW AND EXCLUSIVE BUT TO THOSE OF THEIR OWN RELIGIOUS BODY IT EXPANDED MUNIFICENTLY
6019-3185-0111 AND BEING RICH BEYOND THEIR WANTS OR ANY MEANS OF EMPLOYING WEALTH WHICH THEIR GLOOMY ASCETICISM ALLOWED THEY HAD THE POWER OF DOING A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AMONG THE INDIGENT PAPISTS OF THE SUBURBS
6064-56165-0001 HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED TO CALL IT GOSSIP IF THERE WAS ANY ONE THING IN THE WORLD HE HATED SO HE SAID IT WAS GIRLS TALK THIS JABBERING ABOUT NOTHING FOR HIS PART HE WOULDN'T WASTE HIS TIME THAT WAY
6064-56165-0002 YET WHEN HE HAD AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE AND GIRLS GENERALLY APPRECIATED WHAT PHILIP SAID HE WOULD OFTEN SPEND AS MUCH AS HALF AN HOUR TALKING ABOUT THE FELLOWS
6064-56165-0004 I WASN'T SORRY FOR THE NEW YORK SET IS GETTING JUST UNBEARABLE I WOULDN'T SO MUCH MIND FIGHTING STANLEY HOOPER MYSELF ABOUT NEW YORK AND BOSTON I GUESS I'D SHOW HIM THAT NEW YORK ISN'T THE WHOLE WORLD
6064-56165-0005 I SHOULD SAY NOT EXCLAIMED NORA BUT BELLE WHO HAD SOME NEW YORK COUSINS WAS SILENT BRENDA HOWEVER NOTICING BELLE'S EXPRESSION AND NOT FEELING DISPOSED TO SIDE COMPLETELY WITH NORA SAID
6064-56165-0007 WELL YOU'D BETTER TALK BRENDA BARLOW BROKE IN NORA AGAIN JUST SEE THE WAY YOU TREAT JULIA IF SHE'D BEEN BORN IN BOSTON I DON'T TREAT HER INTERRUPTED BRENDA
6064-56165-0008 NO THAT'S JUST IT YOU DON'T TREAT HER DECENTLY
6064-56165-0010 PHILIP LOOKED OVER HIS SHOULDER IN THE GLASS THERE WAS NOTHING THE MATTER WITH HIS OWN SHAPELY NOSE AND I DOUBT THAT HE WOULD HAVE RUN ANY SUCH RISK AS EDITH SUGGESTED PERHAPS THIS WAS THE REASON WHY PHILIP WAS NOT A FIGHTER
6064-56165-0011 THERE WAS ONE GOOD THING ABOUT THE LITTLE DISPUTES IN WHICH BRENDA AND BELLE INDULGED THEY VERY SELDOM LASTED LONG IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE GIRLS WERE ASHAMED OF HAVING SHOWN TEMPER BEFORE PHILIP
6064-56165-0013 HOW FUNNY YOU ARE EDITH SAID BELLE YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING HASN'T ANYONE TOLD YOU HOW THE OTHER FELLOWS MADE HIM RUN BLINDFOLDED IN HIS SHIRT SLEEVES DOWN BEACON STREET NO REALLY
6064-56165-0014 AND EVERYBODY LOOKING AT HIM OH SAID ONE GIRL AND AH SAID ANOTHER AND HOW SILLY THEY ALL CRIED TOGETHER IF GIRLS AMUSED THEMSELVES LIKE THAT WHAT FUN YOU'D MAKE OF US SAID THE PRACTICAL NORA
6064-56165-0016 SAID THE PRACTICAL EDITH I DON'T BELIEVE YOU KNOW A BIT MORE ABOUT WILL HARDON'S BRAVERY THAN YOU DID BEFORE WE KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT HIS MANNERS WHAT WHY WHEN HE SAW WHERE HE WAS HE DIDN'T RUN AWAY OR FLUNK OUT
6064-56165-0017 HE ONLY LOOKED A LITTLE SHEEPISH THE OTHER FELLOWS SAID
6064-56165-0019 OR STAND ON THEIR HEADS IN FRONT OF A PULPIT FOR THE SAKE OF GETTING INTO THE DICKY I TELL YOU WE MAKE SOME OF THEM SUFFER
6064-56165-0020 ALTHOUGH HE HAD BELONGED TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS ORGANIZATION A VERY SHORT TIME WELL I THINK YOU'RE PERFECTLY HORRID CRIED BRENDA I MEAN THE DICKY I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE WAY YOU MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER BRANDING THEM WITH HOT CIGARS AND MAKING THEM RUN BAREFOOT WINTER NIGHTS AND
6064-56165-0022 OH THEY HATE TO SEE THESE GIRLS GOING ABOUT WITH BOOKS AND TRYING TO GET INTO HARVARD YES TRYING TO BREAK DOWN THE WALLS SAID NORA SARCASTICALLY
6064-56165-0023 OH SEE HERE IT WOULD JUST SPOIL EVERYTHING TO HAVE WOMEN IN THE CLASSES WITH US ARE YOU AFRAID THEY'D GET AHEAD OF YOU ASKED EDITH GENTLY NOW LOOK HERE EDITH
6064-56165-0025 WELL I WISH MYSELF THAT OUR ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR HADN'T SUCH A FONDNESS FOR READING THEMES TO US THAT THE GIRLS HAVE WRITTEN HE MAKES OUT THAT THEY ARE BETTER THAN OURS BUT I CAN'T SAY THAT I SEE IT MYSELF WHO GETS THE BEST MARKS
6064-56165-0026 DOES JULIA WEAR GLASSES OR LOOK GREEN I BEG YOUR PARDON BRENDA NO SHE DOESN'T SAID NORA SHORTLY SHE'S ABOUT THE NICEST GIRL I KNOW OH SHE IS LOVELY ADDED EDITH
6064-56165-0028 SHE'S INVITED TO MY COOKING PARTY NEXT WEEK SAID NORA YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE ACCEPTED TOO SO YOU'LL SEE HER OH YES BY THE WAY SAID PHILIP WHAT EVENING IS IT FRIDAY OF COURSE REPLIED NORA
6064-56165-0029 SO WE CAN SIT UP LATE WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY WELL YOU'LL SEE ME SURE SAID PHILIP BUT SEE HERE IT'S FIVE O'CLOCK NOW AND I HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT DOWN TOWN
6064-56165-0031 THOUGH ONLY ABOUT FOUR YEARS THEIR SENIOR HE SEEMED MUCH OLDER THAN BRENDA AND HER FRIENDS YEARS BEFORE THEY HAD ALL BEEN PLAYMATES TOGETHER BUT HIS TWO YEARS IN COLLEGE HAD TAKEN HIM AWAY FROM THEM
6064-56165-0032 AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THAT HE CONDESCENDED TO SPEND AS LONG A TIME IN THEIR PRESENCE AS HAD BEEN THE CASE THIS AFTERNOON DO YOU THINK THAT PHILIP LOOKS VERY WELL EDITH
6064-56165-0034 HOW CAN YOU CRITICISE EDITH'S BROTHER DON'T LET HER DO IT EDITH IT DOESN'T TROUBLE ME ANSWERED THE PLACID EDITH I KNOW ALL ABOUT PHILIP AND HE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME THAT'S RIGHT SAID NORA
6064-56165-0035 HE SAYS THERE ARE TWO OR THREE FELLOWS JUST SPONGING OFF OF PHILIP ALL THE TIME AND PHILIP IS TOO GOOD NATURED TO SAY ANYTHING I WONDER HOW HE'LL LIKE JULIA SAID EDITH
6064-56168-0000 FOR A WEEK BEFORE THANKSGIVING THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AMONG THE SCHOOLGIRLS ON ACCOUNT OF THE APPROACHING FOOTBALL GAME THE FOUR WERE AS EXCITED AS THE OTHERS ALTHOUGH NOT SO MANY OF THEIR OWN PARTICULAR FRIENDS WERE IN THE HARVARD TEAM
6064-56168-0001 IT WAS TO BE A GAME WITH PRINCETON ONE OF THE GREAT UNIVERSITY MATCHES AND FOR SPECIAL REASONS THERE WAS THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN THE MATCH THOSE GIRLS WHO HAD BROTHERS IN COLLEGE OR EVEN COUSINS OR FRIENDS HELD THEMSELVES WITH MORE DIGNITY THAN ANY OF THE OTHERS
6064-56168-0003 THE GIRLS WERE MAKING UP LITTLE GROUPS TO GO TO THE GAME WITH YOUTHS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE AS ESCORTS UNDER THE CHAPERONAGE OF OLDER PEOPLE A FEW WHO HAD RECEIVED NO INVITATION WERE ESPECIALLY MISERABLE AND TOOK NO TROUBLE TO DISGUISE THEIR FEELINGS
6064-56168-0004 WHO HAD NOT BEEN INVITED ELSEWHERE TO GO IN SOME OTHER PARTY NOW EDITH WAS OF A GENERALLY GENEROUS DISPOSITION AND NOT INCLINED TO LIMIT HER FAVORS OF WHATEVER NATURE TO ANY PARTICULAR SET OF GIRLS
6064-56168-0006 FOR OF COURSE IN THE MINDS OF THE OTHERS THERE COULD BE BUT ONE GAME
6064-56168-0007 WHY WHO IS IT CRIED BRENDA AND WHO IS IT ECHOED BELLE I KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T GUESS OH DON'T BE SILLY NORA IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH WHILE TO GUESS ABOUT SOMETHING YOU'LL KNOW ALL ABOUT SO SOON
6064-56168-0009 IT THAT CRIED NORA DIDN'T I SAY THAT IT WAS A PERSON A GIRL IF I MUST BE MORE DEFINITE RUTH ROBERTS IF I MUST TELL JUST WHO IT IS OH CRIED BELLE AND AH ECHOED BRENDA
6064-56168-0010 YOU NEED NOT LOOK SO SURPRISED REJOINED NORA AND IF YOU TAKE MY ADVICE YOU WILL NOT SAY ANYTHING TO EDITH SHE OUGHT TO HAVE HER OWN WAY IN ARRANGING HER OWN PARTY AND YOU KNOW WHEN SHE MAKES UP HER MIND IT IS OF NO USE TO TALK TO HER ABOUT IT
6064-56168-0012 RUTH ROBERTS IS AS PLEASANT A GIRL AS THERE IS IN SCHOOL AND YET SHE WOULD HAVE A TERRIBLY LONELY TIME IF IT WERE NOT FOR EDITH AND JULIA NOBODY ELSE EVER THINKS OF SPEAKING TO HER WELL WHY SHOULD WE
6064-56168-0013 YES THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO NORA SMILED PLEASANTLY AND HER EYES LOOKED BRIGHTER THAN EVER UNDER THE RIM OF HER BROWN FELT HAT WITH ITS TRIMMINGS OF LIGHTER BROWN NORA'S TEMPER WAS NOT EASILY RUFFLED
6064-56168-0015 BUT I DON'T SEE TURNING RATHER SNAPPISHLY TOWARDS BRENDA WHY THE REST OF US HAVE GOT TO TAKE UP RUTH ROBERTS JUST BECAUSE YOUR COUSIN JULIA IS SO DEVOTED TO HER NOW THIS WAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH EVEN FOR BRENDA
6064-56168-0016 AND ANYWAY I'M THANKFUL TO HAVE JULIA TAKE A FANCY TO ANYBODY IT LEAVES US A GREAT DEAL FREER TO DO AS WE LIKE I SHOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT YOURSELF OH WELL SAID NORA LAUGHING THE WHOLE THING IS NOT WORTH QUARRELING ABOUT
6064-56168-0018 I AM GOING TO CARRY AN ORANGE SCARF AND PERHAPS AN ORANGE FLAG WHAT FOR WHY I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING EXCLAIMED NORA NOR I CRIED BRENDA AT A HARVARD GAME
6064-56168-0019 I SHOULD CALL IT VERY IMPOLITE IF THERE WERE NO ORANGE FLAGS SHOWN AT THE GAME WELL YOU HAVE THE MOST RIDICULOUS IDEAS HASN'T SHE BRENDA BRENDA NODDED ASSENT AND NORA CONTINUED
6064-56168-0021 OR TO EDITH EITHER THEY ARE BOTH PERFECTLY DEVOTED TO HARVARD AND THEY EXPECT THEIR PARTY TO GIVE GREAT ENCOURAGEMENT TO THE HARVARD TEAM WHY BELLE I CANNOT IMAGINE YOUR DOING ANYTHING ELSE I'M NOT A CHILD RESPONDED BELLE VERY CROSSLY
6064-56168-0022 WALKING AWAY FROM NORA AND BRENDA I DO NOT NEED TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO WHAT NORA OR BRENDA MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED I CANNOT SAY FOR HARDLY HAD BELLE DISAPPEARED WITHIN THE HOUSE WHEN EDITH HERSELF APPEARED WITH JULIA AND RUTH
6064-56168-0024 THAT THEY WERE VERY SELFISH IN LEAVING THEIR SCHOOLMATE SO ENTIRELY TO HERSELF IT WAS NOT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT LIKE HER THEY WERE MERELY SO VERY MUCH WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN AFFAIRS THAT THEY HARDLY NOTICED THAT SHE WAS OFTEN LEFT TO HERSELF
6064-56168-0025 RUTH LIVED IN THE SUBURBS AND AS BELLE HAD SAID OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL THE OTHER GIRLS SELDOM SAW HER AT RECESS EACH LITTLE GROUP HAD SO MANY PERSONAL THINGS TO TALK ABOUT THAT AN OUTSIDER WOULD HAVE BEEN DECIDEDLY IN THE WAY
6064-56168-0027 WHEN THE TONGUES OF HALF A DOZEN GIRLS ARE VIGOROUSLY DISCUSSING PEOPLE AND EVENTS OF WHICH THE LISTENER HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST KNOWLEDGE RUTH HERSELF WAS VERY INDEPENDENT
6064-56168-0028 SHE HAD ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF STUDYING DURING RECESS SINCE AFTER SCHOOL SHE SPENT MORE TIME THAN MOST GIRLS OF HER AGE IN OUTDOOR SPORTS IT DID HER NO GREAT HARM TO PASS THE HALF HOUR OF RECESS IN THIS WAY RUTH AS WELL AS JULIA
6064-56168-0030 NO ONE WHO SAW THE HEARTY WAY IN WHICH NORA AND BRENDA GREETED RUTH AS SHE CAME UP WITH EDITH AND JULIA COULD FOR A MOMENT HAVE IMAGINED THAT SHE HAD BEEN UNDER DISCUSSION THE MERCURIAL BRENDA FOR THE MOMENT
6064-56168-0031 WAS SO ANNOYED BY BELLE'S PROPOSED CHAMPIONSHIP OF PRINCETON THAT SHE WAS UNEXPECTEDLY CORDIAL TO RUTH AND ALMOST TO HER OWN SURPRISE FOUND HERSELF URGING RUTH TO COME TO TOWN EARLY ON THE SATURDAY OF THE GAME TO TAKE LUNCHEON WITH HER AND JULIA
6064-56168-0033 OH DEAR I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SATURDAY I KNOW IT REPLIED BRENDA IT'S LESS THAN A WEEK TOO BUT IT SEEMS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME
6064-300880-0000 FIVE TIMES MISTER THOMAS HARMON VAINLY RANG THE BELL OF THE REMSEN MANSION WHILE ENGAGED UPON THE SIXTH VARIATION HE BECAME AWARE OF A FACE IN THE WINDOW SCRUTINIZING HIM ALL RIGHT CALLED THE FACE
6064-300880-0002 NOT YET CARE TO TRY WHAT DOES THE THING LOOK LIKE CAST YOUR EYES TOWARD THE AVENUE AND YOU'LL SEE ONE

6078-54007-0009 SO SAYS SAINT NICHOLAS THAT'S A PIECE OF WORK WELL DONE THEN HE TOSSED THE HAZEL NUT UNDER THE ROOTS OF AN OAK TREE NEAR BY AND WENT HIS WAY AND THAT IS HOW THIS STORY BEGINS WELL

6078-54007-0014 ALL BUILT OF WHITE MARBLE WITH A FOUNTAIN IN FRONT AND PEACOCKS STRUTTING ABOUT ON THE LAWN WELL THE FIDDLER SMOOTHED DOWN HIS HAIR AND BRUSHED HIS CLOTHES A BIT AND OFF HE WENT TO SEE WHAT WAS TO BE SEEN AT THE GRAND HOUSE AT THE END OF THE GARDEN
6078-54007-0015 HE ENTERED THE DOOR AND NOBODY SAID NO TO HIM THEN HE PASSED THROUGH ONE ROOM AFTER ANOTHER AND EACH WAS FINER THAN THE ONE HE LEFT BEHIND MANY SERVANTS STOOD AROUND BUT THEY ONLY BOWED AND NEVER ASKED WHENCE HE CAME
6078-54007-0017 DO NOT SAY THAT SIT DOWN TO THE TABLE AND EAT AND WHEN I HAVE TOLD YOU ALL YOU WILL SAY IT WAS NOT ILL LUCK BUT GOOD LUCK THAT BROUGHT YOU THE FIDDLER HAD HIS OWN MIND ABOUT THAT BUT ALL THE SAME DOWN HE SAT AT THE TABLE
6078-54007-0018 AND FELL TO WITH KNIFE AND FORK AT THE GOOD THINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD NOT HAD A BITE TO EAT FOR A WEEK OF SUNDAYS I AM THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD SAYS THE LITTLE OLD MAN AFTER A WHILE I AM GLAD TO HEAR IT SAYS THE FIDDLER YOU MAY WELL BE SAID THE OLD MAN
6078-54007-0020 AND SO YOU SHALL LIVE WITH ME AS LONG AS I LIVE AND AFTER I AM GONE EVERYTHING THAT I HAVE SHALL BE YOURS THE FIDDLER DID NOTHING BUT STARE WITH OPEN EYES AND MOUTH AS THOUGH HE WOULD NEVER SHUT EITHER AGAIN
6078-54007-0021 EVERYTHING THE FIDDLER WANTED CAME TO HIS HAND HE LIVED HIGH AND SLEPT SOFT AND WARM AND NEVER KNEW WHAT IT WAS TO WANT EITHER MORE OR LESS OR GREAT OR SMALL IN ALL OF THOSE THREE OR FOUR DAYS HE DID NOTHING BUT ENJOY HIMSELF
6078-54007-0023 BUT THE FIDDLER WAS A MASTER HAND AT FINDING OUT ANYTHING HE WANTED TO KNOW HE DINNED AND DRUMMED AND WORRIED UNTIL FLESH AND BLOOD COULD STAND IT NO LONGER SO AT LAST THE OLD MAN SAID THAT HE WOULD SHOW HIM THE TREASURE HOUSE WHERE ALL HIS WEALTH CAME FROM
6078-54007-0024 AND AT THAT THE FIDDLER WAS TICKLED BEYOND MEASURE
6078-54007-0026 DOWN BELOW IT WAS AS LIGHT AS DAY FOR IN THE CENTRE OF THE ROOM HUNG A GREAT LAMP THAT SHONE WITH A BRIGHT LIGHT
6078-54007-0027 YOU MUST NEVER OPEN THAT DOOR YONDER AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM SHOULD YOU DO SO ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU OH NO THE FIDDLER WOULD NEVER THINK OF DOING SUCH A THING AS OPENING THE DOOR
6078-54007-0029 PERHAPS I CAN SEE WHAT IS THERE WITHOUT OPENING THE DOOR SO DOWN HE TOOK THE KEY AND OFF HE MARCHED TO THE GARDEN HE OPENED THE TRAP DOOR AND WENT DOWN THE STEEP STEPS TO THE ROOM BELOW THERE WAS THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE ROOM
6078-54007-0030 BUT WHEN HE CAME TO LOOK THERE WAS NO KEY HOLE TO IT
6078-54007-0032 SO HE ENTERED THE PASSAGEWAY AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM HE WENT ON AND ON AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT KEPT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER AND BY AND BY POP OUT HE CAME AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGE SURE ENOUGH
6078-54007-0033 THERE HE STOOD ON THE SEA SHORE WITH THE WAVES BEATING AND DASHING ON THE ROCKS HE STOOD LOOKING AND WONDERING TO FIND HIMSELF IN SUCH A PLACE WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMETHING CAME WITH A WHIZ AND A RUSH AND CAUGHT HIM BY THE BELT AND AWAY HE FLEW LIKE A BULLET
6078-54007-0035 UNTIL THEY CAME TO ANOTHER GARDEN AND THERE ILL LUCK LET THE FIDDLER DROP SWASH DOWN HE FELL INTO THE TOP OF AN APPLE TREE AND THERE HE HUNG IN THE BRANCHES IT WAS THE GARDEN OF A ROYAL CASTLE
6078-54007-0036 AND ALL HAD BEEN WEEPING AND WOE THOUGH THEY WERE BEGINNING NOW TO PICK UP THEIR SMILES AGAIN AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY HAD DIED AND NO ONE WAS LEFT BEHIND HIM BUT THE QUEEN
6078-54007-0038 YOU FELL FROM HEAVEN FOR I SAW IT WITH MY EYES AND HEARD IT WITH MY EARS I SEE HOW IT IS NOW YOU WERE SENT HITHER FROM HEAVEN TO BE MY HUSBAND AND MY HUSBAND YOU SHALL BE YOU SHALL BE KING OF THIS COUNTRY HALF AND HALF WITH ME AS QUEEN
6078-54007-0039 AND SHALL SIT ON A THRONE BESIDE ME YOU CAN GUESS WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS MUSIC TO THE FIDDLER'S EARS SO THE PRINCES WERE SENT PACKING AND THE FIDDLER WAS MARRIED TO THE QUEEN AND REIGNED IN THAT COUNTRY WELL THREE OR FOUR DAYS PASSED
6078-54007-0041 YOU MUST NOT ASK OR WISH TO KNOW SHOULD YOU OPEN THAT DOOR ILL LUCK WILL BE SURE TO OVERTAKE YOU POOH SAID THE FIDDLER I DON'T CARE TO KNOW ANYHOW AND OFF THEY WENT HAND IN HAND YES
6078-54007-0042 THAT WAS A VERY FINE THING TO SAY BUT BEFORE AN HOUR HAD GONE BY THE FIDDLER'S HEAD BEGAN TO HUM AND BUZZ LIKE A BEEHIVE I DON'T BELIEVE SAID HE THERE WOULD BE A GRAIN OF HARM IN MY PEEPING INSIDE THAT DOOR ALL THE SAME
6078-54007-0044 AND THE SPARK OF LIGHT AT THE FAR END AS THOUGH THE SUN WERE SHINING HE COCKED HIS HEAD TO ONE SIDE AND LISTENED YES SAID HE I THINK I HEAR THE WATER RUSHING BUT I AM NOT SURE I WILL JUST GO A LITTLE FURTHER IN
6078-54007-0045 AND LISTEN AND SO HE ENTERED AND CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HIM WELL HE WENT ON AND ON UNTIL POP THERE HE WAS OUT AT THE FARTHER END AND BEFORE HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT HE HAD STEPPED OUT UPON THE SEA SHORE
6078-54007-0047 UNTIL THE FIDDLER'S HEAD GREW SO DIZZY THAT HE HAD TO SHUT HIS EYES SUDDENLY ILL LUCK LET HIM DROP AND DOWN HE FELL THUMP BUMP ON THE HARD GROUND THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND SAT UP
6078-54007-0048 OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE BEEN A KING IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR ILL LUCK AND THAT IS THE WAY WE ALL OF US TALK DOCTOR FAUSTUS HAD SAT ALL THE WHILE NEITHER DRINKING ALE NOR SMOKING TOBACCO BUT WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND IN SILENCE
6078-54007-0050 AND A RHETORICIAN AN ASTRONOMER AN ASTROLOGER AND A PHILOSOPHER AS WELL TIS A LONG LIST OF EXCELLENCY SAID OLD BIDPAI
6078-54007-0051 NAY SAID SAINT GEORGE EVERYTHING MUST HAVE A NAME IT HATH NO NAME SAID DOCTOR FAUSTUS BUT I SHALL GIVE IT A NAME AND IT SHALL BE
6078-54013-0001 DAY AFTER DAY TIME IN AND TIME OUT FOR SEVEN YEARS IN THOSE YEARS THE SERVANT WAS WELL ENOUGH CONTENTED BUT NO ONE LIKES TO ABIDE IN THE SAME PLACE FOREVER AND SO ONE DAY HE TOOK IT INTO HIS HEAD THAT HE WOULD LIKE TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
6078-54013-0002 TO SEE WHAT KIND OF A FORTUNE A MAN MIGHT MAKE THERE FOR HIMSELF
6078-54013-0004 SEE HERE IS A LITTLE PEBBLE AND ITS LIKE IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN THE SEVEN KINGDOMS FOR WHOEVER HOLDS IT IN HIS MOUTH CAN HEAR WHILE HE DOES SO
6078-54013-0005 PAYING HIS WAY WITH THE FEW PENNIES HE HAD SAVED IN HIS SEVEN YEARS OF SERVICE BUT FOR ALL OF HIS TRAVELLING NOTHING OF GOOD HAPPENED TO HIM UNTIL ONE MORNING HE CAME TO A LONELY PLACE WHERE THERE STOOD A GALLOWS AND THERE HE SAT HIM DOWN TO REST
6078-54013-0007 THERE THEY BEGAN TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE SERVANT POPPED THE PEBBLE INTO HIS MOUTH TO HEAR WHAT THEY MIGHT SAY YONDER IS A TRAVELLER IN THE WORLD SAID THE FIRST RAVEN YES SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0008 WHY THUS SAID THE SECOND
6078-54013-0010 THAT MAN WOULD LEAD HIM TO THE GARDEN
6078-54013-0011 THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS SAID THE FIRST RAVEN AND OF WHAT USE WOULD THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS BE TO HIM
6078-54013-0013 AND AWAY HE WENT AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD CARRY HIM ON AND ON HE TRAVELLED UNTIL HE CAME TO THE CROSS ROADS AND THE STONE CROSS OF WHICH THE RAVEN SPOKE AND THERE SURE ENOUGH SAT THE TRAVELLER
6078-54013-0014 THERE IS ONE CONDITION YOU MUST FULFIL MANY STRANGE THINGS WILL HAPPEN UPON OUR JOURNEY BETWEEN HERE AND THERE
6078-54013-0016 AND THE TIME IS NONE TOO LONG TO GET THERE SO ALL THE REST OF THAT DAY THEY JOURNEYED ONWARD TOGETHER UNTIL TOWARDS EVENING THEY CAME TO A TOWN WITH HIGH TOWERS AND STEEP ROOFS AND TALL SPIRES
6078-54013-0017 THE SERVANT'S COMPANION ENTERED THE GATE AS THOUGH HE KNEW THE PLACE RIGHT WELL AND LED THE WAY UP ONE STREET AND DOWN ANOTHER UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A NOBLE HOUSE THAT STOOD A LITTLE APART BY ITSELF WITH GARDENS OF FLOWERS AND FRUIT TREES ALL AROUND IT
6078-54013-0019 TO LISTEN TO THE MUSIC WELL HE PLAYED AND PLAYED UNTIL BY AND BY THE DOOR OPENED AND OUT CAME A SERVING MAN HO PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0020 WHERE DOZENS OF SERVANTS WERE SERVING A FINE FEAST BUT ONLY ONE MAN SAT AT TABLE A YOUNG MAN WITH A FACE SO SORROWFUL THAT IT MADE A BODY'S HEART ACHE TO LOOK UPON HIM CAN YOU PLAY GOOD MUSIC PIPER SAID HE
6078-54013-0022 THEREUPON HE DREW OUT HIS PIPES AND BEGAN TO PLAY AND IT WAS SUCH A TUNE AS NO MAN EVER LISTENED TO BEFORE HE PLAYED AND HE PLAYED AND AFTER A WHILE ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THOSE WHO LISTENED TO HIM BEGAN TO GET DROWSY FIRST THEY WINKED
6078-54013-0023 THEN THEY SHUT THEIR EYES AND THEN THEY NODDED UNTIL ALL WERE AS DUMB AS LOGS AND AS SOUND ASLEEP AS THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER WAKEN AGAIN ONLY THE SERVANT AND THE PIPER STAYED AWAKE FOR THE MUSIC DID NOT MAKE THEM DROWSY AS IT DID THE REST
6078-54013-0025 AND STEPPING UP TO THE YOUNG MAN TOOK FROM OFF HIS FINGER A SPLENDID RUBY RING AS RED AS BLOOD AND AS BRIGHT AS FIRE AND POPPED THE SAME INTO HIS POCKET AND ALL THE WHILE THE SERVING MAN STOOD GAPING LIKE A FISH
6078-54013-0026 TO SEE WHAT HIS COMRADE WAS ABOUT
6078-54013-0028 BUT THE NEXT DAY THEY JOGGED ON TOGETHER AGAIN UNTIL BY AND BY THEY CAME TO A GREAT FOREST THERE THEY WANDERED UP AND DOWN TILL NIGHT CAME UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM STILL STUMBLING ONWARD THROUGH THE DARKNESS
6078-54013-0029 HE SEEMED TO DOUBT NOTHING NOR FEAR NOTHING BUT TRUDGED STRAIGHT AHEAD UNTIL BY AND BY THEY SAW A LIGHT TWINKLING FAR AWAY AND WHEN THEY CAME TO IT THEY FOUND A GLOOMY STONE HOUSE AS UGLY AS EYES EVER LOOKED UPON
6078-54013-0031 NO MATTER FOR THAT SAID THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WE CAN GO NO FARTHER TO NIGHT SO YOU MUST LET US IN AND HIDE US AS BEST YOU MAY AND IN HE WENT AS HE SAID WITH THE SERVANT AT HIS HEELS
6078-54013-0032 TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF AT WHAT HE HAD HEARD THE OLD WOMAN GAVE THEM SOME BREAD AND MEAT TO EAT AND THEN HID THEM AWAY IN THE GREAT EMPTY MEAL CHEST IN THE CORNER AND THERE THEY LAY AS STILL AS MICE
6078-54013-0034 HOW THEY HAD CRUELLY ROBBED AND MURDERED POOR PEOPLE
6078-54013-0035 HE DREW FROM HIS POCKET THE RUBY RING WHICH HE HAD STOLEN FROM THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN'S FINGER
6078-54013-0037 THE TWO TRAVELLERS CAME TO A LITTLE HUT NEAT ENOUGH
6078-54013-0038 AND THERE THE COMRADE KNOCKED UPON THE DOOR AND ASKED FOR LODGING
6078-54013-0040 BUT THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE DAWNING OF THE DAY THE TRAVELLING COMPANION WAS STIRRING AGAIN
6078-54013-0041 FOR I HAVE A BIT OF WORK TO DO BEFORE I LEAVE THIS PLACE AND STRANGE WORK IT WAS
6078-54013-0043 ALL WAS A RED BLAZE BEHIND THEM
6078-54013-0044 ON THEY JOGGED AND BY THE TIME EVENING WAS AT HAND THEY HAD COME TO A NEAT COTTAGE
6078-54013-0046 BUT IN THE MORNING HE TOLD THE WIDOW WHITHER THEY WERE GOING AND ASKED IF SHE AND HER SON KNEW THE WAY TO THE GARDEN WHERE GREW THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS YES SAID SHE THAT WE DO FOR THE GARDEN IS NOT A DAY'S JOURNEY FROM HERE
6078-54013-0047 AND MY SON HIMSELF SHALL GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU THE WAY THAT IS GOOD SAID THE SERVANT'S COMRADE AND IF HE WILL DO SO I WILL PAY HIM WELL FOR HIS TROUBLE SO THE YOUNG MAN PUT ON HIS HAT AND TOOK UP HIS STICK
6078-54013-0049 ALL HE COULD DO WAS TO STAND AND LOOK
6078-54013-0050 TORRENT WITHOUT A BRIDGE FOR A BODY TO CROSS OVER YONDER IS WHAT YOU SEEK SAID THE YOUNG MAN POINTING WITH HIS FINGER AND THERE YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THE FRUIT OF HAPPINESS
6078-54013-0052 THAT IS YOUR REWARD FOR YOUR SERVICE
6078-54013-0053 HE FOUND HIS TONGUE AT LAST AND ALL THAT HE HAD BOTTLED UP
6078-54013-0055 THEREUPON AS HE ENDED SPEAKING HE STRUCK HIS STAFF UPON THE GROUND INSTANTLY THE EARTH TREMBLED AND THE SKY DARKENED OVERHEAD UNTIL IT GREW AS BLACK AS NIGHT
6078-54013-0056 THE GARDEN AND THE TORRENT AND ALL WERE GONE AND NOTHING WAS LEFT BUT A NAKED PLAIN COVERED OVER WITH THE BONES OF THOSE WHO HAD COME THAT WAY BEFORE SEEKING THE FRUIT WHICH THE TRAVELLING SERVANT HAD SOUGHT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE THE SERVANT FOUND HIS WAY BACK INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
6078-54013-0058 AND SHE WAS DRESSED IN CLOTHES FIT FOR A QUEEN TO WEAR SHINING WITH GOLD AND SILVER AND PRECIOUS STONES THE SERVANT STOOD AND STARED LIKE ONE BEREFT OF WITS
6078-54013-0059 AN ANGEL CAME AND SHOWED THE WAY TO MY SON
6078-54013-0061 THE HOUSE THAT HE HAD SEEN THE ANGEL SET FIRE TO THERE HE BEHELD MASONS AND CARPENTERS HARD AT WORK HACKING AND HEWING AND BUILDING A FINE NEW HOUSE AND THERE HE SAW THE POOR MAN HIMSELF STANDING BY GIVING THEM ORDERS HOW IS THIS SAID THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0062 FOR MANY A LONG DAY AND NEVER KNEW THAT A GREAT TREASURE OF SILVER AND GOLD WAS HIDDEN BENEATH IT UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO THERE CAME AN ANGEL
6078-54013-0064 HE GAVE IT TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE BAND AND AFTER HE HAD GONE THE ROBBERS FOUGHT FOR IT WITH ONE ANOTHER UNTIL THEY WERE ALL KILLED SO NOW THE WORLD IS RID OF THEM AND TRAVELLERS CAN COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE BACK JOGGED THE TRAVELLING SERVANT
6078-54013-0065 AND THE NEXT DAY CAME TO THE TOWN AND TO THE HOUSE OF THE SORROWFUL YOUNG MAN THERE LO AND BEHOLD INSTEAD OF BEING DARK AND SILENT AS IT WAS BEFORE ALL WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT AND NOISY WITH THE SOUND OF REJOICING AND MERRIMENT
6078-54013-0067 INTO THE HOUSE THEY HAULED THE POOR SERVANT AND INTO THE SAME ROOM WHERE HE HAD BEEN BEFORE AND THERE SAT THE YOUNG MAN AT A GRAND FEAST WITH HIS WIFE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS AROUND HIM BUT WHEN THE YOUNG MAN SAW THE POOR SERVING MAN HE CAME TO HIM
6078-54013-0068 AND TOOK HIM BY THE HAND AND SET HIM BESIDE HIMSELF AT THE TABLE
6078-54013-0070 MY WIFE AND ALL MY FRIENDS FELL OUT WITH ME AND WE QUARRELLED SO THAT THEY ALL LEFT ME BUT THOUGH I KNEW IT NOT AT THAT TIME YOUR COMRADE WAS AN ANGEL AND TOOK THE RING AWAY WITH HIM AND NOW I AM AS HAPPY AS I WAS SORROWFUL BEFORE
6078-54013-0071 RAP TAP TAP HE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR AND THE WISE MAN WHO HAD BEEN HIS MASTER OPENED TO HIM
6078-54013-0073 AND THEN JOGGED ALL THE WAY BACK HOME AGAIN TO COOK CABBAGE AND ONIONS AND POT HERBS AND TO MAKE BROTH FOR WISER MEN THAN HIMSELF TO SUP
6078-54013-0074 NO OFFENCE SAID THE BLACKSMITH I MEANT NOT TO SPEAK ILL OF YOUR STORY COME COME SIR WILL YOU NOT TAKE A POT OF ALE WITH ME WHY SAID SAINT GEORGE SOMEWHAT MOLLIFIED
6078-54013-0076 SUCH AS I KILLED IN MY ADVENTURES YOU WOT OF OLD ALI BABA HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS HANDS FOLDED AND HIS EYES CLOSED NOW HE OPENED THEM AND LOOKED AT THE LITTLE TAILOR
6078-54013-0077 WHO WAS AS BIG AS A GIANT AND SIX TIMES AS POWERFUL AND BESIDES THAT HE ADDED
6078-54013-0079 COME FRIEND LET US HAVE IT STOP A BIT SAID FORTUNATUS WHAT IS THIS STORY MOSTLY ABOUT IT IS SAID ALI BABA ABOUT TWO MEN BETWIXT WHOM THERE WAS
6081-41997-0000 HENCE THE DRIVER'S HOPE OF FINDING THEM IN THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE
6081-41997-0002 A MAXIM INTENDED TO ASSURE HIS AFTER FAME AND WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS ALWAYS SUSPECT THAT WHICH SEEMS PROBABLE AND BEGIN BY BELIEVING WHAT APPEARS INCREDIBLE
6081-41997-0003 AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE WAS WELL UNDER WAY THE YOUNG DETECTIVE PROCEEDED TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF INTO THE DRIVER'S GOOD GRACES BEING ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THIS WORTHY WAS ABLE TO IMPART
6081-41997-0005 WAS SPEEDILY REACHED THEN IT WAS THAT LECOQ RESUMED HIS INQUIRIES WELL MY GOOD FELLOW HE BEGAN YOU HAVE TOLD ME THE PRINCIPAL FACTS NOW I SHOULD LIKE THE DETAILS
6081-41997-0006 HOW DID THESE TWO WOMEN ATTRACT YOUR ATTENTION
6081-41997-0008 HALF FOR MYSELF BUT I WAS SO WET AND MISERABLE AND THE HORSE SEEMED SO DONE UP THAT I DECIDED TO GO HOME I DID GRUMBLE I CAN TELL YOU WELL I HAD JUST PASSED THE CORNER OF THE RUE PICARD
6081-41997-0009 WHEN I SAW TWO WOMEN STANDING UNDER A LAMP SOME LITTLE DISTANCE OFF I DID NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM FOR WHEN A MAN IS AS OLD AS I AM WOMEN GO ON SAID LECOQ WHO COULD NOT RESTRAIN HIS IMPATIENCE
6081-41997-0011 A LOUIS FOR YOURSELF I HESITATED FOR A MOMENT WHEN THE WOMAN ADDED AND TEN FRANCS FOR THE FARE I THEN DREW UP LECOQ WAS BOILING OVER WITH IMPATIENCE BUT HE FELT THAT THE WISEST COURSE WAS NOT TO INTERRUPT THE DRIVER WITH QUESTIONS
6081-41997-0012 BUT TO LISTEN TO ALL HE HAD TO SAY AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE CONTINUED THE COACHMAN I WASN'T INCLINED TO TRUST TWO SUCH SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS ALONE AT THAT HOUR AND IN THAT PART OF THE CITY
6081-41997-0014 SAYING ABOVE ALL MAKE HASTE YOUR RECITAL COULD NOT BE MORE MINUTE EXCLAIMED LECOQ APPROVINGLY NOW HOW ABOUT THESE TWO WOMEN
6081-41997-0015 WHICH RAN AFTER YOU THE GIRL WHO WAS NEATLY DRESSED THE ONE WHO THE DRIVER SUDDENLY PAUSED SOME VIVID REMEMBRANCE PASSED THROUGH HIS BRAIN AND ABRUPTLY JERKING THE RAINS

6081-41997-0018 SHE WITH SHABBY DRESS AND SHOES AS BIG AS A GOUTY MAN'S YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN HER SHAKE THE PRIM LOOKING GIRL AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A PLUM TREE YOU LITTLE FOOL SAID SHE DO YOU WANT TO RUIN US
6081-41997-0020 SHE APPEARED TO BE SO ILL THAT I SAID TO MYSELF HERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN WHO HAS DRUNK MORE THAN IS GOOD FOR HER THESE FACTS CONFIRMED EVEN IF THEY CORRECTED
6081-41997-0021 LECOQ'S FIRST SUPPOSITIONS AS HE HAD SUSPECTED THE SOCIAL POSITION OF THE TWO WOMEN WAS NOT THE SAME HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN HOWEVER
6081-41997-0023 IN REALITY SOCIAL PREEMINENCE BELONGED TO THE WOMAN WHO HAD LEFT THE LARGE BROAD FOOTPRINTS BEHIND HER AND NOT MERELY WAS SHE OF A SUPERIOR RANK BUT SHE HAD ALSO SHOWN SUPERIOR ENERGY
6081-41997-0024 CONTRARY TO LECOQ'S ORIGINAL IDEA IT NOW SEEMED EVIDENT THAT SHE WAS THE MISTRESS AND HER COMPANION THE SERVANT IS THAT ALL MY GOOD FELLOW HE ASKED THE DRIVER
6081-41997-0026 WHETHER SHE WAS A BLONDE OR BRUNETTE SO MANY QUESTIONS AT A TIME CONFUSED THE DRIVER STOP A MINUTE HE REPLIED IN MY OPINION SHE WASN'T PRETTY AND I DON'T BELIEVE SHE WAS YOUNG
6081-41997-0027 BUT SHE CERTAINLY WAS A BLONDE AND WITH PLENTY OF HAIR TOO WAS SHE TALL OR SHORT STOUT OR SLENDER BETWEEN THE TWO THIS WAS VERY VAGUE AND THE OTHER
6081-41997-0029 THE VEHICLE WAS NOW ROLLING ALONG THE RUE DE BOURGOGNE HALF WAY DOWN THE STREET THE DRIVER PULLED UP AND TURNING TO LECOQ EXCLAIMED HERE WE ARE THAT'S THE HOUSE THE HUSSIES WENT INTO
6081-41997-0030 TO DRAW OFF THE SILK HANDKERCHIEF THAT SERVED HIM AS A MUFFLER TO FOLD IT AND SLIP IT INTO HIS POCKET TO SPRING TO THE GROUND AND ENTER THE HOUSE INDICATED WAS ONLY THE WORK OF AN INSTANT FOR THE YOUNG DETECTIVE
6081-41997-0032 TO WHICH ONE REALLY I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW IN A MOMENT THE WORTHY DAME IMAGINED THAT THIS POLITE YOUNG MAN WAS MAKING FUN OF HER YOU SCAMP SHE BEGAN
6081-41997-0033 EXCUSE ME INTERRUPTED LECOQ ALLOW ME TO FINISH I MUST TELL YOU THAT AT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY I WAS QUIETLY RETURNING HOME WHEN TWO LADIES WHO WERE SEEMINGLY IN A GREAT HURRY
6081-41997-0035 FOR FEAR OF DISTURBING YOU YESTERDAY I WAS SO BUSY I COULDN'T COME HOWEVER HERE I AM AT LAST AND HERE'S THE HANDKERCHIEF SO SAYING
6081-41997-0036 I SLIPPED ON MY DRESS AND WENT OUT INTO THE HALL WHERE I SAW TWO WOMEN HASTENING TOWARD THE DOOR BEFORE I COULD REACH THEM THEY SLAMMED THE DOOR IN MY FACE I OPENED IT AGAIN AS QUICKLY AS I COULD AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
6081-41997-0038 HOWEVER HE BOWED CIVILLY TO THE CONCIERGE WHOM HE MIGHT POSSIBLY HAVE NEED OF AT ANOTHER TIME AND THEN WENT BACK TO THE CAB AS I HAD SUPPOSED THEY DO NOT LIVE HERE HE REMARKED TO THE DRIVER
6081-41998-0000 WHEN A MYSTERIOUS CRIME HAS BEEN PERPETRATED OR A GREAT CATASTROPHE HAS HAPPENED AND THE IDENTITY OF THE VICTIMS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED A GREAT DAY INVARIABLY FOLLOWS AT THE MORGUE
6081-41998-0002 EXCHANGING JESTS WELL CALCULATED TO MAKE AN ORDINARY MORTAL'S FLESH CREEP AS A RULE THEY ARE FAR LESS INTERESTED IN THE CORPSES LAID OUT FOR PUBLIC VIEW ON THE MARBLE SLABS IN THE PRINCIPAL HALL
6081-41998-0003 AS THE VEHICLE CONVEYING LECOQ REACHED THE QUAY
6081-41998-0005 I PREFER TO ALIGHT HERE RATHER THAN IN FRONT OF THE MORGUE HE SAID SPRINGING TO THE GROUND THEN PRODUCING FIRST HIS WATCH AND NEXT HIS PURSE HE ADDED
6081-41998-0006 WE HAVE BEEN AN HOUR AND FORTY MINUTES MY GOOD FELLOW CONSEQUENTLY I OWE YOU NOTHING AT ALL REPLIED THE DRIVER DECIDEDLY BUT NO NOT A SOU
6081-41998-0008 TILL YOU HAVE CAUGHT THE JADES AS LECOQ'S PURSE WAS LOW HE DID NOT INSIST YOU WILL AT LEAST TAKE MY NAME AND ADDRESS CONTINUED THE DRIVER CERTAINLY
6081-41998-0009 THE MAGISTRATE WILL WANT YOUR EVIDENCE AND A SUMMONS WILL BE SENT YOU ALL RIGHT THEN ADDRESS IT TO PAPILLON EUGENE DRIVER
6081-41998-0011 YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD ANOTHER APPOINTMENT AND THAT YOU WERE ALREADY LATE YES I OUGHT TO BE AT THE PALAIS DE JUSTICE BUT IT IS ONLY A FEW STEPS FROM HERE NO MATTER
6081-41998-0012 I WILL WAIT FOR YOU AT THE CORNER OF THE BRIDGE IT'S USELESS TO SAY NO I'VE MADE UP MY MIND AND I'M A BRETON YOU KNOW
6081-41998-0014 MOST OF WHOM COULD SEE NOTHING AT ALL WERE PACKED AS CLOSELY AS SARDINES
6081-41998-0015 THAT LECOQ MANAGED TO EFFECT AN ENTRANCE AS USUAL HE FOUND AMONG THE MOB A LARGE NUMBER OF GIRLS AND WOMEN FOR STRANGE TO SAY
6081-41998-0017 WHICH CRIME ACCIDENT AND SUICIDE BRING TO THIS HORRIBLE PLACE A FEW
6081-41998-0018 MAY COME NO FURTHER THAN THE DOOR BUT THE OTHERS ENTER AND AFTER A LONG STARE RETURN AND RECOUNT THEIR IMPRESSIONS TO THEIR LESS COURAGEOUS COMPANIONS IF THERE SHOULD BE NO CORPSE EXHIBITED
6081-41998-0020 FOR THE MYSTERIOUS MURDERER WHOSE IDENTITY LECOQ WAS TRYING TO ESTABLISH HAD FURNISHED THREE VICTIMS FOR THEIR DELECTATION
6081-41998-0021 AND YET A DAMP CHILL CAME FROM BEYOND THE IRON RAILINGS WHILE FROM THE CROWD ITSELF ROSE AN INFECTIOUS VAPOR IMPREGNATED WITH THE STENCH OF THE CHLORIDE OF LIME USED AS A DISINFECTANT
6081-41998-0023 ONLY TO FALL IN FINE SPRAY UPON THE MARBLE THROUGH THE SMALL ARCHED WINDOWS A GRAY LIGHT STOLE IN ON THE EXPOSED BODIES BRINGING EACH MUSCLE INTO BOLD RELIEF
6081-41998-0024 REVEALING THE GHASTLY TINTS OF THE LIFELESS FLESH AND IMPARTING A SINISTER ASPECT TO THE TATTERED CLOTHING HUNG AROUND THE ROOM TO AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE CORPSES THIS CLOTHING AFTER A CERTAIN TIME IS SOLD
6081-41998-0026 WHOM HE COULD NOT PERCEIVE HAD GEVROL INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY FAILED TO FULFIL HIS PROMISE
6081-41998-0027 UNABLE TO EXPLAIN THE CAUSE OF HIS COMRADE'S ABSENCE LECOQ ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEAD KEEPER IT WOULD SEEM THAT NO ONE HAS RECOGNIZED THE VICTIMS HE REMARKED NO ONE AND YET
6081-41998-0029 IT WOULD BRING IN A ROUND SUM MORE THAN ENOUGH TO COVER THE EXPENSES THE KEEPER'S REPLY SEEMED TO OFFER AN INDUCEMENT TO CONVERSATION BUT LECOQ DID NOT SEIZE IT
6081-41998-0030 BUT AFTER A MOMENT'S HESITATION HE VENTURED TO INQUIRE ARE YOU ONE OF THEM YES I AM REPLIED LECOQ EXHIBITING HIS CARD IN SUPPORT OF HIS ASSERTION AND YOUR NAME
6081-41998-0032 MONSIEUR LECOQ MONSIEUR THIS SIMPLE FORMULA OF POLITENESS BROUGHT A FAINT SMILE TO HIS LIPS
6081-41998-0033 WHEN AT ABOUT NINE O'CLOCK THREE YOUNG MEN ENTERED ARM IN ARM FROM THEIR MANNER AND APPEARANCE I JUDGED THEM TO BE CLERKS IN SOME STORE OR WAREHOUSE
6081-41998-0035 HIS COMRADES PUT THEIR HANDS OVER HIS MOUTH AND ONE OF THEM EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT YOU FOOL TO MIX YOURSELF UP WITH THIS AFFAIR DO YOU WANT TO GET US INTO TROUBLE THEREUPON THEY WENT OUT AND I FOLLOWED THEM
6081-41998-0036 BUT THE PERSON WHO HAD FIRST SPOKEN WAS SO OVERCOME THAT HE COULD SCARCELY DRAG HIMSELF ALONG AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE OBLIGED TO TAKE HIM TO A LITTLE RESTAURANT CLOSE BY I ENTERED IT MYSELF AND IT IS THERE I WRITE THIS LETTER
6081-41998-0038 S THE HANDWRITING OF THIS LETTER WAS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE AND THERE WERE MISTAKES IN SPELLING IN WELL NIGH EVERY LINE STILL ITS MEANING WAS CLEAR AND EXACT AND COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE THE MOST FLATTERING HOPES
6081-41998-0039 AS THE OLD COACHMAN URGED ON HIS HORSE HE COULD NOT REFRAIN FROM SAYING THINGS ARE GOING ON TO SUIT YOU A FRIENDLY HUSH WAS THE ONLY RESPONSE
6081-41998-0041 LECOQ HAD ENTERED THE LEFT WING OF THE PALAIS HE CLIMBED THE STAIRS TILL HE HAD REACHED THE THIRD FLOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO ENTER THE LONG NARROW BADLY LIGHTED CORRIDOR
6081-41998-0042 WHEN FINDING A DOORKEEPER INSTALLED BEHIND A HEAVY OAKEN DESK HE REMARKED
6081-42010-0000 HE FIRST OF ALL PROCEEDED TO THE PREFECTURE OF POLICE GOING THE LONGEST WAY ROUND AS A MATTER OF COURSE BUT ON REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE COULD FIND NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN THE YOUNG DETECTIVE ACCORDINGLY
6081-42010-0001 AND DEPENDENT ON THE CUSTOMERS IT BROUGHT THEM BEING OF A CONSCIENTIOUS TURN OF MIND HE ENTERED EACH ESTABLISHMENT IN SUCCESSION AND MEETING NOW AND AGAIN VARIOUS ACQUAINTANCES HE FELT COMPELLED TO PROFFER AND ACCEPT
6081-42010-0003 HE WAS RETURNING IN HASTE A TRIFLE UNEASY ON ACCOUNT OF THE LENGTH OF HIS ABSENCE WHEN HE PERCEIVED A CAB PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE PALAIS GATEWAY A SECOND GLANCE AND OH GREAT GOOD FORTUNE HE SAW LECOQ
6081-42010-0004 FATHER ABSINTHE AND THE VIRTUOUS TOINON ALIGHT FROM THIS VERY VEHICLE HIS PEACE OF MIND AT ONCE RETURNED AND IT WAS IN A VERY IMPORTANT AND SOMEWHAT HUSKY TONE
6081-42010-0006 HAS ASKED FOR YOU A NUMBER OF TIMES SAID HE HE HAS BEEN EXTREMELY IMPATIENT AND HE IS IN A VERY BAD HUMOR SO YOU MAY EXPECT TO HAVE YOUR HEAD SNAPPED OFF IN THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS MANNER LECOQ SMILED AS HE WENT UP THE STAIRS
6081-42010-0007 WAS HE NOT BRINGING WITH HIM THE MOST POTENT OF JUSTIFICATIONS HE THOUGHT OF THE AGREEABLE SURPRISE HE HAD IN STORE FOR THE MAGISTRATE AND FANCIED HE COULD PICTURE THE SUDDEN BRIGHTENING OF THAT FUNCTIONARY'S GLOOMY FACE
6081-42010-0009 WHEN HE SAW HOWEVER THAT THE MAGISTRATE WAS NOT ALONE AND WHEN HE RECOGNIZED POLYTE CHUPIN THE ORIGINAL OF THE PHOTOGRAPH
6081-42010-0010 HE INSTANTLY PERCEIVED HIS MISTAKE AND UNDERSTOOD ITS CONSEQUENCES THERE WAS ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE HE MUST PREVENT ANY EXCHANGE OF WORDS BETWEEN THE TWO
6081-42010-0012 JUST FOR ONE SECOND AND THEN SHE CAUGHT HIS WITHERING GLANCE AND HEARD HIS WORDS OF MENACE TERROR STRICKEN SHE STAGGERED BACK AND THEN LECOQ SEIZED HER AROUND THE WAIST
6081-42010-0013 AND LIFTING HER WITH HIS STRONG ARMS CARRIED HER OUT INTO THE PASSAGE THE WHOLE SCENE HAD BEEN SO BRIEF
6081-42010-0015 AH AH THOUGHT THE SMILING CLERK IN A FLUTTER OF DELIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW BUT AS THESE LITTLE DIVERSIONS NEVER MADE HIM FORGET HIS DUTIES HE LEANED TOWARD THE MAGISTRATE AND ASKED
6081-42010-0016 AND WORD FOR WORD IF YOU PLEASE HE PAUSED THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN THIS TIME TO ADMIT THE MAGISTRATE'S MESSENGER WHO TIMIDLY AND WITH A RATHER GUILTY AIR
6081-42010-0018 YET OBTAINING THE INFORMATION HE DESIRED LET US PROCEED HE SAID TO POLYTE WHO HAD NOT MOVED SINCE HIS WIFE HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE ROOM
6081-42010-0019 BEING TO ALL APPEARANCES SUBLIMELY INDIFFERENT TO EVERYTHING PASSING AROUND HIM TO THE MAGISTRATE'S PROPOSAL HE CARELESSLY NODDED ASSENT WAS THAT YOUR WIFE WHO CAME IN JUST NOW
6081-42010-0021 I INFLUENCE HER EVIDENCE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU BUT FOR THAT SUPPOSITION YOUR WORDS WOULD HAVE BEEN MEANINGLESS WHAT WORDS THE MAGISTRATE TURNED TO HIS CLERK
6081-42010-0022 READ THE LAST REMARK YOU TOOK DOWN IN A MONOTONOUS VOICE THE SMILING CLERK REPEATED I SHOULD LIKE TO KILL THE PERSON WHO DARED TO SAY THAT I KNEW LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0024 DON'T PREVARICATE ANY LONGER HE SAID YOU CERTAINLY ORDERED YOUR WIFE NOT TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LACHENEUR THAT'S EVIDENT WHY DID YOU DO SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF HER TELLING US
6081-42010-0025 DO YOU SUPPOSE THE POLICE ARE IGNORANT OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCE WITH LACHENEUR OF YOUR CONVERSATION WITH HIM WHEN HE CAME IN A CAB TO THE CORNER OF THE WASTE GROUND NEAR YOUR MOTHER'S WINE SHOP AND OF THE HOPES OF FORTUNE YOU BASED UPON HIS PROMISES
6081-42010-0027 AS THESE WORDS FELL ON POLYTE'S EARS IT WAS EVIDENT HIS IMPUDENCE AND INDIFFERENCE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE SHOCK HE SEEMED CONFOUNDED AND HUNG HIS HEAD AS IF THOROUGHLY ABASHED STILL HE PRESERVED AN OBSTINATE SILENCE
6081-42010-0028 AND THE MAGISTRATE FINDING THAT THIS LAST THRUST HAD FAILED TO PRODUCE ANY EFFECT GAVE UP THE FIGHT IN DESPAIR HE RANG THE BELL AND ORDERED THE GUARD TO CONDUCT THE WITNESS BACK TO PRISON
6081-42010-0030 BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE WAITING FOR ME AND MADE HASTE TO BRING HER HERE I THOUGHT I WAS ACTING FOR THE BEST NEVER MIND THE MISFORTUNE CAN BE REPAIRED NO SIR NO SINCE SHE HAS SEEN HER HUSBAND
6081-42010-0031 IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HER TO SPEAK SHE LOVES THAT RASCAL INTENSELY AND HE HAS A WONDERFUL INFLUENCE OVER HER YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID HE THREATENED HER WITH DEATH IF SHE BREATHED A WORD ABOUT LACHENEUR
6081-42010-0033 AGAIN SET FOOT IN HIS OFFICE THE POOR CREATURE SEEMED NEARLY HEARTBROKEN
6081-42010-0034 POLYTE'S THREAT HAD AROUSED THE MOST SINISTER APPREHENSIONS IN HER MIND NOT UNDERSTANDING HIS CONNECTION WITH THE AFFAIR SHE ASKED HERSELF IF HER TESTIMONY MIGHT NOT PROVE HIS DEATH WARRANT
6081-42010-0036 AT LAST SHE BURST INTO WILD DESPAIRING SOBS AND PRESSED HER FRIGHTENED CHILD AGAINST HER BREAST WHAT COULD BE DONE TO OVERCOME THIS FOOLISH OBSTINACY AS BLIND AND UNREASONING AS A BRUTE'S
6081-42010-0037 BUT REMEMBER THAT YOUR STRANGE SILENCE INJURES YOUR HUSBAND FAR MORE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD SAY SHE LEFT THE ROOM OR RATHER SHE RUSHED WILDLY FROM IT AS THOUGH ONLY TOO EAGER TO ESCAPE
6147-34605-0001 TO HAVE NO TIE UNTIL AS LATE AS POSSIBLE APPEARED TO HIM TO BE A PROLONGATION OF YOUTH MIDDLE AGED YOUNG MEN ABOUNDED IN THOSE RAKISH TIMES THEY GREW GRAY AS YOUNG FOPS THE WIG WAS AN ACCOMPLICE LATER ON POWDER BECAME THE AUXILIARY
6147-34605-0002 WOMEN TOO HAD THEIR SUCCESSES IN THE AUTUMN OF LIFE WITNESS NINON AND MARION SUCH WERE THE MODELS OF THE DAY JOSIANA AND DAVID CARRIED ON A FLIRTATION OF A PARTICULAR SHADE THEY DID NOT LOVE THEY PLEASED EACH OTHER
6147-34605-0004 JOSIANA THOUGHT GREAT THINGS OF HIS HORSES HIS DOGS HIS LOSSES AT PLAY HIS MISTRESSES LORD DAVID ON HIS SIDE BOWED DOWN BEFORE THE FASCINATIONS OF THE DUCHESS JOSIANA A MAIDEN WITHOUT SPOT OR SCRUPLE
6147-34605-0005 HAUGHTY INACCESSIBLE AND AUDACIOUS HE ADDRESSED SONNETS TO HER WHICH JOSIANA SOMETIMES READ IN THESE SONNETS HE DECLARED THAT TO POSSESS JOSIANA WOULD BE TO RISE TO THE STARS WHICH DID NOT PREVENT HIS ALWAYS PUTTING THE ASCENT OFF TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR
6147-34605-0007 I WHO WOULD DESIRE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO BE IN LOVE WITH HIM JOSIANA WAS THE FLESH NOTHING COULD BE MORE RESPLENDENT SHE WAS VERY TALL TOO TALL HER HAIR WAS OF THAT TINGE WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED RED GOLD SHE WAS PLUMP
6147-34605-0008 FRESH STRONG AND ROSY WITH IMMENSE BOLDNESS AND WIT SHE HAD EYES WHICH WERE TOO INTELLIGIBLE SHE HAD NEITHER LOVERS NOR CHASTITY SHE WALLED HERSELF ROUND WITH PRIDE
6147-34605-0010 SHE DISCOURSED ON LOCKE SHE WAS POLITE SHE WAS SUSPECTED OF KNOWING ARABIC TO BE THE FLESH AND TO BE WOMAN ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
6147-34605-0011 WHICH SO READILY TURNS TO LOVE JOSIANA WAS NOT NOT THAT SHE WAS UNFEELING THE ANCIENT COMPARISON OF FLESH TO MARBLE IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THE BEAUTY OF FLESH CONSISTS IN NOT BEING MARBLE
6147-34605-0013 THE KING HAD MADE HER A DUCHESS AND JUPITER A NEREID A DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF WHICH THE STRANGE BRIGHTNESS OF THIS CREATURE WAS COMPOSED IN ADMIRING HER YOU FELT YOURSELF BECOMING A PAGAN AND A LACKEY HER ORIGIN HAD BEEN BASTARDY AND THE OCEAN
6147-34605-0014 IF SHE HAD STABBED HERSELF IT WOULD LIKE LUCRETIA NOT HAVE BEEN UNTIL AFTERWARDS SHE WAS A VIRGIN STAINED WITH EVERY DEFILEMENT IN ITS VISIONARY STAGE SHE WAS A POSSIBLE ASTARTE IN A REAL DIANA SHE WAS IN THE INSOLENCE OF HIGH BIRTH
6147-34605-0016 TWO WITH ALL THAT SHE WAS A PRUDE IT WAS THE FASHION REMEMBER ELIZABETH ELIZABETH WAS OF A TYPE THAT PREVAILED IN ENGLAND FOR THREE CENTURIES
6147-34605-0017 THE SIXTEENTH SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH ELIZABETH WAS MORE THAN ENGLISH SHE WAS ANGLICAN HENCE THE DEEP RESPECT OF THE EPISCOPALIAN CHURCH FOR THAT QUEEN RESPECT RESENTED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WHICH COUNTERBALANCED IT WITH A DASH OF EXCOMMUNICATION
6147-34605-0019 MARY STUART PLAYED WITH THE FAN ELIZABETH WITH THE AXE AN UNEVEN MATCH THEY WERE RIVALS BESIDES IN LITERATURE MARY STUART COMPOSED FRENCH VERSES ELIZABETH TRANSLATED HORACE THE UGLY ELIZABETH DECREED HERSELF BEAUTIFUL
6147-34605-0020 LIKED QUATRAINS AND ACROSTICS HAD THE KEYS OF TOWNS PRESENTED TO HER BY CUPIDS BIT HER LIPS AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION ROLLED HER EYES AFTER THE SPANISH HAD IN HER WARDROBE THREE THOUSAND DRESSES AND COSTUMES
6147-34605-0023 JUNO RESOLVES HERSELF INTO ARAMINTA A PRETENSION TO DIVINITY NOT ADMITTED CREATES AFFECTATION IN DEFAULT OF THUNDERCLAPS THERE IS IMPERTINENCE THE TEMPLE SHRIVELS INTO THE BOUDOIR NOT HAVING THE POWER TO BE A GODDESS SHE IS AN IDOL
6147-34605-0024 A GRIMACE OF DISGUST CONCEALS CUPIDITY AND THEN WOMAN FEELS HER WEAK POINT GUARDED BY ALL THAT CASUISTRY OF GALLANTRY WHICH TAKES THE PLACE OF SCRUPLES IN PRUDES IT IS A LINE OF CIRCUMVALLATION WITH A DITCH EVERY PRUDE PUTS ON AN AIR OF REPUGNANCE
6147-34605-0026 DEGRADATION OF RANK AN ARISTOCRATIC PRELUDE BEGAN WHAT THE REVOLUTION WAS TO COMPLETE IT WAS NOT VERY FAR OFF THE TIME WHEN JELYOTTE WAS SEEN PUBLICLY SITTING IN BROAD DAYLIGHT ON THE BED OF THE MARQUISE D'EPINAY IT IS TRUE FOR MANNERS RE ECHO EACH OTHER
6147-34605-0027 THAT IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY SMETON'S NIGHTCAP HAD BEEN FOUND UNDER ANNE BOLEYN'S PILLOW IF THE WORD WOMAN SIGNIFIES FAULT AS I FORGET WHAT COUNCIL DECIDED NEVER WAS WOMAN SO WOMANLIKE AS THEN NEVER COVERING HER FRAILTY BY HER CHARMS
6147-34605-0029 ALL JOSIANA'S INSTINCTS IMPELLED HER TO YIELD HERSELF GALLANTLY RATHER THAN TO GIVE HERSELF LEGALLY TO SURRENDER ON THE SCORE OF GALLANTRY IMPLIES LEARNING
6147-34605-0030 IT WAS A NECESSITY DOUBTLESS BUT WHAT A PITY JOSIANA APPRECIATED LORD DAVID AND SHOWED HIM OFF THERE WAS BETWEEN THEM A TACIT AGREEMENT NEITHER TO CONCLUDE NOR TO BREAK OFF THE ENGAGEMENT THEY ELUDED EACH OTHER THIS METHOD OF MAKING LOVE ONE STEP IN ADVANCE AND TWO BACK
6147-34605-0032 THE BRUTALITY OF MARRIAGE CREATES DEFINITE SITUATIONS SUPPRESSES THE WILL KILLS CHOICE HAS A SYNTAX LIKE GRAMMAR REPLACES INSPIRATION BY ORTHOGRAPHY MAKES A DICTATION OF LOVE DISPERSES ALL LIFE'S MYSTERIES
6147-34605-0033 DIMINISHES THE RIGHTS BOTH OF SOVEREIGN AND SUBJECT BY A TURN OF THE SCALE DESTROYS THE CHARMING EQUILIBRIUM OF THE SEXES THE ONE ROBUST IN BODILY STRENGTH THE OTHER ALL POWERFUL IN FEMININE WEAKNESS STRENGTH ON ONE SIDE BEAUTY ON THE OTHER
6147-34605-0035 LORD DAVID WAS RIPENING FORTY TIS A MARKED PERIOD HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THIS AND IN TRUTH HE LOOKED NO MORE THAN THIRTY HE CONSIDERED IT MORE AMUSING TO DESIRE JOSIANA THAN TO POSSESS HER HE POSSESSED OTHERS HE HAD MISTRESSES
6147-34605-0036 ON THE OTHER HAND JOSIANA HAD DREAMS THE DUCHESS JOSIANA HAD A PECULIARITY LESS RARE THAN IT IS SUPPOSED ONE OF HER EYES WAS BLUE AND THE OTHER BLACK HER PUPILS WERE MADE FOR LOVE AND HATE FOR HAPPINESS AND MISERY
6147-34605-0038 SHE WAS A SKIN DEEP PAPIST HER CATHOLICISM DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY FOR FASHION
6147-34605-0039 SHE WORE GREAT DRESSES OF VELVET SATIN OR MOIRE SOME COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN OR SIXTEEN YARDS OF MATERIAL WITH EMBROIDERIES OF GOLD AND SILVER AND ROUND HER WAIST MANY KNOTS OF PEARLS ALTERNATING WITH OTHER PRECIOUS STONES SHE WAS EXTRAVAGANT IN GOLD LACE
6147-34606-0000 JUST AS IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOUR EUGENE DEVERIA WAS THE FIRST TO ALLOW HIS BEARD TO GROW
6147-34606-0001 DISGUISED BY ARTFUL CURLING FOR TO RISK ONE'S HAIR WAS ALMOST TO RISK ONE'S HEAD THE INDIGNATION WAS UNIVERSAL NEVERTHELESS
6147-34606-0003 HE HELD HIS GROUND PRINCE DEVEREUX WAS THE FIRST LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR THE SECOND IT IS SOMETIMES MORE DIFFICULT TO BE SECOND THAN FIRST IT REQUIRES LESS GENIUS BUT MORE COURAGE THE FIRST INTOXICATED BY THE NOVELTY MAY IGNORE THE DANGER
6147-34606-0004 MEN FOUND SUFFICIENT AUDACITY TO WEAR THEIR OWN HAIR AND POWDER WAS INTRODUCED AS AN EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCE IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH BEFORE WE PASS ON AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF HISTORY WE SHOULD REMARK THAT THE FIRST BLOW IN THE WAR OF WIGS WAS REALLY STRUCK BY A QUEEN
6147-34606-0006 THE LOWEST STAKE ALLOWED WAS A ROULEAU OF FIFTY GUINEAS AND THERE WAS NEVER LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND GUINEAS ON THE TABLE BY THE SIDE OF EACH PLAYER WAS A LITTLE STAND ON WHICH TO PLACE HIS CUP OF TEA AND A GILT BOWL IN WHICH TO PUT THE ROULEAUX OF GUINEAS THE PLAYERS LIKE SERVANTS WHEN CLEANING KNIVES
6147-34606-0007 WORE LEATHER SLEEVES TO SAVE THEIR LACE BREASTPLATES OF LEATHER TO PROTECT THEIR RUFFLES
6147-34606-0009 TRIBOULET DUNS HUDIBRAS SCARRON OVER THE CHIMNEY WAS A ESOP BETWEEN TWO MEN EACH BLIND OF AN EYE
6147-34606-0010 COCLES BEING BLIND OF THE LEFT CAMOENS OF THE RIGHT EYE SO ARRANGED THAT THE TWO PROFILES WITHOUT EYES WERE TURNED TO EACH OTHER THE DAY THAT THE BEAUTIFUL MISSUS VISART CAUGHT THE SMALL POX THE UGLY CLUB TOASTED HER THIS CLUB WAS STILL IN EXISTENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY
6147-34606-0012 THERE WAS THE FUN CLUB FUN IS LIKE CANT LIKE HUMOUR A WORD WHICH IS UNTRANSLATABLE FUN IS TO FARCE WHAT PEPPER IS TO SALT TO GET INTO A HOUSE AND BREAK A VALUABLE MIRROR SLASH THE FAMILY PORTRAITS POISON THE DOG
6147-34606-0013 TO GIVE BAD NEWS WHICH IS UNTRUE WHEREBY PEOPLE PUT ON MOURNING BY MISTAKE IS FUN IT WAS FUN TO CUT A SQUARE HOLE IN THE HOLBEIN AT HAMPTON COURT
6147-34606-0015 USED TO RUN ABOUT LONDON DURING THE HOURS WHEN THE CITIZENS WERE ASLEEP PULLING THE HINGES FROM THE SHUTTERS CUTTING OFF THE PIPES OF PUMPS FILLING UP CISTERNS DIGGING UP CULTIVATED PLOTS OF GROUND PUTTING OUT LAMPS SAWING THROUGH THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED HOUSES
6147-34606-0016 IT WAS THE RICH WHO ACTED THUS TOWARDS THE POOR FOR THIS REASON NO COMPLAINT WAS POSSIBLE THAT WAS THE BEST OF THE JOKE THOSE MANNERS HAVE NOT ALTOGETHER DISAPPEARED IN MANY PLACES IN ENGLAND AND IN ENGLISH POSSESSIONS AT GUERNSEY FOR INSTANCE
6147-34606-0018 THE GENTLEMAN BEHIND HIM CHASTISED HIM FOR THIS BY A PRICK OF HIS SWORD WHICH MADE HIM SPRING ROUND ANOTHER PRICK IN THE BACK WARNED THE FELLOW THAT ONE OF NOBLE BLOOD WAS BEHIND HIM AND SO ON EACH ONE WOUNDING HIM IN HIS TURN WHEN THE MAN CLOSED ROUND BY THE CIRCLE OF SWORDS AND COVERED WITH BLOOD
6147-34606-0019 HAD TURNED AND DANCED ABOUT ENOUGH THEY ORDERED THEIR SERVANTS TO BEAT HIM WITH STICKS TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF HIS IDEAS OTHERS HIT THE LION THAT IS THEY GAILY STOPPED A PASSENGER
6147-34606-0021 JUST LIKE ANY ONE ELSE HE WOULD GAILY SET FIRE TO A COT OF WOODWORK AND THATCH AND JUST SCORCH THOSE WITHIN BUT HE WOULD REBUILD THEIR HOUSES IN STONE HE INSULTED TWO LADIES ONE WAS UNMARRIED HE GAVE HER A PORTION THE OTHER WAS MARRIED HE HAD HER HUSBAND APPOINTED CHAPLAIN
6147-34606-0022 AND ALL THOSE ON THE NECK SO MUCH LESS FOR THE ENEMY'S BEAK HE USED TO SAY THEN HE EXTENDED THE COCK'S WINGS AND CUT EACH FEATHER ONE AFTER ANOTHER TO A POINT AND THUS THE WINGS WERE FURNISHED WITH DARTS SO MUCH FOR THE ENEMY'S EYES HE WOULD SAY
6147-34606-0024 THAT'S HOW TO MAKE A COCK AN EAGLE AND A BIRD OF THE POULTRY YARD A BIRD OF THE MOUNTAIN LORD DAVID ATTENDED PRIZE FIGHTS AND WAS THEIR LIVING LAW ON OCCASIONS OF GREAT PERFORMANCES
6147-34606-0025 AND FROM HIS OWN MOUTH FILLED WITH WATER BLOWING A FINE RAIN INTO HIS EYES AND EARS A THING WHICH REANIMATES EVEN A DYING MAN IF HE WAS REFEREE HE SAW THAT THERE WAS NO FOUL PLAY PREVENTED ANY ONE WHOSOEVER HE MIGHT BE FROM ASSISTING THE COMBATANTS EXCEPTING THE SECONDS
6147-34606-0027 AND FORBADE A MAN'S BEING HIT WHEN DOWN ALL THIS SCIENCE HOWEVER DID NOT RENDER HIM A PEDANT NOR DESTROY HIS EASE OF MANNER IN SOCIETY WHEN HE WAS REFEREE ROUGH PIMPLE FACED UNSHORN FRIENDS OF EITHER COMBATANT NEVER DARED TO COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAILING MAN
6147-34606-0028 LORD DAVID WAS ONE OF THE FEW REFEREES WHOM THEY DARED NOT THRASH NO ONE COULD TRAIN LIKE HIM THE PUGILIST WHOSE TRAINER HE CONSENTED TO BECOME WAS SURE TO WIN LORD DAVID WOULD CHOOSE A HERCULES MASSIVE AS A ROCK TALL AS A TOWER AND MAKE HIM HIS CHILD
6147-34606-0030 IT WAS HE WHO INVENTED THE ATHLETE'S ADMIRABLE RULES
6147-34606-0031 AFTER WHICH HE UNDRESSED HIS MAN RUBBED HIM AND PUT HIM TO BED IN THE STREET HE NEVER ALLOWED HIM TO LEAVE HIS SIGHT KEEPING HIM OUT OF EVERY DANGER RUNAWAY HORSES THE WHEELS OF CARRIAGES DRUNKEN SOLDIERS PRETTY GIRLS HE WATCHED OVER HIS VIRTUE
6147-34606-0033 IT IS NO EASY MATTER TO BECOME AN ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMAN LORD DAVID DIRRY MOIR WAS PASSIONATELY FOND OF OPEN AIR EXHIBITIONS OF SHOWS OF CIRCUSES WITH WILD BEASTS OF THE CARAVANS OF MOUNTEBANKS OF CLOWNS TUMBLERS MERRYMEN OPEN AIR FARCES AND THE WONDERS OF A FAIR
6147-34606-0034 THE TRUE NOBLE IS HE WHO SMACKS OF THE PEOPLE THEREFORE IT WAS THAT LORD DAVID FREQUENTED THE TAVERNS AND LOW HAUNTS OF LONDON AND THE CINQUE PORTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE AT NEED AND WITHOUT COMPROMISING HIS RANK IN THE WHITE SQUADRON TO BE CHEEK BY JOWL WITH A TOPMAN OR A CALKER
6147-34607-0001 HER STOUTNESS WAS BLOATED HER FUN HEAVY HER GOOD NATURE STUPID SHE WAS STUBBORN AND WEAK AS A WIFE SHE WAS FAITHLESS AND FAITHFUL HAVING FAVOURITES TO WHOM SHE GAVE UP HER HEART AND A HUSBAND FOR WHOM SHE KEPT HER BED
6147-34607-0002 AS A CHRISTIAN SHE WAS A HERETIC AND A BIGOT SHE HAD ONE BEAUTY
6147-34607-0004 SHE HAD A NARROW FOREHEAD SENSUAL LIPS FLESHY CHEEKS LARGE EYES SHORT SIGHT HER SHORT SIGHT EXTENDED TO HER MIND BEYOND A BURST OF MERRIMENT NOW AND THEN ALMOST AS PONDEROUS AS HER ANGER
6147-34607-0005 SHE LIVED IN A SORT OF TACITURN GRUMBLE AND A GRUMBLING SILENCE WORDS ESCAPED FROM HER WHICH HAD TO BE GUESSED AT SHE WAS A MIXTURE OF A GOOD WOMAN AND A MISCHIEVOUS DEVIL SHE LIKED SURPRISES WHICH IS EXTREMELY WOMAN LIKE ANNE WAS A PATTERN
6147-34607-0007 SHE EXCELLED IN BRINGING ABOUT GREAT CATASTROPHES FROM LITTLE CAUSES WHEN A WHIM OF AUTHORITY TOOK HOLD OF HER
6147-34607-0008 SHE DID NOT EXPLAIN HER THOUGHT SHE EXUDED IT THERE WAS SOMETHING OF THE SPHINX IN THIS GOOSE SHE RATHER LIKED FUN TEASING AND PRACTICAL JOKES COULD SHE HAVE MADE APOLLO A HUNCHBACK IT WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HER BUT SHE WOULD HAVE LEFT HIM A GOD
6147-34607-0010 WITH WHICH SHE REDDENED HER LIPS AND HAVING COLOURED HER MOUTH WOULD LAUGH SHE WAS GREEDILY FOND OF THE FLAT ZEALAND GINGERBREAD CAKES SHE WAS PROUD OF BEING FAT MORE OF A PURITAN THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHE WOULD NEVERTHELESS
6147-34607-0011 HAVE LIKED TO DEVOTE HERSELF TO STAGE PLAYS SHE HAD AN ABSURD ACADEMY OF MUSIC COPIED AFTER THAT OF FRANCE IN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED A FRENCHMAN NAMED FORETROCHE WANTED TO BUILD A ROYAL CIRCUS AT PARIS AT A COST OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS
6147-34607-0013 FOR CENTURIES ENGLAND SUFFERED UNDER THAT PROCESS OF TYRANNY WHICH GAVE THE LIE TO ALL THE OLD CHARTERS OF FREEDOM AND OUT OF WHICH FRANCE ESPECIALLY GATHERED A CAUSE OF TRIUMPH AND INDIGNATION WHAT IN SOME DEGREE DIMINISHES THE TRIUMPH IS THAT WHILE SAILORS WERE PRESSED IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0014 SOLDIERS WERE PRESSED IN FRANCE IN EVERY GREAT TOWN OF FRANCE ANY ABLE BODIED MAN GOING THROUGH THE STREETS ON HIS BUSINESS WAS LIABLE TO BE SHOVED BY THE CRIMPS INTO A HOUSE CALLED THE OVEN
6147-34607-0016 IN SIXTEEN NINETY FIVE THERE WERE THIRTY OF THESE OVENS IN PARIS THE LAWS AGAINST IRELAND EMANATING FROM QUEEN ANNE WERE ATROCIOUS ANNE WAS BORN IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR TWO YEARS BEFORE THE GREAT FIRE OF LONDON ON WHICH THE ASTROLOGERS THERE WERE SOME LEFT
6147-34607-0017 PREDICTED THAT BEING THE ELDER SISTER OF FIRE SHE WOULD BE QUEEN AND SO SHE WAS THANKS TO ASTROLOGY AND THE REVOLUTION OF SIXTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SHE HAD THE HUMILIATION OF HAVING ONLY GILBERT ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY FOR GODFATHER TO BE GODCHILD OF THE POPE WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE IN ENGLAND
6147-34607-0019 THERE WAS NEVER A BON MOT BUT IN FRENCH ANNE PAID A DEAL OF ATTENTION TO HER COINS ESPECIALLY TO COPPER COINS WHICH ARE THE LOW AND POPULAR ONES SHE WANTED TO CUT A GREAT FIGURE ON THEM SIX FARTHINGS WERE STRUCK DURING HER REIGN
6147-34607-0020 ON THE BACK OF THE FIRST THREE SHE HAD MERELY A THRONE STRUCK ON THE BACK OF THE FOURTH SHE ORDERED A TRIUMPHAL CHARIOT AND ON THE BACK OF THE SIXTH A GODDESS HOLDING A SWORD IN ONE HAND AND AN OLIVE BRANCH IN THE OTHER WITH THE SCROLL
6147-34607-0022 THREE ONE IDIOTIC HABIT OF THE PEOPLE IS TO ATTRIBUTE TO THE KING WHAT THEY DO THEMSELVES THEY FIGHT WHOSE THE GLORY THE KING'S THEY PAY WHOSE THE GENEROSITY THE KING'S THEN THE PEOPLE LOVE HIM FOR BEING SO RICH
6147-34607-0023 THE EQUESTRIAN STATUE RESERVED FOR KINGS ALONE IS AN EXCELLENT FIGURE OF ROYALTY THE HORSE IS THE PEOPLE ONLY THAT THE HORSE BECOMES TRANSFIGURED BY DEGREES IT BEGINS IN AN ASS IT ENDS IN A LION
6147-34607-0025 COUNTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN HER FLEET THE ENGLISH HAD THREE ARMIES FIVE THOUSAND MEN IN CATALONIA TEN THOUSAND IN PORTUGAL FIFTY THOUSAND IN FLANDERS
6147-34607-0026 TO MONARCHICAL AND DIPLOMATIC EUROPE A SORT OF PROSTITUTE THE ENGLISH PEOPLE HAS ALWAYS HAD IN KEEPING PARLIAMENT HAVING VOTED A PATRIOTIC LOAN OF THIRTY FOUR MILLION FRANCS OF ANNUITIES THERE HAD BEEN A CRUSH AT THE EXCHEQUER TO SUBSCRIBE IT
6147-34607-0028 WHAT GREAT THINGS ACCOMPLISHED HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE TO REFUSE ANNE ADMIRATION FOR TAKING THE TROUBLE OF LIVING AT THE PERIOD
6147-34607-0029 BEARS TO HIM THE VAGUE RESEMBLANCE OF A REFLECTION LIKE HIM SHE PLAYS AT A GREAT REIGN SHE HAS HER MONUMENTS HER ARTS HER VICTORIES HER CAPTAINS HER MEN OF LETTERS HER PRIVY PURSE TO PENSION CELEBRITIES HER GALLERY OF CHEFS D'OEUVRE
6147-34607-0031 IN IT THERE IS ENOUGH TO DECEIVE THE EYE ADD GOD SAVE THE QUEEN WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM LULLI AND THE ENSEMBLE BECOMES AN ILLUSION NOT A PERSONAGE IS MISSING CHRISTOPHER WREN IS A VERY PASSABLE MANSARD SOMERS IS AS GOOD AS LAMOIGNON ANNE HAS A RACINE IN DRYDEN
6147-34607-0032 A LOUVOIS IN PEMBROKE AND A TURENNE IN MARLBOROUGH HEIGHTEN THE WIGS AND LOWER THE FOREHEADS THE WHOLE IS SOLEMN AND POMPOUS AND THE WINDSOR OF THE TIME HAS A FADED RESEMBLANCE TO MARLY STILL THE WHOLE WAS EFFEMINATE AND ANNE'S PERE TELLIER WAS CALLED SARAH JENNINGS
6147-34607-0034 ALTHOUGH THE ENGLAND OF THE PERIOD QUARRELS AND FIGHTS FRANCE SHE IMITATES HER AND DRAWS ENLIGHTENMENT FROM HER AND THE LIGHT ON THE FACADE OF ENGLAND IS FRENCH LIGHT IT IS A PITY THAT ANNE'S REIGN LASTED BUT TWELVE YEARS OR THE ENGLISH WOULD NOT HESITATE TO CALL IT THE CENTURY OF ANNE
6147-34607-0035 WAS GREATLY ADMIRED IN ENGLAND HE IS THE KIND OF KING THEY WANT IN FRANCE SAID THE ENGLISH THE LOVE OF THE ENGLISH FOR THEIR OWN LIBERTY IS MINGLED WITH A CERTAIN ACCEPTANCE OF SERVITUDE FOR OTHERS THAT FAVOURABLE REGARD OF THE CHAINS WHICH BIND THEIR NEIGHBOURS
6147-34607-0037 WAS A CAUSE OF VEXATION TO THE QUEEN TO AN UGLY QUEEN A PRETTY DUCHESS IS NOT AN AGREEABLE SISTER THERE WAS ANOTHER GRIEVANCE JOSIANA'S IMPROPER BIRTH ANNE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF ANNE HYDE A SIMPLE GENTLEWOMAN LEGITIMATELY
6147-34607-0038 ANNE HAVING THIS INFERIOR BLOOD IN HER VEINS FELT HERSELF BUT HALF ROYAL AND JOSIANA HAVING COME INTO THE WORLD QUITE IRREGULARLY DREW CLOSER ATTENTION TO THE INCORRECTNESS LESS GREAT BUT REALLY EXISTING IN THE BIRTH OF THE QUEEN
6147-34607-0040 THIS WAS A BORE FOR HER ROYAL MAJESTY WHY THIS JOSIANA WHAT HAD PUT IT INTO HER HEAD TO BE BORN WHAT GOOD WAS A JOSIANA CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS ARE DETRIMENTAL
6181-216552-0000 POTHIER SEEMS TO THINK THAT PROPERTY LIKE ROYALTY EXISTS BY DIVINE RIGHT HE TRACES BACK ITS ORIGIN TO GOD HIMSELF
6181-216552-0002 FOR THE HUMAN RACE HE HAS CREATED THE EARTH AND ALL ITS CREATURES AND HAS GIVEN IT A CONTROL OVER THEM SUBORDINATE ONLY TO HIS OWN THOU MADEST HIM TO HAVE DOMINION OVER THE WORKS OF THY HANDS
6181-216552-0003 THOU HAST PUT ALL THINGS UNDER HIS FEET SAYS THE PSALMIST GOD ACCOMPANIED THIS GIFT WITH THESE WORDS ADDRESSED TO OUR FIRST PARENTS AFTER THE CREATION BE FRUITFUL AND MULTIPLY
6181-216552-0005 AND I HAVE NOT WHERE TO LAY MY HEAD MULTIPLY HE TELLS US THROUGH HIS INTERPRETER POTHIER AH LEARNED POTHIER THAT IS AS EASY TO DO AS TO SAY
6181-216552-0006 BUT YOU MUST GIVE MOSS TO THE BIRD FOR ITS NEST THE HUMAN RACE HAVING MULTIPLIED MEN DIVIDED AMONG THEMSELVES THE EARTH AND MOST OF THE THINGS UPON IT THAT WHICH FELL TO EACH
6181-216552-0008 WHETHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IT MATTERS LITTLE THEN THERE WAS NO PROPERTY NOT EVEN PRIVATE POSSESSION THE GENESIS AND GROWTH OF POSSESSION GRADUALLY FORCING PEOPLE TO LABOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT
6181-216552-0009 THEY AGREED EITHER FORMALLY OR TACITLY IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHICH THAT THE LABORER SHOULD BE SOLE PROPRIETOR OF THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR THAT IS THEY SIMPLY DECLARED THE FACT
6181-216552-0011 THERE MUST BE EQUALITY OF FACILITIES FOR LABOR WHOEVER WITHOUT LABOR GOT POSSESSION BY FORCE OR BY STRATEGY OF ANOTHER'S MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE DESTROYED EQUALITY
6181-216552-0012 WHOEVER VIOLATED IT WAS UNJUST THUS LABOR GIVES BIRTH TO PRIVATE POSSESSION THE RIGHT IN A THING
6181-216552-0014 WHO ADMIT A MAN'S PROPERTY IN THE FLOCKS WHICH HE HAS RAISED DO NOT REFUSE THE CROP TO HIM WHO PLANTED THE SEED BUT THEY DO NOT SEE WHY ANOTHER HIS EQUAL SHOULD NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO PLANT IN HIS TURN
6181-216552-0015 THE INEQUALITY WHICH RESULTS FROM THE PRETENDED RIGHT OF THE FIRST OCCUPANT SEEMS TO THEM TO BE BASED ON NO PRINCIPLE OF JUSTICE AND WHEN ALL THE LAND FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF INHABITANTS
6181-216552-0017 AND THAT THIS METHOD OF DISTRIBUTION FIXED AND DURABLE IS ADVANTAGEOUS TO PRODUCTION BUT HOW COULD THIS DIVISION GIVE TO EACH A TRANSFERABLE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IN A THING TO WHICH
6181-216552-0018 ALL HAD AN INALIENABLE RIGHT OF POSSESSION
6181-216552-0020 AND THE MUTUAL CONCESSIONS OF THOSE WHO SHARE THE LAND ARE NOTHING LESS THAN TRAFFIC IN NATURAL RIGHTS THE ORIGINAL CULTIVATORS OF THE LAND WHO WERE ALSO THE ORIGINAL MAKERS OF THE LAW WERE NOT AS LEARNED
6181-216552-0021 INTO THE RIGHT OF ABSOLUTE PROPERTY BUT WHY HAVE NOT THOSE WHO IN LATER TIMES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN JUS IN RE AND JUS AD REM
6181-216552-0023 DOMINIUM NON POTEST NISI EX UNA CAUSA
6181-216552-0024 I CAN POSSESS BY SEVERAL TITLES I CAN BECOME PROPRIETOR BY ONLY ONE
6181-216552-0026 I AM THE ORIGINAL OCCUPANT IF I APPEAL TO MY LABOR IT WILL SAY IT IS ONLY ON THAT CONDITION THAT YOU POSSESS IF I SPEAK OF AGREEMENTS IT WILL RESPOND
6181-216552-0027 THESE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISH ONLY YOUR RIGHT OF USE SUCH HOWEVER ARE THE ONLY TITLES WHICH PROPRIETORS ADVANCE THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ANY OTHERS INDEED EVERY RIGHT
6181-216552-0029 IN THIS SON OF EARTH WHO PASSES AWAY LIKE A SHADOW THERE EXISTS WITH RESPECT TO EXTERNAL THINGS ONLY TITLES OF POSSESSION NOT ONE TITLE OF PROPERTY WHY THEN
6181-216552-0030 HAS SOCIETY RECOGNIZED A RIGHT INJURIOUS TO ITSELF WHERE THERE IS NO PRODUCING CAUSE WHY IN ACCORDING POSSESSION HAS IT ALSO CONCEDED PROPERTY WHY HAS THE LAW SANCTIONED THIS ABUSE OF POWER
6181-216552-0032 TO THE FORM WHICH HE GIVES TO THE OBJECT NOT TO THE OBJECT ITSELF USELESS DISTINCTION IF THE FORM COULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT PERHAPS THERE WOULD BE ROOM FOR QUESTION
6181-216552-0033 BUT AS THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS IMPOSSIBLE THE APPLICATION OF MAN'S STRENGTH TO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE VISIBLE WORLD IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY THE PRIMARY ORIGIN OF RICHES
6181-216552-0035 SOCIETY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO FIX THE CONDITIONS OF PROPERTY LET US SUPPOSE THAT AN APPROPRIATED FARM YIELDS A GROSS INCOME OF TEN THOUSAND FRANCS AND AS VERY SELDOM HAPPENS
6181-216552-0036 THE POSSESSOR OF THIS FARM SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO GUARD HIS REPUTATION AS A GOOD FATHER OF A FAMILY BY PAYING TO SOCIETY TEN THOUSAND FRANCS LESS THE TOTAL COSTS OF CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0038 WHEREAS SINCE LABOR SO CHANGES THE FORM OF A THING THAT THE FORM AND SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE SEPARATED WITHOUT DESTROYING THE THING ITSELF EITHER SOCIETY MUST BE DISINHERITED
6181-216552-0039 OR THE LABORER MUST LOSE THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR AND WHEREAS IN EVERY OTHER CASE PROPERTY IN RAW MATERIAL WOULD GIVE A TITLE TO ADDED IMPROVEMENTS MINUS THEIR COST
6181-216552-0041 SHALL NEVER BE ADMITTED AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BUT ONLY AGAINST SOCIETY IN SUCH A WAY DO LEGISLATORS ALWAYS REASON IN REGARD TO PROPERTY
6181-216552-0042 THE LAW IS INTENDED TO PROTECT MEN'S MUTUAL RIGHTS THAT IS THE RIGHTS OF EACH AGAINST EACH AND EACH AGAINST ALL
6181-216552-0044 THAT IS OPPOSED TO THE SOCIETY WHICH HE HIMSELF REPRESENTS JURISPRUDENCE IS AT FAULT THEMIS HAS LOST ONE SCALE OF HER BALANCE LISTEN TO THE PROFESSOR OF RENNES THE LEARNED TOULLIER
6181-216552-0045 POSSESSION AGRICULTURE WAS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE AND AGRICULTURE IN ITS TURN FAVORS POPULATION AND NECESSITATES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PERMANENT PROPERTY
6181-216552-0047 PROTECTED IN HIS RIGHT OF OCCUPATION OF LAND AS LONG AS HE REMAINED ITS CULTIVATOR THAT WAS ALL THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT WAS ALL THAT THE ADVANCE OF CIVILIZATION DEMANDED
6181-216552-0048 BUT PROPERTY PROPERTY THE RIGHT OF ESCHEAT OVER LANDS WHICH ONE NEITHER OCCUPIES NOR CULTIVATES
6181-216552-0050 THE CIVIL STATE WAS NEEDED THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE HUMAN RACE HAD RENDERED AGRICULTURE NECESSARY THE NEED OF SECURING TO THE CULTIVATOR THE FRUIT OF HIS LABOR MADE PERMANENT PROPERTY NECESSARY
6181-216552-0051 AND ALSO LAWS FOR ITS PROTECTION SO WE ARE INDEBTED TO PROPERTY FOR THE CREATION OF THE CIVIL STATE
6181-216552-0053 TO SUBORDINATE MEN TO THE WHOLESOME YOKE OF THE LAW AND WITHOUT PERMANENT PROPERTY THE EARTH WOULD HAVE REMAINED A VAST FOREST LET US ADMIT THEN
6181-216552-0054 IT IS THE CIVIL LAW WHICH HOLDS THAT WHEN ONCE ACQUIRED PROPERTY CAN BE LOST ONLY BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR AND THAT IT EXISTS EVEN AFTER THE PROPRIETOR HAS RELINQUISHED POSSESSION OF THE THING
6181-216552-0056 HAVE NOTHING WHATEVER IN COMMON IN THIS WE SEE WHAT A WONDERFUL CHANGE HAS BEEN EFFECTED IN PROPERTY AND TO WHAT AN EXTENT NATURE HAS BEEN ALTERED BY THE CIVIL LAWS THUS THE LAW IN ESTABLISHING PROPERTY
6181-216552-0057 THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATURAL LAW THE APPLICATION OF A MORAL PRINCIPLE IT HAS LITERALLY CREATED A RIGHT OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN PROVINCE IT HAS REALIZED AN ABSTRACTION A METAPHOR
6181-216552-0059 BLIND LAW THE LAW OF THE IGNORANT MAN A LAW WHICH IS NOT A LAW THE VOICE OF DISCORD DECEIT AND BLOOD THIS IT IS WHICH CONTINUALLY REVIVED REINSTATED REJUVENATED
6181-216552-0060 RESTORED RE ENFORCED AS THE PALLADIUM OF SOCIETY HAS TROUBLED THE CONSCIENCES OF THE PEOPLE HAS OBSCURED THE MINDS OF THE MASTERS AND HAS INDUCED ALL THE CATASTROPHES
6181-216552-0062 BUT INDEED WHAT GUIDE DID THE LAW FOLLOW IN CREATING THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY WHAT PRINCIPLE DIRECTED IT WHAT WAS ITS STANDARD WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT IT WAS EQUALITY
6181-216552-0063 UNLESS THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION WERE AT THE SAME TIME SECURED TO HIM TO FORTIFY THE WEAK AGAINST THE INVASION OF THE STRONG TO SUPPRESS SPOLIATION AND FRAUD
6181-216552-0065 A MULTITUDE OF RIGHTS SOME FOUNDED IN NATURE BUT WRONGLY INTERPRETED AND STILL MORE WRONGLY APPLIED INHERITANCE GIFT AND EXCHANGE OTHERS LIKE THE PRIVILEGES OF BIRTH AND POSITION
6181-216552-0066 FOR THE BARBARIANS INSTEAD OF INDULGING IN ANNUAL QUARRELS AND FIGHTS INSTEAD OF CONTINUALLY MOVING THEIR HOUSES FURNITURE AND FAMILIES FROM SPOT TO SPOT THAN TO ASSIGN TO EACH INDIVIDUAL A FIXED AND INALIENABLE ESTATE
6181-216552-0068 AND BY THE ACTION OF THE PROPRIETOR IT WAS NECESSARY THAT THE EQUALITY IN THE DIVISION SHOULD BE KEPT UP FROM ONE GENERATION TO ANOTHER WITHOUT A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF THE LAND UPON THE DEATH OF EACH FAMILY
6181-216552-0069 THE FEUDAL AND PATRIARCHAL CUSTOM OF RECOGNIZING ONLY ONE HEIR THEN BY A QUITE CONTRARY APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY THE ADMISSION OF ALL THE CHILDREN TO A SHARE IN THEIR FATHER'S ESTATE
6181-216552-0071 BY WHICH SOCIAL WANTS MUST BE SATISFIED THE PEOPLE DO NOT VOTE IT THE LEGISLATOR DOES NOT EXPRESS IT THE SAVANT DISCOVERS AND FORMULATES IT BUT IN FACT THE LAW
6181-216552-0072 WAS IN THE BEGINNING ONLY THE EXPRESSION OF A WANT AND THE INDICATION OF THE MEANS OF SUPPLYING IT AND UP TO THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN NOTHING ELSE THE LEGISTS WITH MECHANICAL FIDELITY
6181-216552-0074 TO BE SURE WERE WELL MEANING BUT WANTING IN FORESIGHT THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE OLD FOUNDERS OF THE DOMAIN OF PROPERTY THAT THE PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO RETAIN ONE'S ESTATE A RIGHT WHICH SEEMED TO THEM
6181-216552-0075 EQUITABLE BECAUSE IT WAS COMMON INVOLVES THE RIGHT TO TRANSFER SELL GIVE GAIN AND LOSE IT THAT IT TENDS CONSEQUENTLY TO NOTHING LESS THAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THAT EQUALITY
6181-216552-0077 THEY DID NOT FORESEE THESE INGENUOUS LEGISLATORS THAT IF PROPERTY IS RETAINABLE BY INTENT ALONE NUDO ANIMO
6181-216552-0078 IT CARRIES WITH IT THE RIGHT TO LET TO LEASE TO LOAN AT INTEREST TO PROFIT BY EXCHANGE TO SETTLE ANNUITIES AND TO LEVY A TAX ON A FIELD WHICH INTENT RESERVES
6181-216552-0080 FAMILIES WILL SOON BECOME VICTIMS OF THE MOST DISASTROUS EXCLUSIONS AND SOCIETY
6181-216552-0081 WILL COME TO ITS DEATH THROUGH OPULENCE
6181-216552-0083 OTHERS WISH HIM TO BE CHOSEN BY THE DECEASED OR ASSUMED BY THE LAW TO BE SO CHOSEN
6181-216552-0084 TO DAY THE REAL CONTROLLER OF INHERITANCE IS CHANCE OR CAPRICE NOW IN MATTERS OF LEGISLATION CHANCE AND CAPRICE CANNOT BE ACCEPTED AS GUIDES
6181-216552-0086 WHICH SERVES AS A VOICE BY WHICH SOCIETY ASKS US TO CHOOSE FROM AMONG ALL OUR BROTHERS HIM WHOM WE JUDGE BEST FITTED TO COMPLETE OUR UNFINISHED WORK THEY DID NOT FORESEE
6181-216552-0087 BUT WHY NEED I GO FARTHER THE CONSEQUENCES ARE PLAIN ENOUGH AND THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO CRITICISE THE WHOLE CODE THE HISTORY OF PROPERTY AMONG THE ANCIENT NATIONS IS THEN
6181-216552-0089 THEN THE UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY DOES NOT LEGITIMATE THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY MAN IS MISTAKEN AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF SOCIETY THE NATURE OF RIGHT
6181-216552-0090 OF WHAT CONSEQUENCE IS IT TO US THAT THE INDIAN RACE WAS DIVIDED INTO FOUR CLASSES THAT ON THE BANKS OF THE NILE AND THE GANGES BLOOD AND POSITION FORMERLY DETERMINED
6181-216552-0092 THE VARIETY OF THE FORMS OF PRIVILEGE DOES NOT SANCTION INJUSTICE THE FAITH OF JUPITER
6181-216552-0093 THAN DO THE MYSTERIES OF VENUS THE WANTON AGAINST CONJUGAL CHASTITY THE AUTHORITY OF THE HUMAN RACE IS OF NO EFFECT AS EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY BECAUSE THIS RIGHT
6181-216552-0095 THE SOCIAL ADVANTAGES ATTRIBUTED TO PROPERTY CANNOT BE CITED IN ITS BEHALF BECAUSE THEY ALL SPRING FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF POSSESSION WHAT MEANS THEN THIS DITHYRAMB UPON PROPERTY
6181-216552-0096 THE SHELTER OF HIS FAMILY IN A WORD THE CORNER STONE OF THE DOMESTIC DWELLING OF COMMUNITIES AND OF THE POLITICAL STATE POSSESSION ALONE PRODUCED ALL THAT
6181-216552-0098 EVERY INSTITUTION AND EVERY LAW BASED ON PROPERTY WILL PERISH IT IS A BOON AS PRECIOUS AS LIBERTY FOR THE RICH PROPRIETOR IN FACT THE CAUSE OF THE CULTIVATION
6181-216552-0099 OF THE HABITABLE EARTH IF THE CULTIVATOR CEASED TO BE A TENANT WOULD THE LAND BE WORSE CARED FOR THE GUARANTEE AND THE MORALITY OF LABOR UNDER THE REGIME OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0101 ALL MORALITY A FAMISHED STOMACH KNOWS NO MORALITY ALL PUBLIC ORDER CERTAINLY THE PRESERVATION OF PROPERTY
6181-216552-0102 STUMBLING BLOCK OF ALL WHICH OUGHT TO BE SUCH IS PROPERTY TO SUM UP AND CONCLUDE NOT ONLY DOES OCCUPATION LEAD TO EQUALITY IT PREVENTS PROPERTY
6181-216552-0104 ON THE OTHER HAND THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS VARIES CONTINUALLY WITH THE BIRTHS AND DEATHS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE QUANTITY
6181-216552-0105 OF MATERIAL WHICH EACH LABORER MAY CLAIM VARIES WITH THE NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS CONSEQUENTLY THAT OCCUPATION IS ALWAYS SUBORDINATE TO POPULATION FINALLY THAT INASMUCH AS POSSESSION
6181-216552-0107 HE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE THING ENTRUSTED TO HIM HE MUST USE IT IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERAL UTILITY WITH A VIEW TO ITS PRESERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT HE HAS NO POWER TO TRANSFORM IT
6181-216552-0108 TO DIMINISH IT OR TO CHANGE ITS NATURE HE CANNOT SO DIVIDE THE USUFRUCT THAT ANOTHER SHALL PERFORM THE LABOR WHILE HE RECEIVES THE PRODUCT IN A WORD
6181-216552-0110 WHICH ALONE IS THE PERMANENT POSSESSOR THE INDIVIDUAL PASSES AWAY SOCIETY IS DEATHLESS WHAT A PROFOUND DISGUST FILLS MY SOUL WHILE DISCUSSING SUCH SIMPLE TRUTHS
6181-216552-0111 THE AMOUNT OCCUPIED BEING MEASURED NOT BY THE WILL BUT BY THE VARIABLE CONDITIONS OF SPACE AND NUMBER PROPERTY CANNOT EXIST
6181-216552-0113 BUT I HEAR THE EXCLAMATIONS OF THE PARTISANS OF ANOTHER SYSTEM LABOR LABOR THAT IS THE BASIS OF PROPERTY READER DO NOT BE DECEIVED
6209-34599-0000 A BURDEN MAKES A ROUGH ROAD ROUGHER IT WAS LITTLE MORE THAN FOUR HOURS SINCE THE HOOKER HAD SAILED FROM THE CREEK OF PORTLAND LEAVING THE BOY ON THE SHORE
6209-34599-0002 A WOMAN THE WOMAN IN THE SNOW AND THE LITTLE GIRL WHOM HE WAS CARRYING IN HIS ARMS HE WAS EXHAUSTED BY FATIGUE AND HUNGER YET ADVANCED MORE RESOLUTELY THAN EVER WITH LESS STRENGTH AND AN ADDED BURDEN
6209-34599-0003 THAT WHICH HE LOST WAS NOT THROWN AWAY BUT WAS GAINED BY HER HE FOUND OUT THAT THE POOR INFANT ENJOYED THE COMFORT WHICH WAS TO HER THE RENEWAL OF LIFE HE CONTINUED TO ADVANCE
6209-34599-0005 HE PUT A LITTLE SNOW IN HIS MOUTH AND SUCKED IT THIS FOR A MOMENT ASSUAGED HIS THIRST BUT CHANGED IT INTO FEVER A RELIEF WHICH WAS AN AGGRAVATION THE STORM HAD BECOME SHAPELESS FROM ITS VIOLENCE
6209-34599-0006 DELUGES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE THIS WAS ONE
6209-34599-0008 FOR A LONG TIME HE HAD CEASED TO SEE THE SMOKE SUCH INDICATIONS ARE SOON EFFACED IN THE NIGHT BESIDES IT WAS PAST THE HOUR WHEN FIRES ARE PUT OUT OR HE HAD PERHAPS MADE A MISTAKE
6209-34599-0009 DOUBTING HE YET PERSEVERED TWO OR THREE TIMES THE LITTLE INFANT CRIED THEN HE ADOPTED IN HIS GAIT A ROCKING MOVEMENT AND THE CHILD WAS SOOTHED AND SILENCED
6209-34599-0011 SO THAT THE FROST SHOULD NOT GET IN THROUGH ANY OPENING AND THAT NO MELTED SNOW SHOULD DROP BETWEEN THE GARMENT AND THE CHILD THE PLAIN WAS UNEQUAL IN THE DECLIVITIES INTO WHICH IT SLOPED THE SNOW
6209-34599-0012 DRIVEN BY THE WIND INTO THE DIPS OF THE GROUND WAS SO DEEP IN COMPARISON WITH A CHILD SO SMALL THAT IT ALMOST ENGULFED HIM AND HE HAD TO STRUGGLE THROUGH IT HALF BURIED HE WALKED ON WORKING AWAY THE SNOW WITH HIS KNEES
6209-34599-0014 HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID SO HE SHOULD NEVER RISE AGAIN HE WAS OVERCOME BY FATIGUE AND THE WEIGHT OF THE DARKNESS WOULD AS WITH THE DEAD WOMAN HAVE HELD HIM TO THE GROUND AND THE ICE GLUED HIM ALIVE TO THE EARTH
6209-34599-0015 HE HAD TRIPPED UPON THE SLOPES OF PRECIPICES AND HAD RECOVERED HIMSELF
6209-34599-0017 EVERYWHERE THERE WAS RIME AND FROZEN SNOW THE LITTLE CREATURE WHOM HE CARRIED MADE HIS PROGRESS FEARFULLY DIFFICULT SHE WAS NOT ONLY A BURDEN WHICH HIS WEARINESS AND EXHAUSTION MADE EXCESSIVE BUT WAS ALSO AN EMBARRASSMENT
6209-34599-0018 SHE OCCUPIED BOTH HIS ARMS AND TO HIM WHO WALKS OVER ICE BOTH ARMS ARE A NATURAL AND NECESSARY BALANCING POWER HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO WITHOUT THIS BALANCE HE DID WITHOUT IT AND ADVANCED
6209-34599-0020 AND ACCOMPLISHING WITHOUT SPECTATORS MIRACLES OF EQUILIBRIUM LET US REPEAT THAT HE WAS PERHAPS FOLLOWED ON THIS PATH OF PAIN BY EYES UNSLEEPING IN THE DISTANCES OF THE SHADOWS THE EYES OF THE MOTHER AND THE EYES OF GOD
6209-34599-0021 HE STAGGERED SLIPPED RECOVERED HIMSELF TOOK CARE OF THE INFANT AND GATHERING THE JACKET ABOUT HER HE COVERED UP HER HEAD STAGGERED AGAIN ADVANCED SLIPPED THEN DREW HIMSELF UP THE COWARDLY WIND DROVE AGAINST HIM
6209-34599-0023 HOMESTEADS AND COTTAGES OCCUPY THE PLACE OF WASTE LANDS SOMETIMES LESS THAN A CENTURY SEPARATES A STEPPE FROM A CITY SUDDENLY A LULL HAVING OCCURRED IN THE ICY BLAST WHICH WAS BLINDING HIM
6209-34599-0024 HE PERCEIVED AT A SHORT DISTANCE IN FRONT OF HIM A CLUSTER OF GABLES AND OF CHIMNEYS SHOWN IN RELIEF BY THE SNOW THE REVERSE OF A SILHOUETTE A CITY PAINTED IN WHITE ON A BLACK HORIZON
6209-34599-0026 THE WATCH OF A SHIP WHICH HAS WANDERED FROM HER COURSE FEELS SOME SUCH EMOTION WHEN HE CRIES LAND HO HE HURRIED HIS STEPS AT LENGTH THEN HE WAS NEAR MANKIND
6209-34599-0027 THERE GLOWED WITHIN HIM THAT SUDDEN WARMTH SECURITY THAT OUT OF WHICH HE WAS EMERGING WAS OVER THENCEFORWARD THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE NIGHT NOR WINTER NOR TEMPEST
6209-34599-0029 HE ALMOST RAN HIS EYES WERE FIXED ON THE ROOFS THERE WAS LIFE THERE HE NEVER TOOK HIS EYES OFF THEM A DEAD MAN MIGHT GAZE THUS ON WHAT MIGHT APPEAR THROUGH THE HALF OPENED LID OF HIS SEPULCHRE
6209-34599-0030 THERE WERE THE CHIMNEYS OF WHICH HE HAD SEEN THE SMOKE NO SMOKE AROSE FROM THEM NOW HE WAS NOT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED THE HOUSES HE CAME TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF A TOWN AN OPEN STREET
6209-34599-0032 SO FAR AS EYE COULD REACH THE HOUSE TO THE RIGHT WAS A ROOF RATHER THAN A HOUSE NOTHING COULD BE MORE MEAN THE WALLS WERE OF MUD THE ROOF WAS OF STRAW AND THERE WAS MORE THATCH THAN WALL
6209-34599-0033 A LARGE NETTLE SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL REACHED THE ROOF THE HOVEL HAD BUT ONE DOOR WHICH WAS LIKE THAT OF A DOG KENNEL AND A WINDOW WHICH WAS BUT A HOLE ALL WAS SHUT UP AT THE SIDE
6209-34599-0035 OPPOSITE TO THAT OF THE PAUPER THE BOY DID NOT HESITATE HE APPROACHED THE GREAT MANSION THE DOUBLE FOLDING DOOR OF MASSIVE OAK STUDDED WITH LARGE NAILS WAS OF THE KIND THAT LEADS ONE TO EXPECT
6209-34599-0036 NO ANSWER HE STRUCK AGAIN AND TWO KNOCKS NO MOVEMENT WAS HEARD IN THE HOUSE HE KNOCKED A THIRD TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND HE SAW THAT THEY WERE ALL ASLEEP AND DID NOT CARE TO GET UP
6209-34599-0038 THE HOUSE OF STONE AND THE THATCHED HOVEL WERE EQUALLY DEAF TO THE WRETCHED THE BOY DECIDED ON PUSHING ON FURTHER
6209-34600-0000 ANOTHER FORM OF DESERT IT WAS WEYMOUTH WHICH HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEYMOUTH THEN WAS NOT THE RESPECTABLE AND FINE WEYMOUTH OF TO DAY ANCIENT WEYMOUTH DID NOT PRESENT LIKE THE PRESENT ONE
6209-34600-0002 GEORGE THE THIRD HAVING LOST IN HIS OLD AGE THE INTELLECT HE HAD NEVER POSSESSED IN HIS YOUTH WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALAMITIES OF HIS REIGN HE WAS AN INNOCENT WHY NOT ERECT STATUES TO HIM
6209-34600-0003 EVEN GOOD WOMEN IN THEIR HOUSES A PELL MELL OF SHEDS THROWN FROM HER DEVIL'S BAG WOULD GIVE AN IDEA OF THAT IRREGULAR WEYMOUTH THE GOOD WOMEN IN THE SHEDS INCLUDED THE MUSIC HALL REMAINS AS A SPECIMEN OF THOSE BUILDINGS
6209-34600-0005 AND LEAVING BETWEEN THEM AWKWARD SPACES OF NARROW AND WINDING CHANNELS LANES AND PASSAGES OFTEN FLOODED
6209-34600-0006 THE DESERTED CHILD CARRYING THE FOUNDLING PASSED THROUGH THE FIRST STREET THEN THE SECOND THEN THE THIRD
6209-34600-0008 HE KNEW THIS BECAUSE HE FELT HER SUCK HIS CHEEK SHE DID NOT CRY BELIEVING HIM HER MOTHER HE WAS ABOUT TO TURN AND WANDER LONG PERHAPS IN THE INTERSECTIONS OF THE SCRAMBRIDGE LANES
6209-34600-0009 THEN MORE CULTIVATED PLOTS THAN DWELLINGS MORE THORN HEDGES THAN HOUSES BUT FORTUNATELY HE STRUCK INTO A PASSAGE WHICH EXISTS TO THIS DAY NEAR TRINITY SCHOOLS THIS PASSAGE LED HIM TO A WATER BRINK
6209-34600-0011 THE VILLAGE HAS ABSORBED THE CITY IT WAS THE BRIDGE WHICH DID THE WORK BRIDGES ARE STRANGE VEHICLES OF SUCTION WHICH INHALE THE POPULATION AND SOMETIMES SWELL ONE RIVER BANK AT THE EXPENSE OF ITS OPPOSITE NEIGHBOUR
6209-34600-0012 THE BOY WENT TO THE BRIDGE WHICH AT THAT PERIOD WAS A COVERED TIMBER STRUCTURE HE CROSSED IT
6209-34600-0014 HE HAD NO STRENGTH LEFT TO CALL OR SHOUT AT MELCOMBE REGIS AS AT WEYMOUTH NO ONE WAS STIRRING THE DOORS WERE ALL CAREFULLY DOUBLE LOCKED THE WINDOWS WERE COVERED BY THEIR SHUTTERS AS THE EYES BY THEIR LIDS
6209-34600-0015 ALL ITS LETHARGIES MINGLE THEIR NIGHTMARES ITS SLUMBERS ARE A CROWD AND FROM ITS HUMAN BODIES LYING PRONE THERE ARISES A VAPOUR OF DREAMS SLEEP HAS GLOOMY ASSOCIATES BEYOND THIS LIFE
6209-34600-0017 HENCE ARISE ENTANGLEMENTS DREAMS THOSE CLOUDS INTERPOSE THEIR FOLDS AND THEIR TRANSPARENCIES OVER THAT STAR THE MIND
6209-34600-0018 INTO IMPALPABILITY MYSTERIOUS DIFFUSED EXISTENCES AMALGAMATE THEMSELVES WITH LIFE ON THAT BORDER OF DEATH WHICH SLEEP IS THOSE LARVAE AND SOULS MINGLE IN THE AIR
6209-34600-0020 WENDING HIS WAY AMIDST THE SLEEP PHANTOMS OF OTHERS UNCONSCIOUSLY PUSHES BACK PASSING SHADOWS HAS OR IMAGINES THAT HE HAS A VAGUE FEAR OF ADVERSE CONTACT WITH THE INVISIBLE
6209-34600-0021 AND FEELS AT EVERY MOMENT THE OBSCURE PRESSURE OF A HOSTILE ENCOUNTER WHICH IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THERE IS SOMETHING OF THE EFFECT OF A FOREST IN THE NOCTURNAL DIFFUSION OF DREAMS THIS IS WHAT IS CALLED BEING AFRAID WITHOUT REASON
6209-34600-0023 WHICH HE TOOK FOR THE OCEAN HE NO LONGER KNEW IN WHAT DIRECTION THE SEA LAY HE RETRACED HIS STEPS STRUCK TO THE LEFT BY MAIDEN STREET AND RETURNED AS FAR AS SAINT ALBAN'S ROW
6209-34600-0024 THERE BY CHANCE AND WITHOUT SELECTION HE KNOCKED VIOLENTLY AT ANY HOUSE THAT HE HAPPENED TO PASS HIS BLOWS ON WHICH HE WAS EXPENDING HIS LAST ENERGIES WERE JERKY AND WITHOUT AIM NOW CEASING ALTOGETHER FOR A TIME
6209-34600-0026 THEY WERE JUST OVER A SOMEWHAT SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE PLAGUE IN LONDON AND THAT THE FEAR OF RECEIVING SICK VAGABONDS CAUSED A DIMINUTION OF HOSPITALITY EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WOULD NOT EVEN OPEN THEIR WINDOWS FOR FEAR OF INHALING THE POISON
6209-34600-0027 THE CHILD FELT THE COLDNESS OF MEN MORE TERRIBLY THAN THE COLDNESS OF NIGHT
6209-34600-0029 NOTHING IS SO FREEZING IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS AS THE VOICE OF THE HOUR IT IS A DECLARATION OF INDIFFERENCE IT IS ETERNITY SAYING WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME HE STOPPED
6209-34600-0030 TO LIE DOWN THERE AND DIE HOWEVER THE LITTLE INFANT LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST HIS SHOULDER AND FELL ASLEEP AGAIN THIS BLIND CONFIDENCE SET HIM ONWARDS AGAIN
6209-34600-0032 HE DID WHAT HE CHANCED TO DO HE SET OUT AGAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF JOHNSTONE ROW BUT NOW HE NO LONGER WALKED HE DRAGGED HIMSELF ALONG HE LEFT SAINT MARY'S STREET TO THE LEFT MADE ZIGZAGS THROUGH LANES
6209-34600-0033 HE PERCEIVED THE SEA TO THE RIGHT AND SCARCELY ANYTHING MORE OF THE TOWN TO HIS LEFT WHAT WAS TO BECOME OF HIM HERE WAS THE COUNTRY AGAIN TO THE EAST GREAT INCLINED PLANES OF SNOW MARKED OUT THE WIDE SLOPES OF RADIPOLE
6209-34600-0035 WHICH OF THE TWO REFUSALS SHOULD HE CHOOSE THERE IS THE ANCHOR OF MERCY THERE IS ALSO THE LOOK OF PITEOUSNESS IT WAS THAT LOOK WHICH THE POOR LITTLE DESPAIRING WANDERER THREW AROUND HIM
6209-34601-0000 MISANTHROPY PLAYS ITS PRANKS A STRANGE AND ALARMING GRINDING OF TEETH REACHED HIM THROUGH THE DARKNESS IT WAS ENOUGH TO DRIVE ONE BACK HE ADVANCED
6209-34601-0002 MADE BY THE REFLECTION OF SNOW AND SEA HE SAW A THING PLACED AS IF FOR SHELTER IT WAS A CART UNLESS IT WAS A HOVEL IT HAD WHEELS IT WAS A CARRIAGE IT HAD A ROOF IT WAS A DWELLING
6209-34601-0003 FROM THE ROOF AROSE A FUNNEL AND OUT OF THE FUNNEL SMOKE THIS SMOKE WAS RED AND SEEMED TO IMPLY A GOOD FIRE IN THE INTERIOR BEHIND PROJECTING HINGES INDICATED A DOOR
6209-34601-0005 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE WHEELS A HEAD WAS PUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6209-34601-0006 THE MOUTH WAS SILENT THE HEAD BEGAN AGAIN IS ANY ONE THERE THE CHILD ANSWERED YES WHO I YOU WHO ARE YOU WHENCE DO YOU COME
6209-34601-0008 THE CHILD BOWED HIS FOREHEAD DREW THE SLEEPING INFANT CLOSER IN HIS ARMS AND COLLECTED HIS STRENGTH TO RESUME HIS JOURNEY HE HAD TAKEN A FEW STEPS AND WAS HURRYING AWAY
6209-34601-0009 THE CHILD TURNED BACK
6209-34601-0011 YOU ARE TOLD TO COME IN YOU YOUNG RASCAL HE MADE UP HIS MIND AND PLACED ONE FOOT ON THE LOWEST STEP THERE WAS A GREAT GROWL UNDER THE VAN HE DREW BACK THE GAPING JAWS APPEARED
6209-34601-0012 CRIED THE VOICE OF THE MAN THE JAWS RETREATED THE GROWLING CEASED COME UP CONTINUED THE MAN THE CHILD WITH DIFFICULTY CLIMBED UP THE THREE STEPS HE WAS IMPEDED BY THE INFANT
6209-34601-0014 NO CANDLE WAS BURNING IN THE CARAVAN PROBABLY FROM THE ECONOMY OF WANT THE HUT WAS LIGHTED ONLY BY A RED TINGE ARISING FROM THE OPENING AT THE TOP OF THE STOVE IN WHICH SPARKLED A PEAT FIRE
6209-34601-0015 ON THE STOVE WERE SMOKING A PORRINGER AND A SAUCEPAN CONTAINING TO ALL APPEARANCE SOMETHING TO EAT THE SAVOURY ODOUR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE HUT WAS FURNISHED WITH A CHEST
6209-34601-0017 A VESSEL RATHER LIKE THOSE USED FOR GRAINING WAX WHICH ARE CALLED GRANULATORS AND A CONFUSION OF STRANGE OBJECTS OF WHICH THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WHICH WERE UTENSILS FOR COOKING AND CHEMISTRY THE CARAVAN WAS OBLONG IN SHAPE
6209-34601-0018 THE STOVE BEING IN FRONT IT WAS NOT EVEN A LITTLE ROOM IT WAS SCARCELY A BIG BOX THERE WAS MORE LIGHT OUTSIDE FROM THE SNOW THAN INSIDE FROM THE STOVE EVERYTHING IN THE CARAVAN WAS INDISTINCT AND MISTY
6209-34601-0020 THE ONE HE HAD JUST HEARD GROWLING THE OTHER SPEAKING THE CHILD HAVING REACHED THE THRESHOLD PERCEIVED NEAR THE STOVE A MAN TALL SMOOTH THIN AND OLD DRESSED IN GRAY WHOSE HEAD AS HE STOOD
6209-34601-0021 REACHED THE ROOF THE MAN COULD NOT HAVE RAISED HIMSELF ON TIPTOE THE CARAVAN WAS JUST HIS SIZE COME IN SAID THE MAN WHO WAS URSUS THE CHILD ENTERED PUT DOWN YOUR BUNDLE
6209-34601-0023 AND WITH FEVERISH HASTE HE DRAGGED OFF THE BOY'S RAGS WHICH TORE INTO SHREDS WITH THE OTHER HE TOOK DOWN FROM A NAIL A MAN'S SHIRT AND ONE OF THOSE KNITTED JACKETS WHICH ARE UP TO THIS DAY CALLED KISS ME QUICKS HERE ARE CLOTHES
6209-34601-0024 AND CHAFED BEFORE THE FIRE THE LIMBS OF THE EXHAUSTED AND BEWILDERED CHILD WHO AT THAT MOMENT WARM AND NAKED FELT AS IF HE WERE SEEING AND TOUCHING HEAVEN THE LIMBS HAVING BEEN RUBBED HE NEXT WIPED THE BOY'S FEET
6209-34601-0026 WHAT THE CHILD SAW IN THE PORRINGER WAS AGAIN HEAVEN TO HIM NAMELY A POTATO AND A BIT OF BACON YOU ARE HUNGRY
6209-34601-0027 THE MAN TOOK FROM THE SHELF A CRUST OF HARD BREAD AND AN IRON FORK AND HANDED THEM TO THE CHILD THE BOY HESITATED PERHAPS YOU EXPECT ME TO LAY THE CLOTH SAID THE MAN AND HE PLACED THE PORRINGER ON THE CHILD'S LAP
6209-34601-0029 YOU SHOULD SEE A LORD SUP IN MY TIME I HAVE SEEN DUKES EAT THEY DON'T EAT THAT'S NOBLE THEY DRINK HOWEVER COME YOU PIG STUFF YOURSELF THE ABSENCE OF EARS
6209-34601-0030 FOR THE MOMENT HE WAS ABSORBED BY TWO EXIGENCIES AND BY TWO ECSTASIES FOOD AND WARMTH URSUS CONTINUED HIS IMPRECATIONS MUTTERING TO HIMSELF
6209-34601-0032 BROWSES A WORD DERIVED FROM BRUTE WHAT PUT IT INTO MY HEAD TO COME TO THIS WEYMOUTH SEVEN TIMES DEVOTED TO THE INFERNAL DEITIES I HAVE SOLD NOTHING SINCE MORNING I HAVE HARANGUED THE SNOW
6209-34601-0033 I HAVE PLAYED THE FLUTE TO THE HURRICANE I HAVE NOT POCKETED A FARTHING AND NOW TO NIGHT BEGGARS DROP IN HORRID PLACE THERE IS

6209-34601-0038 ONE CRUST OF BREAD A MOUTHFUL OF BACON AND A DROP OF MILK AND I PUT IT TO WARM
6272-70168-0000 INSTEAD OF MY HEART LEAPING FOR JOY AS I HAD EXPECTED A SUDDEN INDIFFERENCE FILLED IT I FELT AVERSE TO THE CHANGE FROM THE NARROW WAYS OF BARMOUTH WHICH FOR THE MOMENT I REGRETTED
6272-70168-0002 I HEARD THE WONTED SOUND OF THE BANGING OF DOORS THE DOORS AT GRAND'THER'S I MUSED HAD LIST NAILED ROUND THEIR EDGES BUT THEN HE HAD THE LIST BEING A TAILOR I VUM SAID TEMPERANCE WITH HER HAND ON HER HIP
6272-70168-0003 AND NOT OFFERING TO APPROACH ME YOUR HAIR IS AS THICK AS A MOP HEPSEY RUBBING HER FINGERS AGAINST HER THUMB REMARKED THAT SHE HOPED LEARNING HAD NOT TAKEN AWAY MY APPETITE
6272-70168-0005 THE BOY BY NAME CHARLES CAME TO SEE THE NEW ARRIVAL BUT SMITTEN WITH DIFFIDENCE CREPT UNDER THE TABLE AND EXAMINED ME FROM HIS RETREAT
6272-70168-0006 INQUIRED MOTHER HE IS GETTING HIS DOUBLE TEETH OH YES AND WHERE'S VERONICA SHE'S UP GARRET WRITING GEOGRAPHY AND TOLD ME NOTHING IN THE WORLD MUST DISTURB HER TILL SHE HAD FINISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE CITY OF PALMIRY
6272-70168-0008 A TORRENT OF LOVE SWEPT THROUGH ME AND I KISSED HIM I AM AFRAID I MAKE AN IDOL OF HIM CASSY ARE YOU UNHAPPY BECAUSE YOU LOVE HIM SO WELL MOTHER AND FEEL THAT YOU MUST MAKE EXPIATION CASSANDRA SHE SPOKE WITH HASTE
6272-70168-0009 DID YOU EXPERIENCE ANY SHADOW OF A CHANGE DURING THE REVIVAL AT BARMOUTH NO MORE THAN THE BABY HERE DID I SHALL HAVE FAITH THOUGH
6272-70168-0011 MY HEARING HIM OR NOT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE SINCE GOD COULD HEAR AND ANSWER GRAND'THER DOES NOT LIKE ME I NEVER PLEASED HIM SHE LOOKED ASTONISHED THEN REFLECTIVE
6272-70168-0012 TEMPERANCE BROUGHT ARTHUR TO THE TABLE HALF ASLEEP BUT HE ROUSED WHEN SHE DRUMMED ON HIS PLATE WITH A SPOON HEPSEY WAS STATIONED BY THE BANNOCK KNIFE IN HAND TO SERVE IT AS WE BEGAN OUR MEAL
6272-70168-0014 HER FACE WAS STILL LONG AND NARROW BUT PRETTIER AND HER LARGE DARK EYES HAD A SLIGHT CAST WHICH GAVE HER FACE AN INDESCRIBABLE EXPRESSION DISTANT INDIFFERENT AND SPECULATIVE AS THE EYES WERE
6272-70168-0015 AND ATE IT IN SILENCE THE PLENTY AROUND ME THE EASE AND INDEPENDENCE GAVE ME A DELIGHTFUL SENSE OF COMFORT THE DISHES WERE ODD SOME OF CHINA SOME OF DELF AND WERE CONTINUALLY MOVED OUT OF THEIR PLACES FOR WE HELPED OURSELVES
6272-70168-0017 I GREW BLITHE AS I SAW IT WINKING UNDER THE RAYS OF THE AFTERNOON SUN AND CLAPPING MY HANDS SAID I WAS GLAD TO GET HOME WE LEFT VERONICA AT THE TABLE AND MOTHER RESUMED HER CONVERSATION WITH ME IN A CORNER OF THE ROOM
6272-70168-0018 PRESENTLY TEMPERANCE CAME IN WITH CHARLES BRINGING FRESH PLATES AS SOON AS THEY BEGAN THEIR SUPPER VERONICA ASKED TEMPERANCE HOW THE FISH TASTED IS IT SALT MIDDLING HOW IS THE BANNOCK EXCELLENT
6272-70168-0020 I FEEL EVIL STILL YOU KNOW TURNING TO ME THAT MY TEMPER IS WORSE THAN EVER IT IS LIKE A TIGER'S OH VERRY SAID MOTHER NOT QUITE SO BAD YOU ARE TOO HARD UPON YOURSELF
6272-70168-0021 SAY SO TO MY OWN CHILD VERRY TURNED HER FACE TO THE WALL AND SAID NO MORE BUT SHE HAD STARTED A LESS PLEASANT TRAIN OF THOUGHT IT WAS CHANGED AGAIN BY TEMPERANCE COMING WITH LIGHTS
6272-70168-0023 SO SHE SENT HIM OFF WITH TEMPERANCE AND CHARLES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO ROCK THE CRADLE AS LONG AS HIS BABYSHIP REQUIRED SOON AFTER FATHER CAME AND HEPSEY BROUGHT IN HIS HOT SUPPER WHILE HE WAS EATING IT GRANDFATHER JOHN MORGESON BUSTLED IN
6272-70168-0024 AS HE SHOOK HANDS WITH ME I SAW THAT HIS HAIR HAD WHITENED HE HELD A TASSELED CANE BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND THUMPED THE FLOOR WHENEVER HE ASKED A QUESTION
6272-70168-0026 HER HAIR DROPPED ON HER SHOULDER AND LOOKED LIKE A BROWN COILED SERPENT VERONICA WHO HAD BEEN SILENTLY OBSERVING HER ROSE FROM THE SOFA PICKED UP THE COMB AND FASTENED HER HAIR WITHOUT SPEAKING AS SHE PASSED SHE GAVE ME A DARK LOOK
6272-70168-0027 EH VERRY SAID FATHER ARE YOU THERE WERE YOU GLAD TO SEE CASSY HOME AGAIN SHOULD I BE GLAD WHAT CAN SHE DO GRANDFATHER PURSED UP HIS MOUTH
6272-70168-0029 AND DARTING OUT A MOMENT AFTER WE HEARD HER GRANDFATHER WENT AND PRESENTLY MISTER PARK GOT UP IN A LINGERING WAY
6272-70168-0030 JOE BACON MOTHER RETIRED VERRY STILL PLAYED HER TALENT IS WONDERFUL SAID FATHER TAKING THE CIGAR FROM HIS MOUTH BY THE WAY YOU MUST TAKE LESSONS IN MILFORD I WISH YOU WOULD LEARN TO SING
6272-70168-0032 A VERY STRONG RELATION OF RESERVE GENERALLY EXISTED BETWEEN PARENT AND CHILD INSTEAD OF A CONFIDENTIAL ONE AND THE CHILD WAS APT TO DISCOVER THAT RESERVE ON THE PART OF THE PARENT WAS NOT SUPERIORITY BUT COWARDICE OR INDIFFERENCE
6272-70168-0033 LET IT NOT BE SO WITH US WAS HIS CONCLUSION HE THREW AWAY THE STUMP OF HIS CIGAR AND WENT TO FASTEN THE HALL DOOR I TOOK ONE OF THE BRASS LAMPS PROPOSING TO GO TO BED
6272-70171-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IT WAS SUNSET WHEN WE ARRIVED IN ROSVILLE AND FOUND MISTER MORGESON WAITING FOR US WITH HIS CARRIAGE AT THE STATION FROM ITS OPEN SIDES
6272-70171-0001 I LOOKED OUT ON A TRANQUIL AGREEABLE LANDSCAPE THERE WAS NOTHING SALINE IN THE ATMOSPHERE THE WESTERN BREEZE WHICH BLEW IN OUR FACES HAD AN EARTHY SCENT WITH FLUCTUATING STREAMS OF ODORS FROM TREES AND FLOWERS
6272-70171-0003 ROSVILLE WAS LARGER AND HANDSOMER THAN SURREY THAT IS MY HOUSE ON THE RIGHT HE SAID WE LOOKED DOWN THE SHADY STREET THROUGH WHICH WE WERE GOING
6272-70171-0004 AND PEAKED ROOF AND ON THE SIDE TOWARD US A LARGE YARD AND STABLES WE DROVE INTO THE YARD AND A WOMAN CAME OUT ON THE PIAZZA TO RECEIVE US IT WAS MISSUS MORGESON OR MY WIFE COUSIN ALICE
6272-70171-0006 WE WERE HARDLY SEATED WHEN WE HEARD THE CRY OF A YOUNG CHILD SHE LEFT THE TABLE HASTILY TO COME BACK IN A MOMENT WITH AN APOLOGY WHICH SHE MADE TO COUSIN CHARLES RATHER THAN TO US I HAD NEVER SEEN A TABLE SO WELL ARRANGED
6272-70171-0007 SO FASTIDIOUSLY NEAT IT GLITTERED WITH GLASS AND FRENCH CHINA COUSIN CHARLES SENT AWAY A GLASS AND A PLATE FROWNING AT THE GIRL WHO WAITED THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A SPECK OR A FLAW IN THEM THE VIANDS WERE AS PRETTY AS THE DISHES
6272-70171-0009 I COULD HAVE SQUEEZED THE WHOLE OF IT INTO MY MOUTH STILL HUNGRY I OBSERVED THAT COUSIN CHARLES AND ALICE HAD FINISHED AND THOUGH SHE SHOOK HER SPOON IN THE CUP FEIGNING TO CONTINUE AND HE SNIPPED CRUMBS IN HIS PLATE
6272-70171-0010 I FELT CONSTRAINED TO END MY REPAST HE ROSE THEN AND PUSHING BACK FOLDING DOORS WE ENTERED A LARGE ROOM LEAVING ALICE AT THE TABLE WINDOWS EXTENDING TO THE FLOOR OPENING ON THE PIAZZA
6272-70171-0012 THE FURNITURE WAS DARK THE MANTEL AND TABLE TOPS WERE BLACK MARBLE AND THE VASES AND CANDELABRA WERE BRONZE HE DIRECTED MOTHER'S ATTENTION TO THE PORTRAITS OF HIS CHILDREN EXPLAINING THEM
6272-70171-0013 DARK AND DELICATE BUT TO LOOK AT IT MADE ME SHIVER MOTHER CAME TOWARD US PLEADING FATIGUE AS AN EXCUSE FOR RETIRING AND COUSIN CHARLES CALLED COUSIN ALICE WHO WENT WITH US TO OUR ROOM IN THE MORNING SHE SAID
6272-70171-0015 SHE COULD APPRECIATE HER ANXIETY AND SADNESS IN LEAVING ME MOTHER THANKED HER WARMLY AND WAS SURE THAT I SHOULD BE HAPPY BUT I HAD AN INWARD MISGIVING THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT I HEAR EDWARD SAID ALICE GOOD NIGHT
6272-70171-0016 PRESENTLY A GIRL THE SAME WHO HAD TAKEN OUR BONNETS CAME IN WITH A PITCHER OF WARM WATER AND A PLATE OF SODA BISCUIT SHE DIRECTED US WHERE TO FIND THE APPAREL SHE HAD NICELY SMOOTHED AND FOLDED TOOK OFF THE HANDSOME COUNTERPANE AND THE PILLOWS TRIMMED WITH LACE
6272-70171-0018 UNDRESSING MEANWHILE AND SURVEYING THE APARTMENT CASSY MISSUS MORGESON IS AN EXCELLENT HOUSEKEEPER YES I SAID HUSKILY FOR THE DRY BISCUIT CHOKED ME WHAT WOULD TEMPERANCE AND HEPSEY SAY TO THIS
6272-70171-0019 I THINK THEY WOULD GRUMBLE AND ADMIRE LOOK AT THIS SHOWING HER THE TASSELS OF THE INNER WINDOW CURTAINS DONE UP IN LITTLE BAGS AND THE GLASS IS PINNED UP WITH NICE YELLOW PAPER
6272-70171-0021 IT WAS BYRON AND TURNING OVER THE LEAVES TILL I CAME TO DON JUAN I READ IT THROUGH
6272-70171-0022 WHICH WAS NOT THE ONE WE HAD TAKEN TEA IN BUT A SMALL APARTMENT WITH A DOOR OPENING INTO THE GARDEN
6272-70171-0024 I DREW FROM HER CONVERSATION THE OPINION THAT SHE HAD A TENDENCY TO THE REARING OF CHILDREN I WAS GLAD WHEN COUSIN CHARLES CAME IN LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SEND OFF THE BABIES ALICE AND RING THE BELL FOR BREAKFAST SHE SENT OUT THE TWO YOUNGEST
6272-70171-0025 PUT LITTLE EDWARD IN HIS CHAIR AND BREAKFAST BEGAN MISSUS MORGESON SAID CHARLES THE HORSES WILL BE READY TO TAKE YOU ROUND ROSVILLE WE WILL CALL ON DOCTOR PRICE FOR YOU TO SEE THE KIND OF MASTER CASSANDRA WILL HAVE I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN TO HIM ABOUT RECEIVING A NEW PUPIL
6272-70171-0027 THE HAM WAS MOST SAVORY BUT CUT IN SUCH THIN SLICES THAT IT CURLED AND THE BISCUITS WERE AS WHITE AND FEATHERY AS SNOWFLAKES
6272-70171-0028 COUSIN ALICE GAVE UNREMITTING ATTENTION TO EDWARD WHO ATE AS LITTLE AS THE REST MOTHER I SAID AFTERWARD
6272-70171-0030 SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING UP SOME NICE DISH TELL HER I REMEMBER IT WILL YOU WHEN COUSIN CHARLES PUT US INTO THE CARRIAGE AND HOISTED LITTLE EDWARD ON THE FRONT SEAT MOTHER NOTICED THAT TWO MEN HELD THE HORSES AND THAT THEY WERE NOT THE SAME HE HAD DRIVEN THE NIGHT BEFORE
6272-70171-0031 SHE SAID SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO THEY LOOKED UNGOVERNABLE BUT HE REASSURED HER AND ONE OF THE MEN AVERRING THAT MISTER MORGESON COULD DRIVE ANYTHING SHE REPRESSED HER FEARS AND WE DROVE OUT OF THE YARD BEHIND A PAIR OF HORSES
6272-70171-0033 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME I SAW HIS FATHER SMILE ON HIM THESE ARE FINE BRUTES HE SAID NOT TAKING HIS EYES FROM THEM BUT THEY ARE NOT EQUAL TO MY MARE NELL ALICE IS AFRAID OF HER BUT I HOPE THAT YOU CASSANDRA
6272-70171-0034 LEAPING SO HIGH THAT THE HARNESS SEEMED RATTLING FROM THEIR BACKS HE STRUCK THEM AND SAID GO ON NOW GO ON DEVILS THERE WAS NO FURTHER TROUBLE HE ENCOURAGED MOTHER NOT TO BE AFRAID LOOKING KEENLY AT ME
6272-70171-0036 AS AN OLD COLLEGE FRIEND LOCKE MORGESON SOUNDED FAMILIARLY HE SAID A MEMBER OF HIS MOTHER'S FAMILY NAMED SOMERS HAD MARRIED A GENTLEMAN OF THAT NAME HE REMEMBERED IT FROM AN OLD IVORY MINIATURE WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD SHOWN HIM
6272-70171-0037 TELLING HIM IT WAS THE LIKENESS OF HER COUSIN RACHEL'S HUSBAND I REPLIED WE KNEW THAT GRANDFATHER HAD MARRIED A RACHEL SOMERS COUSIN CHARLES WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE VEXED THAT THE DOCTOR HAD NEVER TOLD HIM
6272-70171-0039 THAT I FRANKLY TOLD HER I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD VERY IGNORANT AND AVERSE FROM LEARNING BUT I DID NOT SPEAK LOUD ENOUGH FOR ANYBODY BESIDE HERSELF TO HEAR NOW SAID MOTHER WHEN WE CAME AWAY
6272-70171-0040 THINK HOW MUCH GREATER YOUR ADVANTAGES ARE THAN MINE HAVE EVER BEEN HOW MISERABLE WAS MY YOUTH IT IS TOO LATE FOR ME TO MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT CULTIVATION I HAVE NO WISH THAT WAY
6272-70191-0000 WE SAT IN STATE TO BE CONDOLED WITH AND WAITED UPON
6272-70191-0001 THOUGH I AM SURE THE PERFORMERS THEREOF HAD SMALL ENCOURAGEMENT VERONICA ALONE WOULD SEE NO ONE HER ROOM WAS THE ONLY ONE NOT INVADED FOR THE NEIGHBORS TOOK THE HOUSE INTO THEIR HANDS ASSISTED BY THAT PART OF THE MORGESONS
6272-70191-0003 HER COURSE WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED MINE WAS IMPOSED UPON ME I REMONSTRATED WITH TEMPERANCE BUT SHE REPLIED THAT IT WAS ALL WELL MEANT AND ALWAYS DONE
6272-70191-0004 I ENDURED THE SAME ANNOYANCES OVER AND OVER AGAIN FROM RELAYS OF PEOPLE BED TIME ESPECIALLY WAS THEIR OCCASION I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO UNDRESS ALONE I MUST HAVE DRINKS EITHER TO COMPOSE OR STIMULATE
6272-70191-0006 KEPT FROM MYSELF DURING THIS INTERVAL THE MATTER IS OFTEN SUBSERVIENT TO THE MANNER ARTHUR'S FEELINGS WERE PLAYED UPON ALSO HE WEPT OFTEN CONFIDING TO ME HIS GRIEF AND HIS PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
6272-70191-0007 THINGS WOULD GO WELL HE SAID FOR EVERYBODY MUST EXPECT TO DIE THEN THE BIBLE SAYS SO HE INFORMED ME ALSO THAT HE EXPECTED TO BE AN ARCHITECT AND THAT MOTHER LIKED IT HE HAD AN IDEA
6272-70191-0009 FOR MEALS WERE PREPARED AT ALL HOURS FOR COMERS AND GOERS TEMPERANCE TOLD ME THAT THE MILD AND INDIFFERENT MOURNERS WERE FOND OF GOOD VICTUALS AND SHE THOUGHT THEIR HEARTS WERE LIGHTER THAN THEIR STOMACHS WHEN THEY WENT AWAY
6272-70191-0010 BECAUSE HE LOOKED SO GRIEF STRUCK AUNT MERCE WAS ENGAGED WITH A DRESSMAKER AND WITH THE ORDERS FOR BONNETS AND VEILS SHE DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF THE MOURNING WITH THE MORGESONS I ACQUIESCED IN ALL HER ARRANGEMENTS
6272-70191-0012 FOR SHE HAD NEVER WORN OUT THE GARMENTS MADE FOR GRAND'THER WARREN SHE'S A BIGGER CHILD THAN EVER TEMPERANCE REMARKED AND MUST HAVE HER WAY
6272-70191-0013 COMING INTO MY ROOM DRESSED FOR THE FUNERAL NO
6272-70191-0015 IS THIS LIKE HER SHE ASKED SHOWING ME A DRAWING HOW COULD YOU HAVE DONE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TRIED IS IT LIKE YES THE IDEA
6272-70191-0016 BUT WHAT A PICTURE SHE HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE MOTHER'S SHADOWY FACE SERENELY LOOKED FROM A HIGH SMALL WINDOW SET IN CLOUDS LIKE THOSE WHICH GATHER OVER THE SUN WHEN IT DRAWS WATER
6272-70191-0018 KEEP IT BUT DON'T WORK ON IT ANY MORE AND I PUT IT AWAY SHE WAS WAN AND LANGUID BUT COLLECTED I SEE YOU ARE READY SOMEBODY MUST BURY THE DEAD GO
6272-70191-0019 WILL THE HOUSE BE EMPTY YES GOOD I CAN WALK THROUGH IT ONCE MORE THE DEAD MUST BE BURIED THAT IS CERTAIN BUT WHY SHOULD IT BE CERTAIN THAT I MUST BE THE ONE TO DO IT YOU THINK I CAN GO THROUGH WITH IT THEN
6272-70191-0021 I THINK WE MIGHT KISS EACH OTHER NOW SHE SAID I OPENED MY ARMS HOLDING HER AGAINST MY BREAST SO TIGHTLY THAT SHE DREW BACK BUT KISSED MY CHEEK GENTLY AND TOOK FROM HER POCKET
6272-70191-0022 A FLACON OF SALTS WHICH SHE FASTENED TO MY BELT BY ITS LITTLE CHAIN AND SAID AGAIN GO BUT RECALLING ME SAID
6272-70191-0024 PUT HER HAND ON AN EMPTY CHAIR BESIDE FATHER WHO SAT BY THE COFFIN THOSE PASSAGES IN THE BIBLE WHICH CONTAIN THE BEAUTIFULLY POETIC IMAGES RELATING TO THE GOING OF MAN TO HIS LONG HOME WERE READ AND TO MY EAR
6272-70191-0025 THEY SEEMED TO FALL ON THE COFFIN IN DULL STRIFE WITH ITS INMATE WHO MUTELY CONTRADICTED THEM A DISCOURSE FOLLOWED WHICH WAS CALCULATED TO HARROW THE FEELINGS TO THE UTMOST ARTHUR BEGAN TO CRY SO NERVOUSLY
6272-70191-0027 AND ANXIOUS TO ESCAPE THE UNPROFITABLE TRIAL AS THE COFFIN WAS TAKEN OUT TO THE HEARSE MY HEART TWISTED AND PALPITATED AS IF A COMMAND HAD BEEN LAID UPON IT TO FOLLOW AND NOT LEAVE HER
6272-70191-0028 WHEN THE HEARSE MOVED DOWN THE STREET FATHER ARTHUR AND I WERE CALLED AND ASSISTED IN OUR OWN CHAISE AS IF WE WERE HELPLESS THE REINS WERE PUT IN FATHER'S HANDS AND THE HORSE WAS LED BEHIND THE HEARSE
6272-70191-0030 THE GRAVEYARD WAS A MILE OUTSIDE THE VILLAGE A SANDY PLAIN WHERE A FEW STUNTED PINES TRANSPLANTED FROM THE WOODS NEAR IT STRUGGLED TO KEEP ALIVE AS WE TURNED FROM THE STREET INTO THE LANE WHICH LED TO IT
6272-70191-0031 AND RODE UP A LITTLE HILL WHERE THE SAND WAS SO DEEP THAT IT MUFFLED THE WHEELS AND FEET OF THE HORSES THE WHOLE ROUND OF THE GRAY SKY WAS VISIBLE IT HUNG LOW OVER US I WISHED IT TO DROP AND BLOT OUT THE VAGUE NOTHINGS UNDER IT
6272-70191-0033 SLANTING BACKWARD AND FORWARD IN PROTEST AGAINST THE FOLLY OF INDICATING WHAT WAS NO LONGER BENEATH THEM THE MOUNDS WERE COVERED WITH MATS OF SCANTY TANGLED GRASS WITH HERE AND THERE A RANK SPOT OF GREEN
6272-70191-0034 IT WAS THE CUSTOM AND FATHER TOOK HIS HAT OFF TO THANK HIS FRIENDS FOR THEIR SYMPATHY AND ATTENTION HIS LIPS MOVED BUT NO WORDS WERE AUDIBLE THE PROCESSION MOVED DOWN THE PATH AGAIN
6272-70191-0036 BUT NOT A SOUL WAS THERE WHEN WE WENT IN THE DUTIES OF FRIENDSHIP AND TRADITION HAD BEEN FULFILLED THE NEIGHBORS HAD GONE HOME TO THEIR AVOCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC THE TRAGEDY WAS OVER ALL SPECULATION ON THE DEGREE OF OUR GRIEF
6272-70191-0037 OR OUR INDIFFERENCE WAS SETTLED WE COULD TAKE OFF OUR MOURNING GARMENTS AND OUR MOURNING COUNTENANCE NOW THAT WE WERE ALONE OR WE COULD GIVE WAY TO THAT ANGUISH WE ARE AFRAID AND ASHAMED TO SHOW EXCEPT BEFORE THE ONE
6367-65536-0001 IT HAD BEEN BY THESE FIRS HE HAD HALTED TWENTY YEARS AGO TURNING FOR ONE LAST GLANCE AT THE VALLEY BELOW THE HOME VALLEY WHICH HE HAD NEVER SEEN SINCE BUT THEN
6367-65536-0002 THE FIRS HAD BEEN LITTLE MORE THAN VIGOROUS YOUNG SAPLINGS THEY WERE TALL GNARLED TREES NOW WITH LICHENED TRUNKS AND THEIR LOWER BOUGHS WERE DEAD BUT HIGH UP THEIR TOPS WERE GREEN AND CAUGHT THE SAFFRON LIGHT OF THE WEST
6367-65536-0004 THE EARTH OLD TUNE WITH THE POWER TO CARRY THE SOUL BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME THE YEARS FELL AWAY FROM HIM AND HE FORGOT MUCH REMEMBERING MORE
6367-65536-0005 HE HAD CALLED THAT LONGING BY OTHER NAMES BUT HE KNEW IT NOW FOR WHAT IT WAS WHEN HEARING HE WAS SATISFIED HE WAS A TALL MAN WITH IRON GREY HAIR AND THE FACE OF A CONQUEROR STRONG
6367-65536-0007 A FACE THAT HID MUCH AND REVEALED LITTLE IT TOLD OF POWER AND INTELLECT BUT THE SOUL OF THE MAN WAS A HIDDEN THING
6367-65536-0008 NOT IN THE ARENA WHERE HE HAD FOUGHT AND TRIUMPHED GIVING FIERCE BLOW FOR BLOW WAS IT TO BE SHOWN BUT HERE LOOKING DOWN ON THE HOMELAND WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE HILLS ABOUT HIM IT ROSE DOMINANTLY AND CLAIMED ITS OWN
6367-65536-0010 THE PITTING OF STRENGTH AND CRAFT AGAINST STRENGTH AND CRAFT THE TIRELESS STRUGGLE THE EXULTATION OF VICTORY THEN SUDDENLY THEY HAD FAILED THEIR WORSHIPPER THEY CEASED TO SATISFY
6367-65536-0011 THE SACRIFICES HE HAD HEAPED ON THEIR ALTARS AVAILED HIM NOTHING IN THIS NEW NEED AND HUNGER OF HIS BEING HIS GODS MOCKED HIM AND HE WEARIED OF THEIR SERVICE WERE THERE NOT BETTER THINGS THAN THESE
6367-65536-0013 THE EARNESTNESS OF WELL FILLED PURPOSEFUL HOURS OF LABOUR THE SATISFACTION OF A GOOD DAY WORTHILY LIVED AT EVENTIDE THE UNBROKEN REST OF LONG STARRY NIGHTS WHERE MIGHT HE FIND THEM AGAIN
6367-65536-0014 WERE THEY YET TO BE HAD FOR THE SEEKING IN THE OLD VALLEY WITH THE THOUGHT CAME A GREAT YEARNING FOR HOME HE HAD HAD MANY HABITATIONS BUT HE REALIZED NOW THAT HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ANY OF THESE PLACES AS HOME
6367-65536-0016 BUT AT THE LAST HE FELT AFRAID THERE HAD BEEN MANY CHANGES OF THAT HE FELT SURE WOULD IT STILL BE HOME AND IF NOT WOULD NOT THE LOSS BE MOST IRREPARABLE AND BITTER
6367-65536-0017 WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER TO GO AWAY HAVING LOOKED AT IT FROM THE HILL AND HAVING HEARD THE SAGA OF THE FIRS KEEPING HIS MEMORY OF IT UNBLURRED THAN RISK THE PROBABLE DISILLUSION OF A RETURN TO THE PLACES THAT HAD FORGOTTEN HIM
6367-65536-0019 FOOLISH BECAUSE THE OBJECT OF HIS QUEST WAS NOT TO BE FOUND THERE OR ELSEWHERE HE COULD NOT ENTER AGAIN INTO THE HERITAGE OF BOYHOOD AND THE HEART OF YOUTH HE COULD NOT FIND THERE THE OLD DREAMS AND HOPES THAT HAD MADE LIFE SWEET
6367-65536-0020 HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE COULD NOT BRING BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY WHAT HE HAD TAKEN FROM IT HE HAD LOST THAT INTANGIBLE ALL REAL WEALTH OF FAITH AND IDEALISM AND ZEST
6367-65536-0022 THERE WAS NO ONE LEFT THERE UNCHANGED AND UNCHANGING TO WELCOME HIM HE WOULD BE A STRANGER THERE EVEN AMONG HIS KIN HE WOULD STAY AWHILE ON THE HILL UNTIL THE NIGHT CAME DOWN OVER IT
6367-65536-0023 AND THEN HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE DOWN BELOW HIM ON THE CREST OF A LITTLE UPLAND HE SAW HIS OLD HOME A WEATHER GREY HOUSE ALMOST HIDDEN AMONG WHITE BIRCH AND APPLE TREES
6367-65536-0025 WITH A SMILE SHE HAD MADE ANSWER MANY THINGS LADDIE WONDERFUL THINGS BEAUTIFUL THINGS HEART BREAKING THINGS SOME DAY I SHALL GO OVER THE HILLS AND FIND THEM ALL MOTHER
6367-65536-0026 HE HAD SAID STOUTLY SHE HAD LAUGHED AND SIGHED AND CAUGHT HIM TO HER HEART HE HAD NO RECOLLECTION OF HIS FATHER WHO HAD DIED SOON AFTER HIS SON'S BIRTH BUT HOW WELL HE REMEMBERED HIS MOTHER
6367-65536-0028 HE WANTED TO GO BEYOND THE HILLS AND SEEK WHAT HE KNEW MUST BE THERE THE VALLEY WAS TOO NARROW TOO PLACID HE LONGED FOR CONFLICT AND ACCOMPLISHMENT
6367-65536-0029 HE SOLD THE FARM TO HIS COUSIN STEPHEN MARSHALL HE SUPPOSED IT STILL BELONGED TO HIM STEPHEN HAD BEEN A GOOD SORT OF A FELLOW A BIT SLOW AND PLODDING PERHAPS BOVINELY CONTENT TO DWELL WITHIN THE HILLS
6367-65536-0031 THE CHILDLESS WIFELESS MAN LOOKING DOWN FROM THE HILL WONDERED IF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SO WITH HIM HAD HE BEEN CONTENT TO STAY IN THE VALLEY PERHAPS SO THERE HAD BEEN JOYCE
6367-65536-0032 NOT SO FAR FROM HIS OWN JUST ACROSS A GREEN MEADOW BY WAY OF A FOOTPATH AND STILE AND THROUGH THE FIRS BEYOND IT HOW OFTEN HE HAD TRAVERSED THAT PATH IN THE OLD DAYS KNOWING THAT JOYCE WOULD BE WAITING AT THE END OF IT AMONG THE FIRS
6367-65536-0034 JOYCE ALONE KNEW OF HIS LONGINGS AND HIS AMBITIONS AND HIS DREAMS HE HAD TOLD THEM ALL TO HER FREELY SURE OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND SYMPATHY NO OTHER SOUL IN THE VALLEY COULD GIVE HIM
6367-65536-0035 HOW TRUE AND STRONG AND WOMANLY AND GENTLE SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN WHEN HE LEFT HOME HE HAD MEANT TO GO BACK TO HER SOME DAY THEY HAD PARTED WITHOUT PLEDGE OR KISS YET HE KNEW SHE LOVED HIM AND THAT HE LOVED HER
6367-65536-0037 BOYHOOD'S LOVE WAS SCORCHED UP IN THAT HOT FLAME OF AMBITION AND CONTEST HE HAD NOT HEARD FROM OR OF JOYCE FOR MANY YEARS NOW AGAIN HE REMEMBERED AS HE LOOKED DOWN ON THE HOMELAND FIELDS
6367-65536-0038 THE OLD PLACES HAD CHANGED LITTLE WHATEVER HE MIGHT FEAR OF THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THEM THERE WAS THE SCHOOL HE HAD ATTENDED A SMALL LOW EAVED WHITE WASHED BUILDING SET BACK FROM THE MAIN ROAD AMONG GREEN SPRUCES
6367-65536-0040 OFFENSIVELY SPICK AND SPAN AND MODERN FOR THIS CHURCH HAD BEEN OLD WHEN HE WAS A BOY HE RECALLED THE MANY TIMES HE HAD WALKED TO IT ON THE PEACEFUL SUNDAY AFTERNOONS SOMETIMES WITH HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES WITH JOYCE
6367-65536-0041 THE SUN SET FAR OUT TO SEA AND SUCKED DOWN WITH IT ALL THE LIGHT OUT OF THE WINNOWED DOME OF SKY THE STARS CAME OUT SINGLY AND CRYSTAL CLEAR OVER THE FAR PURPLE CURVES OF THE HILLS
6367-65536-0043 REMEMBERING THAT IN BOYHOOD IT HAD BEEN HELD A GOOD OMEN TO SEE THE NEW MOON OVER THE RIGHT SHOULDER DOWN IN THE VALLEY THE LIGHTS BEGAN TO TWINKLE OUT HERE AND THERE LIKE EARTH STARS
6367-65536-0044 HE WOULD WAIT UNTIL HE SAW THE KITCHEN LIGHT FROM THE WINDOW OF HIS OLD HOME THEN HE WOULD GO
6367-65536-0046 HE FELT ANXIOUS AND DISSATISFIED AS IF HE COULD NOT GO AWAY UNTIL HE HAD SEEN IT WHEN IT WAS QUITE DARK HE DESCENDED THE HILL RESOLUTELY HE MUST KNOW WHY THE HOMELIGHT HAD FAILED HIM
6367-65536-0047 EVEN IN THE DIMNESS OF THE SUMMER NIGHT TO SEE THAT THE OLD HOUSE WAS DESERTED AND FALLING TO DECAY THE KITCHEN DOOR SWUNG OPEN ON RUSTY HINGES THE WINDOWS WERE BROKEN AND LIFELESS
6367-65536-0049 STEPHEN CAME TO IT A STOUT GRIZZLED FARMER WITH A CHUBBY BOY ON HIS SHOULDER HE WAS NOT MUCH CHANGED CUTHBERT EASILY RECOGNIZED HIM
6367-65536-0050 CUTHBERT WAS OBLIGED TO TELL WHO HE WAS HE WAS MADE INSTANTLY AND WARMLY WELCOME STEPHEN WAS UNFEIGNEDLY GLAD TO SEE HIM AND STEPHEN'S COMELY WIFE WHOM HE REMEMBERED AS A SLIM FRESH CHEEKED VALLEY GIRL
6367-65536-0052 THIS VALLEY HAD HIS PAST IN ITS KEEPING BUT IT COULD NOT GIVE IT BACK TO HIM HE HAD LOST THE MASTER WORD THAT MIGHT HAVE COMPELLED IT HE ASKED STEPHEN FULLY ABOUT ALL HIS OLD FRIENDS AND NEIGHBOURS WITH ONE EXCEPTION
6367-65536-0053 BY THE OLD FOOTPATH WHICH WAS STILL KEPT OPEN HE WALKED SLOWLY AND DREAMILY WITH HIS EYES ON THE FAR HILLS SCARFED IN THE SPLENDOUR OF SUNSET SO HE HAD WALKED IN THE OLD DAYS BUT HE HAD NO DREAMS NOW OF WHAT LAY BEYOND THE HILLS
6367-65536-0055 AND THE SOUL OF HER LOOKED OUT THROUGH THEM TRUE TO ITSELF THE STAUNCH BRAVE SWEET SOUL OF THE MAIDEN RIPENED TO WOMANHOOD JOYCE HE SAID STUPIDLY UNBELIEVINGLY
6367-65536-0056 BUT HE TOOK BOTH AND HELD HER SO LOOKING HUNGRILY DOWN AT HER AS A MAN LOOKS AT SOMETHING HE KNOWS MUST BE HIS SALVATION IF SALVATION EXISTS FOR HIM IS IT POSSIBLE YOU ARE HERE STILL JOYCE
6367-65536-0058 THE TWILIGHT IS SO KIND IT HIDES THAT BUT IT IS TRUE COME INTO THE HOUSE CUTHBERT FATHER AND MOTHER WILL BE GLAD TO SEE YOU AFTER A LITTLE HE SAID IMPLORINGLY LET US STAY HERE AWHILE FIRST JOYCE
6367-65536-0059 LAST NIGHT I STOOD ON THOSE HILLS YONDER AND LOOKED DOWN BUT I MEANT TO GO AWAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE NO ONE LEFT TO WELCOME ME IF I HAD KNOWN YOU WERE HERE YOU HAVE LIVED HERE IN THE OLD VALLEY ALL THESE YEARS
6367-65536-0061 IN TIME BUT SOMETIMES THE LESSON IS LEARNED TOO LATE SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I HAVE LEARNED JOYCE THE GIST OF THE LESSON IS THAT I LEFT HAPPINESS BEHIND ME IN THE OLD VALLEY WHEN I WENT AWAY FROM IT HAPPINESS AND PEACE AND THE JOY OF LIVING
6367-65536-0062 I DID NOT MISS THESE THINGS FOR A LONG WHILE I DID NOT EVEN KNOW I HAD LOST THEM BUT I HAVE DISCOVERED MY LOSS YET YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAN SHE SAID WONDERINGLY
6367-65536-0064 THEY DO NOT SATISFY THE MAN'S SOUL I HAVE COME BACK TO THE OLD VALLEY SEEKING FOR WHAT MIGHT SATISFY BUT I HAVE LITTLE HOPE OF FINDING IT UNLESS UNLESS HE WAS SILENT
6367-65536-0065 REMEMBERING THAT HE HAD FORFEITED ALL RIGHT TO HER HELP IN THE QUEST YET HE REALIZED CLEARLY THAT ONLY SHE COULD HELP HIM ONLY SHE COULD GUIDE HIM BACK TO THE PATH HE HAD MISSED IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT SHE HELD IN HER KEEPING
6367-65536-0067 THEY WALKED AMONG THE FIRS UNTIL THE STARS CAME OUT AND THEY TALKED OF MANY THINGS SHE HAD KEPT HER FRESHNESS OF SOUL AND HER IDEALS UNTARNISHED IN THE PEACE OF THE OLD VALLEY SHE HAD LIVED A LIFE NARROW OUTWARDLY
6367-65536-0068 WONDROUSLY DEEP AND WIDE IN THOUGHT AND ASPIRATION HER NATIVE HILLS BOUNDED THE VISION OF HER EYES BUT THE OUTLOOK OF THE SOUL WAS FAR AND UNHINDERED
6367-65536-0070 LIFE EVEN IN THE GLARE AND TUMULT OF THAT WORLD BEYOND THE HILLS WOULD NEVER HAVE LOST ITS MEANING FOR HIM OH FOOL AND BLIND THAT HE HAD BEEN WHILE HE HAD SOUGHT AND TOILED AFAR
6367-65536-0071 THE BEST THAT GOD HAD MEANT FOR HIM HAD BEEN HERE IN THE HOME OF YOUTH WHEN DARKNESS CAME DOWN THROUGH THE FIRS HE TOLD HER ALL THIS HALTINGLY BLUNDERINGLY YEARNINGLY JOYCE
6367-65536-0073 AND HE SAW THE REFLECTION OF A STAR IN HER EYES I HAVE NEVER CEASED TO CARE SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE I NEVER REALLY WANTED TO CEASE IT WOULD HAVE LEFT LIFE TOO EMPTY IF MY LOVE MEANS SO MUCH TO YOU
6367-65536-0074 IT IS YOURS CUTHBERT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN YOURS HE DREW HER CLOSE INTO HIS ARMS AND AS HE FELT HER HEART BEATING AGAINST HIS HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD FOUND THE WAY BACK TO SIMPLE HAPPINESS AND TRUE WISDOM
6367-74004-0001 HE IS PRINCIPAL OF THE FRAMPTON ACADEMY THE OLD FELLOW NOT RUGGLES AND HIS NAME IS GEORGE OSBORNE WE HAVE TO CALL HIM MISTER OSBORNE TO HIS FACE BUT HE IS THE OLD FELLOW EVERYWHERE ELSE
6367-74004-0002 BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE POINT THEY LIKE HIM TOO I HEARD EMMA WHITE SAY ONCE THAT HE WAS SO HANDSOME I NEARLY WHOOPED RUGGLES WAS MAD BECAUSE HE'S GONE ON EM
6367-74004-0004 THERE WAS A RUMOUR RUNNING AT LARGE IN THE ACADEMY THAT THE OLD FELLOW WROTE POETRY BUT HE RAN THE MATHEMATICS AND DIDN'T MAKE SUCH A FOOZLE OF IT AS YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE EITHER
6367-74004-0005 AT LEAST WE SAID SO BUT IF PROVIDENCE HADN'T SENT SYLVIA GRANT WALKING DOWN THE STREET PAST OUR BOARDING HOUSE THAT AFTERNOON WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE COOLED OFF BEFORE WE THOUGHT OF ANY WORKING PLAN OF REVENGE SYLVIA GRANT DID GO DOWN THE STREET HOWEVER
6367-74004-0007 MY PRIVATE OPINION IS THAT SYLVIA HADN'T ANY OR SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE PREFERRED BUT THERE I'M GETTING ON TOO FAST AGAIN RUGGLES SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN THIS STORY HE CAN CONCENTRATE BETTER SYLVIA WAS THE LATIN PROFESSOR'S DAUGHTER
6367-74004-0008 SHE WASN'T A CAD GIRL OF COURSE SHE WAS OVER TWENTY AND HAD GRADUATED FROM IT TWO YEARS AGO BUT SHE WAS IN ALL THE SOCIAL THINGS THAT WENT ON IN THE ACADEMY AND ALL THE UNMARRIED PROFESSORS EXCEPT THE OLD FELLOW WERE IN LOVE WITH HER
6367-74004-0010 THEY WERE BROWNISH KIND OF AND SHE'D A SPANKING HAT ON WITH FEATHERS AND THINGS IN IT HER HAIR WAS SHINING UNDER IT ALL PURPLY BLACK AND SHE LOOKED SWEET ENOUGH TO EAT
6367-74004-0011 AND HER BIG BLACKISH BLUE EYES SPARKLED BUT SHE HADN'T BEEN LAUGHING BEFORE OR SPARKLING EITHER
6367-74004-0013 BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE
6367-74004-0014 HE CAUGHT SYLVIA DOING THE SAME THING SO HE WHEELED AND CAME ON LOOKING MIGHTY FOOLISH AS HE PASSED BENEATH OUR WINDOW RUGGLES CHUCKLED FIENDISHLY I'VE THOUGHT OF SOMETHING POLLY HE SAID MY NAME IS PAUL
6367-74004-0016 YOU'LL HAVE TO RUGGLES YOU'VE HAD MORE PRACTICE RUGGLES TURNED RED I KNOW HE WRITES TO EM WHITE IN VACATIONS I'LL DO MY BEST HE SAID QUITE MEEKLY THAT IS I'LL COMPOSE IT BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COPY IT
6367-74004-0017 YOU CAN IMITATE THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING SO WELL BUT LOOK HERE I SAID AN UNCOMFORTABLE IDEA STRIKING ME WHAT ABOUT SYLVIA WON'T SHE FEEL KIND OF FLATTISH WHEN SHE FINDS OUT HE DIDN'T WRITE IT FOR OF COURSE HE'LL TELL HER
6367-74004-0019 BUT I KNOW A FEW LITTLE THINGS AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT RUGGLES COULDN'T HAVE MADE UP THAT LETTER ANY MORE THAN HE COULD HAVE WRITTEN A SONNET I TOLD HIM SO AND MADE HIM OWN UP HE HAD A COPY OF AN OLD LETTER THAT HAD BEEN WRITTEN TO HIS SISTER BY HER YOUNG MAN
6367-74004-0020 ANYHOW THAT LETTER JUST FILLED THE BILL IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY EXPRESSED RUGGLES'S SISTER'S YOUNG MAN MUST HAVE POSSESSED LOTS OF ABILITY HE WAS AN ENGLISH PROFESSOR SOMETHING LIKE MICKY
6367-74004-0022 AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY
6367-74004-0023 GEORGE OSBORNE THEN WE MAILED IT THAT VERY EVENING
6367-74004-0025 AND AVOIDED POOR MICKY SO SKILFULLY THAT IT WAS REALLY A PLEASURE TO WATCH HER THE OLD FELLOW CAME IN LATE WITH HIS TIE ALL CROOKED AS IT ALWAYS WAS I SAW SYLVIA BLUSH AND NUDGED RUGGLES TO LOOK SHE'S THINKING OF THE LETTER HE SAID
6367-74004-0026 RUGGLES AND I NEVER MEANT TO LISTEN UPON MY WORD WE DIDN'T IT WAS PURE ACCIDENT WE WERE IN BEHIND THE FLAGS AND PALMS IN THE MODERN LANGUAGES ROOM FIXING UP A PLAN HOW TO GET EM AND JENNIE OFF FOR A MOONLIT STROLL IN THE GROUNDS
6367-74004-0028 OR SAID MY LETTER OR SHOWN SURPRISE IN SOME WAY
6367-74004-0029 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT SYLVIA FOR A MOMENT AND THEN HE SAID KIND OF DRILY AH DID YOU YES SAID SYLVIA NOT MUCH ABOVE A WHISPER IT IT SURPRISED ME VERY MUCH I NEVER SUPPOSED THAT YOU
6367-74004-0031 YOU NEVER SAW SUCH A TRANSFORMATION AS CAME OVER THE OLD FELLOW HIS EYES JUST BLAZED BUT HIS FACE WENT WHITE HE BENT FORWARD AND TOOK HER HAND SYLVIA
6367-74004-0032 DO YOU MEAN THAT YOU YOU ACTUALLY CARE A LITTLE FOR ME DEAREST OH SYLVIA DO YOU MEAN THAT OF COURSE I DO SAID SYLVIA RIGHT OUT
6367-74004-0034 I THOUGHT IT QUITE USELESS TO TELL YOU OF MY LOVE BEFORE WILL YOU CAN YOU BE MY WIFE DARLING AT THIS POINT RUGGLES AND I DIFFER AS TO WHAT CAME NEXT
6367-74004-0035 HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
6367-74004-0037 RUGGLES AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING ON EARTH TO BE OUT OF THAT WE KNEW WE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE AND WE FELT AS FOOLISH AS FLATFISH IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN THE OLD FELLOW AND SYLVIA GOT UP AT LAST AND TRAILED AWAY BOTH OF THEM LOOKING IDIOTICALLY HAPPY
6385-34655-0000 THE RESEMBLANCE OF A PALACE TO A WOOD IN PALACES AFTER THE ITALIAN FASHION AND CORLEONE LODGE WAS ONE THERE WERE VERY FEW DOORS BUT ABUNDANCE OF TAPESTRY SCREENS AND CURTAINED DOORWAYS
6385-34655-0002 EASTERN SILKS NOOKS AND CORNERS SOME SECRET AND DARK AS NIGHT OTHERS LIGHT AND PLEASANT AS THE DAY THERE WERE ATTICS RICHLY AND BRIGHTLY FURNISHED BURNISHED RECESSES SHINING WITH DUTCH TILES AND PORTUGUESE AZULEJOS
6385-34655-0003 THE TOPS OF THE HIGH WINDOWS WERE CONVERTED INTO SMALL ROOMS AND GLASS ATTICS FORMING PRETTY HABITABLE LANTERNS THE THICKNESS OF THE WALLS WAS SUCH THAT THERE WERE ROOMS WITHIN THEM HERE AND THERE WERE CLOSETS
6385-34655-0005 OR THE CRIES OF LITTLE GIRLS BROUGHT THITHER BY LEBEL SMOTHERED SUCH PLACES WERE CONVENIENT FOR THE PURPOSE THEY WERE LABYRINTHINE CHAMBERS IMPRACTICABLE TO A STRANGER SCENES OF ABDUCTIONS UNKNOWN DEPTHS
6385-34655-0006 RECEPTACLES OF MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCES IN THOSE ELEGANT CAVERNS PRINCES AND LORDS STORED THEIR PLUNDER IN SUCH A PLACE THE COUNT DE CHAROLAIS HID MADAME COURCHAMP THE WIFE OF THE CLERK OF THE PRIVY COUNCIL
6385-34655-0008 ONCE IN AN OCCUPANT REMAINED THERE TILL THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE DECREED HIS OR HER RELEASE THEY WERE GILDED OUBLIETTES SAVOURING BOTH OF THE CLOISTER AND THE HAREM THEIR STAIRCASES TWISTED TURNED
6385-34655-0009 LED BACK TO THE STARTING POINT
6385-34655-0011 TURNING ON FALSE PANELS WERE EXITS AND ENTRANCES THEY WERE FULL OF STAGE CONTRIVANCES AND NO WONDER CONSIDERING THE DRAMAS THAT WERE PLAYED THERE THE FLOORS OF THESE HIVES REACHED FROM THE CELLARS TO THE ATTICS
6385-34655-0012 FROM VERSAILLES DOWNWARDS LIKE CELLS OF PYGMIES IN DWELLING PLACES OF TITANS PASSAGES NICHES ALCOVES AND SECRET RECESSES
6385-34655-0014 THE BRUTAL KNIGHTS OF ELTZ OF RIZZIO OF MONALDESCHI OF NAKED SWORDS PURSUING THE FUGITIVE FLYING FROM ROOM TO ROOM THE ANCIENTS TOO HAD MYSTERIOUS RETREATS OF THE SAME KIND IN WHICH LUXURY WAS ADAPTED TO ENORMITIES
6385-34655-0015 THE MAZE OF PASSAGES AND ALCOVES WITH SECRET AND BEWILDERING DOORS CHECKED AND RETARDED HIS PROGRESS HE STROVE TO RUN HE WAS OBLIGED TO WANDER HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BUT ONE DOOR TO THRUST OPEN WHILE HE HAD A SKEIN OF DOORS TO UNRAVEL
6385-34655-0017 AT TIMES HE THOUGHT THAT HE MUST BE RETURNING TOWARDS HIS STARTING POINT THEN THAT HE SAW SOME ONE APPROACHING IT WAS NO ONE IT WAS ONLY THE REFLECTION OF HIMSELF IN A MIRROR DRESSED AS A NOBLEMAN THAT HE IMPOSSIBLE
6385-34655-0018 THEN HE RECOGNIZED HIMSELF BUT NOT AT ONCE HE EXPLORED EVERY PASSAGE THAT HE CAME TO HE EXAMINED THE QUAINT ARRANGEMENTS OF THE RAMBLING BUILDING AND THEIR YET QUAINTER FITTINGS HERE A CABINET
6385-34655-0020 ONE OF THOSE PRETTY FLORENTINE RETREATS ADAPTED TO THE HYPOCHONDRIASIS OF WOMEN AND EVEN THEN CALLED BOUDOIRS EVERYWHERE ON THE CEILINGS ON THE WALLS AND ON THE VERY FLOORS WERE REPRESENTATIONS
6385-34655-0021 IN VELVET OR IN METAL OF BIRDS OF TREES OF LUXURIANT VEGETATION PICKED OUT IN RELIEFS OF LACEWORK TABLES COVERED WITH JET CARVINGS
6385-34655-0023 IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO GUESS WHETHER THOSE MANY SIDED SHINING SURFACES WHERE EMERALD GREEN MINGLED WITH THE GOLDEN HUES OF THE RISING SUN WHERE FLOATED A GLIMMER OF EVER VARYING COLOURS LIKE THOSE ON A PIGEON'S NECK WERE MINIATURE MIRRORS OR ENORMOUS BERYLS
6385-34655-0024 EVERYWHERE WAS MAGNIFICENCE AT ONCE REFINED AND STUPENDOUS IF IT WAS NOT THE MOST DIMINUTIVE OF PALACES IT WAS THE MOST GIGANTIC OF JEWEL CASES A HOUSE FOR MAB OR A JEWEL FOR GEO
6385-34655-0026 THIS WAS A LABYRINTH AT EACH STEP HE WAS STOPPED BY SOME MAGNIFICENT OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO RETARD HIS EXIT AND TO BE UNWILLING TO LET HIM PASS HE WAS ENCOMPASSED BY A NET OF WONDERS HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AND HELD BACK
6385-34655-0027 WHAT A HORRIBLE PALACE HE THOUGHT RESTLESS HE WANDERED THROUGH THE MAZE ASKING HIMSELF WHAT IT ALL MEANT
6385-34655-0029 IT REALIZED THE FABLES OF ENCHANTED CASTLES HIDDEN PIPES OF HOT AIR MAINTAINED A SUMMER TEMPERATURE IN THE BUILDING IT WAS AS IF SOME MAGICIAN HAD CAUGHT UP THE MONTH OF JUNE AND IMPRISONED IT IN A LABYRINTH THERE WERE PLEASANT ODOURS NOW AND THEN
6385-34655-0030 AND HE CROSSED CURRENTS OF PERFUME AS THOUGH PASSING BY INVISIBLE FLOWERS IT WAS WARM CARPETS EVERYWHERE ONE MIGHT HAVE WALKED ABOUT THERE UNCLOTHED GWYNPLAINE LOOKED OUT OF THE WINDOWS THE VIEW FROM EACH ONE WAS DIFFERENT
6385-34655-0032 HE STOOD STILL AND LISTENED OH I WILL GET OUT OF THIS PLACE SAID HE
6385-34655-0033 THEY SHALL NOT KEEP ME HERE BY FORCE WOE TO HIM WHO BARS MY EXIT WHAT IS THAT GREAT TOWER YONDER IF THERE WAS A GIANT A HELL HOUND A MINOTAUR TO KEEP THE GATE OF THIS ENCHANTED PALACE I WOULD ANNIHILATE HIM IF AN ARMY I WOULD EXTERMINATE IT
6385-34655-0035 PUSHED IT ASIDE ENTERED
6385-34669-0000 CHAPTER ONE A WATCH DOG MAY BE A GUARDIAN ANGEL GWYNPLAINE UTTERED A CRY IS THAT YOU WOLF HOMO WAGGED HIS TAIL HIS EYES SPARKLED IN THE DARKNESS HE WAS LOOKING EARNESTLY AT GWYNPLAINE
6385-34669-0002 OR AT LEAST THE LIGHT WHICH LEADS TO IT REGAINED THE SUDDEN INTERVENTION OF SOME MYSTERIOUS CLEMENCY POSSESSED PERHAPS BY DESTINY LIFE SAYING BEHOLD ME IN THE DARKEST RECESS OF THE GRAVE
6385-34669-0003 THE VERY MOMENT IN WHICH ALL EXPECTATION HAS CEASED BRINGING BACK HEALTH AND DELIVERANCE A PLACE OF SAFETY DISCOVERED AT THE MOST CRITICAL INSTANT IN THE MIDST OF CRUMBLING RUINS HOMO WAS ALL THIS TO GWYNPLAINE THE WOLF APPEARED TO HIM
6385-34669-0005 AND GWYNPLAINE GUIDED BY HOMO DESCENDED IT HOMO TURNED HIS HEAD NOW AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT GWYNPLAINE WAS BEHIND HIM IN SOME SITUATIONS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE NOTHING APPROACHES SO NEAR AN OMNISCIENT INTELLIGENCE
6385-34669-0006 AS THE SIMPLE INSTINCT OF A FAITHFUL ANIMAL AN ANIMAL IS A LUCID SOMNAMBULIST THERE ARE CASES IN WHICH THE DOG FEELS THAT HE SHOULD FOLLOW HIS MASTER OTHERS IN WHICH HE SHOULD PRECEDE HIM THEN THE ANIMAL TAKES THE DIRECTION OF SENSE
6385-34669-0008 PROBABLY NOT PERHAPS HE DOES IN ANY CASE SOME ONE KNOWS IT FOR HIM AS WE HAVE ALREADY SAID IT OFTEN HAPPENS IN LIFE THAT SOME MIGHTY HELP
6385-34669-0009 WHICH WE HAVE HELD TO HAVE COME FROM BELOW HAS IN REALITY COME FROM ABOVE WHO KNOWS ALL THE MYSTERIOUS FORMS ASSUMED BY GOD WHAT WAS THIS ANIMAL PROVIDENCE HAVING REACHED THE RIVER
6385-34669-0011 A WOODEN PLATFORM APPEARED ON THE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PLATFORM WHICH WAS A KIND OF WHARF ON PILES
6385-34669-0012 A BLACK MASS COULD BE MADE OUT WHICH WAS A TOLERABLY LARGE VESSEL ON THE DECK OF THE VESSEL NEAR THE PROW WAS A GLIMMER LIKE THE LAST FLICKER OF A NIGHT LIGHT
6385-34669-0014 THERE WAS THUS A FORECASTLE AND AN AFTERDECK AS IN OUR OLD RIVER BOATS AND A SPACE BETWEEN THEM BALLASTED BY THE FREIGHT THE PAPER BOATS MADE BY CHILDREN ARE OF A SOMEWHAT SIMILAR SHAPE UNDER THE DECKS WERE THE CABINS
6385-34669-0015 THE DOORS OF WHICH OPENED INTO THE HOLD AND WERE LIGHTED BY GLAZED PORTHOLES IN STOWING THE CARGO A PASSAGE WAS LEFT BETWEEN THE PACKAGES OF WHICH IT CONSISTED THESE VESSELS HAD A MAST ON EACH DECK THE FOREMAST WAS CALLED PAUL
6385-34669-0017 THE STRENGTH OF THE RUDDER BEING NECESSARILY PROPORTIONED TO THE HEIGHT OF THE VESSEL THREE MEN THE SKIPPER AND TWO SAILORS WITH A CABIN BOY SUFFICED TO NAVIGATE THESE PONDEROUS SEA GOING MACHINES THE DECKS FORE AND AFT
6385-34669-0018 THE GREAT LUMBERING HULL OF THIS PARTICULAR VESSEL WAS PAINTED BLACK AND ON IT VISIBLE EVEN IN THE NIGHT STOOD OUT IN WHITE LETTERS THE WORDS VOGRAAT ROTTERDAM
6385-34669-0020 AND MERCHANT VESSELS WERE ABLE TO SAIL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN LONDON AND ROTTERDAM WITHOUT A CONVOY THE VESSEL ON WHICH WAS TO BE READ THE WORD VOGRAAT AND WHICH GWYNPLAINE WAS NOW CLOSE TO LAY WITH HER MAIN DECK ALMOST LEVEL WITH THE WHARF
6385-34669-0021 BUT ONE STEP TO DESCEND AND HOMO IN A BOUND AND GWYNPLAINE IN A STRIDE WERE ON BOARD THE DECK WAS CLEAR AND NO STIR WAS PERCEPTIBLE THE PASSENGERS IF AS WAS LIKELY THERE WERE ANY WERE ALREADY ON BOARD
6385-34669-0023 IN SUCH CASES THE PASSENGERS DO NOT APPEAR ON DECK TILL THEY AWAKE THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS FOR THE CREW THEY WERE PROBABLY HAVING THEIR SUPPER IN THE MEN'S CABIN WHILST AWAITING THE HOUR FIXED FOR SAILING WHICH WAS NOW RAPIDLY APPROACHING HENCE
6385-34669-0024 THE SILENCE ON THE TWO DECKS CONNECTED BY THE GANGWAY THE WOLF HAD ALMOST RUN ACROSS THE WHARF ONCE ON BOARD HE SLACKENED HIS PACE INTO A DISCREET WALK HE STILL WAGGED HIS TAIL NO LONGER JOYFULLY HOWEVER
6385-34669-0026 IT LEANT OVER FEEBLY ON ONE SIDE IT HAD BECOME QUITE PARALYTIC FROM DISUSE AND MOREOVER IT WAS SUFFERING FROM THAT INCURABLE MALADY OLD AGE MOULDY AND OUT OF SHAPE IT TOTTERED IN DECAY
6385-34669-0027 THE IRON WAS RUSTY THE LEATHER TORN THE WOOD WORK WORM EATEN THERE WERE LINES OF CRACKS ACROSS THE WINDOW IN FRONT THROUGH WHICH SHONE A RAY FROM THE LANTERN THE WHEELS WERE WARPED THE LINING THE FLOOR
6385-34669-0029 THE WHOLE THING WAS IN A STATE OF DISLOCATION BENEATH IT WAS HANGING HOMO'S CHAIN
6385-34669-0030 DOES IT NOT SEEM THAT THE LAW AND THE WILL OF NATURE WOULD HAVE DICTATED GWYNPLAINE'S HEADLONG RUSH TO THROW HIMSELF UPON LIFE HAPPINESS LOVE REGAINED SO THEY WOULD
6385-34669-0032 THE GATES OF PARADISE REOPEN BUT BEFORE HE ENTERS HE EXAMINES HIS GROUND
6385-220959-0000 PART TWO SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS
6385-220959-0002 AND OF OTHERS OF WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK SO THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEMS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD IS THIS THAT HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS OF TWO KINDS ONE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES
6385-220959-0003 THAT IS TO SAY THINGS WHICH THE EYE OR EAR OR SMELL OR TASTE OR TOUCH CAN PERCEIVE WHICH ARE CALLED OBJECTIVE OR SENSIBLE SO THE SUN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SEEN IS SAID TO BE OBJECTIVE
6385-220959-0005 ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES SO LOVE IS A MENTAL REALITY AND NOT SENSIBLE FOR THIS REALITY THE EAR DOES NOT HEAR THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE SMELL DOES NOT PERCEIVE
6385-220959-0006 THE TASTE DOES NOT DISCERN THE TOUCH DOES NOT FEEL EVEN ETHEREAL MATTER THE FORCES OF WHICH ARE SAID IN PHYSICS TO BE HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
6385-220959-0008 IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
6385-220959-0009 ITS CONDITION ITS STATION ONE IS OBLIGED TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS UNDER THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS BECAUSE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD ALL THAT EXISTS IS SENSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE GRIEF AND HAPPINESS ARE INTELLECTUAL THINGS
6385-220959-0011 THOUGH HE IS REMAINING IN THE SAME PLACE OR AGAIN SUCH A ONE'S POSITION WAS EXALTED ALTHOUGH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HE WALKS UPON THE EARTH THIS EXALTATION AND THIS PROGRESS ARE SPIRITUAL STATES AND INTELLECTUAL REALITIES
6385-220959-0012 BUT TO EXPLAIN THEM YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN THE EXTERIOR WORLD THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT SENSIBLE SO THE SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT AND OF IGNORANCE DARKNESS BUT REFLECT
6385-220959-0014 BUT WHEN YOU DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEM OUTWARDLY YOU CALL KNOWLEDGE LIGHT AND IGNORANCE DARKNESS YOU SAY MY HEART WAS GLOOMY AND IT BECAME ENLIGHTENED
6385-220959-0015 NOW THAT LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES NOT SENSIBLE ONES BUT WHEN WE SEEK FOR EXPLANATIONS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE ARE OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM A SENSIBLE FORM
6385-220959-0017 THUS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IT IS SAID THAT GOD APPEARED AS A PILLAR OF FIRE THIS DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE MATERIAL FORM IT IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE IMAGE
6385-220959-0018 A SIMILE A METAPHOR AND IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED LITERALLY IT IS NOT A STATE THAT CAN BE COMPREHENDED BY MAN SLEEPING AND WAKING IS PASSING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER SLEEPING IS THE CONDITION OF REPOSE
6385-220959-0020 SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF MYSTERY WAKEFULNESS IS THE STATE OF MANIFESTATION FOR EXAMPLE IT IS A PERSIAN AND ARABIC EXPRESSION TO SAY THAT THE EARTH WAS ASLEEP AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT AWOKE
6385-220959-0021 OR THE EARTH WAS DEAD AND THE SPRING CAME AND IT REVIVED THESE EXPRESSIONS ARE METAPHORS ALLEGORIES MYSTIC EXPLANATIONS IN THE WORLD OF SIGNIFICATION BRIEFLY THE HOLY MANIFESTATIONS HAVE EVER BEEN
6385-220959-0023 IN REGARD TO THIS QUESTION THEOLOGIANS AND MATERIALISTS DISAGREE THE THEOLOGIANS BELIEVE THAT CHRIST WAS BORN OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BUT THE MATERIALISTS THINK THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE AND INADMISSIBLE
6385-220959-0024 AND THAT WITHOUT DOUBT HE HAD A HUMAN FATHER IN THE QUR'AN IT IS SAID AND WE SENT OUR SPIRIT UNTO HER
6385-220959-0026 AND OF EVERYTHING HAVE WE CREATED TWO KINDS THAT IS TO SAY WE HAVE CREATED ALL THE BEINGS THROUGH PAIRING BRIEFLY THEY SAY A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER CANNOT BE IMAGINED
6385-220959-0027 IN ANSWER THE THEOLOGIANS SAY THIS THING IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE AND UNACHIEVABLE BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN AND THERE IS A GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A THING WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE AND ONE WHICH IS UNKNOWN FOR EXAMPLE
6385-220959-0029 THE MATERIALISTS INSIST UPON THIS BELIEF AND THE THEOLOGIANS REPLY IS THIS GLOBE ETERNAL OR PHENOMENAL THE MATERIALISTS ANSWER THAT ACCORDING TO SCIENCE AND IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES IT IS ESTABLISHED THAT IT IS PHENOMENAL
6385-220959-0030 IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS A FLAMING GLOBE AND GRADUALLY IT BECAME TEMPERATE A CRUST WAS FORMED AROUND IT AND UPON THIS CRUST PLANTS CAME INTO EXISTENCE THEN ANIMALS AND FINALLY MAN THE THEOLOGIANS SAY
6385-220959-0032 WHETHER IT BE GRADUALLY OR AT ONCE THERE CAN REMAIN NO DOUBT THAT A MAN WITHOUT A HUMAN FATHER IS ALSO POSSIBLE AND ADMISSIBLE YOU CANNOT CONSIDER THIS IMPOSSIBLE OTHERWISE YOU ARE ILLOGICAL FOR EXAMPLE
6385-220959-0033 IF YOU SAY THAT THIS LAMP HAS ONCE BEEN LIGHTED WITHOUT WICK AND OIL AND THEN SAY THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIGHT IT WITHOUT THE WICK THIS IS ILLOGICAL CHRIST HAD A MOTHER THE FIRST MAN AS THE MATERIALISTS BELIEVE
6385-220959-0035 WHICH CAN BE COMPARED TO FATHER AND MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE PERFECTION BUT THE DARKNESS HAS NEITHER SUBSTANCE NOR FORM NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER AND IT IS ABSOLUTE IMPERFECTION THE SUBSTANCE OF ADAM'S PHYSICAL LIFE WAS EARTH
6385-220959-0036 BUT THE SUBSTANCE OF ABRAHAM WAS PURE SPERM IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE PURE AND CHASTE SPERM IS SUPERIOR TO EARTH FURTHERMORE IN THE FIRST CHAPTER OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN VERSES TWELVE AND THIRTEEN IT IS SAID
6385-220959-0038 ALSO IS NOT CREATED BY PHYSICAL POWER BUT BY THE SPIRITUAL REALITY THE HONOR AND GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS NOT DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE DID NOT HAVE A HUMAN FATHER BUT TO HIS PERFECTIONS BOUNTIES AND DIVINE GLORY
6385-220959-0039 IF THE GREATNESS OF CHRIST IS HIS BEING FATHERLESS THEN ADAM IS GREATER THAN CHRIST FOR HE HAD NEITHER FATHER NOR MOTHER IT IS SAID IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE LORD GOD FORMED MAN OF THE DUST OF THE GROUND
6385-220959-0041 MOREOVER THE EXPRESSION WHICH JOHN USES IN REGARD TO THE DISCIPLES PROVES THAT THEY ALSO ARE FROM THE HEAVENLY FATHER HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE HOLY REALITY MEANING THE REAL EXISTENCE OF EVERY GREAT MAN COMES FROM GOD
6385-220959-0042 AND OWES ITS BEING TO THE BREATH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
6415-100596-0000 THE ELUSIVE KATE FERRIS THE MYSTERIOUS KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0001 FOR A WHOLE SEMESTER ENTERED UPON HER COLLEGE CAREER IN AN ENTIRELY UNPREMEDITATED AND IMPROMPTU MANNER IT BEGAN ONE DAY AWAY BACK IN NOVEMBER
6415-100596-0003 THE STUDY HAS BEEN SO FULL OF FRESHMEN ALL THE TIME THAT I TOLD HER TO HANG IT ON THE DOOR AND LET THEM JOIN OUTSIDE IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY PATTY TURNED THE LEAVES AND RAN HER EYES DOWN THE LIST OF SPRAWLING SIGNATURES IT'S A POPULAR ORGANIZATION ISN'T IT
6415-100596-0004 THE FRESHMEN ARE SIMPLY SCRAMBLING TO GET IN THEY'RE TRYING TO SHOW FRAEULEIN SCHERIN HOW MUCH INTEREST THEY TAKE IN THE SUBJECT GEORGIE LAUGHED PATTY PICKED UP THE PENCIL WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN
6415-100596-0006 PATTY POISED THE PENCIL A MOMENT AND ABSTRACTEDLY TRACED THE NAME KATE FERRIS GEORGIE LAUGHED IF THERE SHOULD HAPPEN TO BE A KATE FERRIS IN COLLEGE SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED TO FIND HERSELF A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN CLUB
6415-100596-0007 AND THE INCIDENT WAS FORGOTTEN A FEW DAYS LATER THE TWO CAME IN FROM CLASS TO FIND PRISCILLA AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE GERMAN CLUB SITTING ON THE DIVAN WITH THEIR HEADS TOGETHER FRANTICALLY TURNING THE LEAVES OF THE CATALOGUE
6415-100596-0009 GEORGIE AND PATTY EXCHANGED GLANCES AND INQUIRED THE TROUBLE A GIRL NAMED KATE FERRIS HAS REGISTERED FOR THE GERMAN CLUB AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THE CLASSES AND THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY SUCH GIRL IN COLLEGE POSSIBLY A SPECIAL
6415-100596-0010 PRISCILLA PRODUCED THE REGISTRATION LIST AND TRIUMPHANTLY EXHIBITED AN UNMISTAKABLE KATE FERRIS THEY FORGOT TO PUT HER IN THE CATALOGUE I NEVER KNEW THEM TO MAKE SUCH A MISTAKE BEFORE SAID THE PRESIDENT DUBIOUSLY I DON'T BELIEVE WE'D BETTER PUT HER IN THE ROLL BOOK
6415-100596-0012 SHE HASN'T PAID HER DUES AND AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT
6415-100596-0013 BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ATTEND CLASSES LATELY KATE FERRIS PRISCILLA EXHIBITED THE NOTE TO THE PRESIDENT AS A TANGIBLE PROOF THAT KATE FERRIS STILL EXISTED AND REINSCRIBED THE NAME IN THE ROLL BOOK
6415-100596-0015 I LEFT MY LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON THE BOOKCASE KATE FERRIS AS PRISCILLA SCRATCHED THE NAME OUT OF THE ROLL BOOK AGAIN SHE REMARKED TO PATTY
6415-100596-0016 AND ADVISED ME TO STAY IN IT SO I SHALL BE MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU WILL NOT PRESENT MY LETTER AT THE MEETING AFTER ALL AS I HAVE DECIDED TO FOLLOW HER ADVICE KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0018 THAT KATE FERRIS IS ACTUALLY COMING THROUGH ON THE OTHER SIDE IF SHE CHANGES HER MIND MANY MORE TIMES THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING LEFT
6415-100596-0019 PRISCILLA DECLARED SHE'S MADE ME SO MUCH TROUBLE THAT I'M CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE SHE DID ASK FRAEULEIN SCHERIN
6415-100596-0021 PRISCILLA KEPT HEARING ABOUT THE GIRL ON ALL SIDES BUT COULD NEVER CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HER
6415-100596-0022 BUT PRISCILLA ALWAYS HAPPENED TO BE OUT HER NAME WAS POSTED ON THE BULLETIN BOARD FOR HAVING LIBRARY BOOKS THAT WERE OVERDUE SHE EVEN WROTE A PAPER FOR ONE OF THE GERMAN CLUB MEETINGS GEORGIE WAS NOT A FACILE GERMAN SCHOLAR AND IT HAD REQUIRED A WHOLE SATURDAY
6415-100596-0024 ON THE EVENING OF THE TEA AFTER THE GUESTS HAD GONE AND THE FURNITURE HAD BEEN MOVED BACK THE WEARY HOSTESSES IN SOMEWHAT RUMPLED EVENING DRESSES A CONSIDERABLE CRUSH RESULTS WHEN FIFTY ARE ENTERTAINED IN A ROOM WHOSE UTMOST CAPACITY IS FIFTEEN
6415-100596-0025 WERE REENTERTAINING ONE OR TWO FRIENDS ON THE LETTUCE SANDWICHES AND CAKES THE OBLIGING GUESTS HAD FAILED TO CONSUME THE COMPANY AND THE CLOTHES HAVING PASSED IN REVIEW THE CONVERSATION FLAGGED A LITTLE AND GEORGIE SUDDENLY ASKED
6415-100596-0027 I BEGIN TO THINK SO MYSELF SAID PATTY THE NEXT MORNING'S MAIL BROUGHT A BUNCH OF VIOLETS AND AN APOLOGY FROM KATE FERRIS
6415-100596-0028 IT'S POSITIVELY UNCANNY PRISCILLA DECLARED I SHALL GO TO THE REGISTRAR AND TELL HER THAT THIS KATE FERRIS IS NEITHER DOWN IN THE CATALOGUE NOR THE COLLEGE DIRECTORY AND FIND OUT WHERE SHE LIVES
6415-100596-0030 PERHAPS IT IS HARRIS INSTEAD OF FERRIS PRISCILLA FACED HER OMINOUSLY YOU READ THE NAME YOURSELF IT WAS AS PLAIN AS PRINTING WE'RE ALL LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES PATTY MURMURED SOOTHINGLY DO YOU KNOW
6415-100596-0031 SAID GEORGIE I BEGIN TO THINK IT'S ALL A HALLUCINATION AND THAT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY KATE FERRIS IT'S STRANGE OF COURSE BUT NOT ANY STRANGER THAN SOME OF THOSE CASES YOU READ ABOUT IN PSYCHOLOGY
6415-100596-0033 PATTY SHOOK HER HEAD NOT JUST NOW I SHOULDN'T DARE SHE BELIEVES IN CORPORAL PUNISHMENT A FEW DAYS LATER PRISCILLA RECEIVED ANOTHER NOTE DIRECTED IN THE HAND SHE HAD COME TO DREAD SHE THREW IT INTO THE WASTE BASKET UNOPENED
6415-100596-0034 BUT CURIOSITY PREVAILING SHE DREW IT OUT AGAIN AND READ IT DEAR MISS POND AS I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO LEAVE COLLEGE ON ACCOUNT OF MY HEALTH I INCLOSE MY RESIGNATION TO THE GERMAN CLUB I THANK YOU VERY SINCERELY FOR YOUR KINDNESS TO ME THIS YEAR
6415-111615-0000 OR ANY PAINFUL JOB SO FULL OF PLEASURES AS THE TASK OF CONDUCTING A NEWSPAPER COLUMN THE
6415-111615-0001 IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE NOBODY NOTICES IT HE SOON OUTGROWS THIS AND IS DISHEARTENED BECAUSE TOO MANY PEOPLE NOTICE IT AND HE IMAGINES THAT ALL SEE THE PALTRINESS OF IT AS PLAINLY AS HE DOES
6415-111615-0003 BROODING AT THE SLUTTISH TYPEWRITER HE REMEMBERS THE FLUSH OF SHAME THAT TINGLED HIM AS HE WALKED SADLY HOMEWARD THINKING OF SOME ATROCIOUS INANITY HE HAD SENT UPSTAIRS TO THE COMPOSING ROOM IT IS A JOB THAT ENGENDERS A HEALTHY HUMILITY
6415-111615-0004 I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO HAVE A TRY AT WRITING A COLUMN HEAVEN HELP ME I THINK I HAD AN IDEA THAT I WAS BORN FOR THE JOB I MAY AS WELL BE CANDID THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY THOUGHT OF INSERTING THE FOLLOWING AD IN A PHILADELPHIA NEWSPAPER
6415-111615-0006 A GUARANTEED CIRCULATION GETTER SAID HUMORIST CAN ALSO SUPPLY EXCELLENT VEINS OF PHILOSOPHY POETRY SATIRE UPLIFT GLAD MATERIAL AND INDISCRIMINATE MUSINGS
6415-111615-0007 REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY NEWSPAPER DESIRING A REALLY UNUSUAL EDITORIAL FEATURE ADDRESS HUMORIST ET CETERA SO BESOTTED WAS I I WOULD HAVE PAID TO HAVE THIS PRINTED IF I HAD NOT BEEN COUNSELLED BY AN OLDER AND WISER HEAD
6415-111615-0009 HE HAS TO DEAL WITH THE MOST ELUSIVE AND GROTESQUE MATERIAL HE KNOWS HIS OWN MIND AND THE UNHAPPY CREATURE EVERLASTINGLY PROBING HIMSELF IN THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING WHAT IS SO RARE IN MINDS A THOUGHT IS LIKELY TO END IN A FERMENT OF BITTERNESS
6415-111615-0010 IF YOU HAVE TO BE ENDLESSLY SPECULATING WATCHING AND MAKING MENTAL NOTES YOUR BRAIN GEARS SOON GET A HOT BOX THE ORIGINAL OF ALL PARAGRAPHERS
6415-111615-0012 THE DOCTORS TELL US THAT ALL PATENT MEDICINES ARE BUILT ON A STOCK FORMULA A SEDATIVE A PURGE AND A BITTER IF YOU ARE TO MAKE STEADY COLUMN TOPERS OUT OF YOUR READERS YOUR DAILY DOSE MUST
6415-111615-0013 AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AVERAGE UP TO THAT SAME PRESCRIPTION IF YOU EMPLOY THE PURGE ALL THE TIME OR THE SEDATIVE OR THE ACID YOUR CLIENTS WILL SOON ASK FOR SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER LABEL
6415-111615-0015 THE FOLLOWING WORDS FROM ISAIAH THE BEST OF ALL WATCHWORDS FOR ALL WHO WRITE WOE UNTO THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD AND GOOD EVIL THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER
6415-111615-0016 THE MOST PAINFUL PRIVILEGE OF THE COLYUMIST'S JOB IS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DROP IN TO SEE HIM USUALLY WHEN HE IS IMPRECATING HIS WAY TOWARD THE HOUR OF GOING TO PRESS THIS IS ALL A PART OF THE GREAT AND SALUTARY HUMAN INSTINCT AGAINST WORK
6415-111615-0018 WITH ANYTHING BUT HUMILITY AND DESPAIR FRANK HARRIS ONCE SAID OF OSCAR WILDE IF ENGLAND INSISTS ON TREATING HER CRIMINALS LIKE THIS SHE DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY SIMILARLY
6415-111615-0019 IF THE PUBLIC INSISTS ON BRINGING ITS WOES TO ITS COLYUMISTS IT DOESN'T DESERVE TO HAVE ANY COLYUMISTS THEN THE BATTERED JESTER TURNS AGAIN TO HIS MACHINE AND TICKS OFF SOMETHING LIKE THIS
6415-111615-0021 ALL THAT ONE NEEDS TO DO TO THAT IS TO WRITE OVER IT THE CAPTION SO DO WE ALL AND PASS ON TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THE MORE A COLYUMIST IS OUT
6415-111615-0022 ON THE STREETS MAKING HIMSELF THE REPORTER OF THE MOODS AND ODDITIES OF MEN THE BETTER HIS STUFF WILL BE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HIS JOB OUGHT TO BE GOOD TRAINING FOR A NOVELIST AS IT TEACHES HIM A HABIT OF HUMAN SENSITIVENESS
6415-111615-0024 WHO WAS STANDING ON CHESTNUT STREET STUDYING A POCKET NOTEBOOK HIS UMBRELLA LEANED AGAINST A SHOP WINDOW ON THE SILL OF WHICH HE HAD LAID A CAREFULLY ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER BY HIS FEET WAS A NEAT LEATHER BRIEF CASE PLUMPLY FILLED WITH CONTENTS NOT DISCERNIBLE
6415-111615-0025 THERE HE STOOD A SORT OF UNSUCCESSFUL CYRUS CURTIS VERY DIMINUTIVE HIS GRAY HAIR RATHER LONG ABAFT HIS NECK HIS YELLOWISH STRAW HAT WITH CURLY BRIM TILTED BACKWARD AS THOUGH IN PERPLEXITY
6415-111615-0027 AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN MUCH TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEAK TO HIM I HALTED AT A WINDOW FARTHER DOWN THE STREET AND STUDIED HIM THEN RETURNED TO PASS HIM AGAIN AND WATCHED HIM PATIENTLY HE STOOD QUITE ABSORBED AND WAS STILL THERE WHEN I WENT ON
6415-111615-0028 THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE THOUSANDS OF VIVID LITTLE PICTURES ONE SEES ON THE CITY STREETS DAY BY DAY TO CATCH SOME HINT OF THE MEANING OF ALL THIS TO PRESENT A FEW SCRAWLED NOTES OF THE AMAZING INTEREST AND COLOUR OF THE CITY'S LIFE
6415-111615-0030 AND IT IS CARRIED ON IN SURROUNDINGS OF EXTRAORDINARY STIMULATION AND DIFFICULTY IT IS HEART RACKING TO STRUGGLE DAY BY DAY AMID INCESSANT INTERRUPTION AND MELEE TO SNATCH OUT OF THE HURLY BURLY SOME SHREDS OF HUMOUR OR PATHOS OR
6415-111615-0031 DARE ONE SAY BEAUTY AND PHRASE THEM INTELLIGIBLY BUT IT IS FUN ONE NEVER BUYS A PACKAGE OF TOBACCO CROSSES A CITY SQUARE ENTERS A TROLLEY CAR OR STUDIES A SHOP WINDOW WITHOUT TRYING IN A BAFFLED HOPELESS WAY
6415-111615-0033 WHO SEEMS BY THE WAY TO BE MORE READ BY NEWSPAPER MEN THAN ANY OTHER WRITER PUT VERY NOBLY THE PINNACLE OF ALL SCRIBBLERS DREAMS WHEN HE SAID THAT HUMAN AFFAIRS DESERVE THE TRIBUTE OF A SIGH WHICH IS NOT A SOB A SMILE
6415-111615-0034 WHICH IS NOT A GRIN SO MUCH WITH APOLOGY FOR THE IDEALS OF THE COLYUMIST IF HE BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK TRUTH WITHOUT FEAR OF MOCKERY OF COURSE IN THE ACTUAL PROCESS AND TRAVAIL OF HIS JOB YOU WILL FIND HIM FAR DIFFERENT
6415-111615-0036 HE FINDS THAT HIS MOST AUGUST MUSINGS HAVE A HABIT OF STEWING THEMSELVES DOWN TO SOME FEROCIOUS OR JOCULAR THREE LINE COMMENT
6415-111615-0037 TO CHURN UP FROM THE TYPEWRITER SOME LYRIC THAT WILL ROCK WITH BLUE SEAS AND FRANTIC HEARTS
6415-111615-0039 PERHAPS SOME DAY THE GOVERNMENT WILL CROWN A COLYUMIST LAUREATE SOME MAJESTIC SAGE WITH ANCIENT PATIENT BLUE EYES AND A SNOWY BEARD NOBLY STAINED WITH NICOTINE WHOSE UTTERANCES WILL BE HEEDED WITH SHUDDERING RESPECT
6415-116629-0000 STOOD IN HIS DOORWAY IN THE CLEAR SUNSHINE OF THIS LOVELY SUMMER MORNING BOTH HANDS PLUNGED DEEP INTO HIS POCKETS AS WAS HIS WONT AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM AS IF TO SEE WHETHER EVERYTHING IN THE OUTER WORLD WAS THE SAME AS YESTERDAY
6415-116629-0002 AND I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU A PRESENT THAT IS WORTH MORE THAN FIVE FRANCS TO A FELLOW LIKE YOU WHAT IS IT SHOW IT TO ME
6415-116629-0003 FIRST I WILL TELL YOU SOMETHING AND THEN YOU SHALL HAVE IT REPLIED JUDITH LOOK HERE BLASI MY SAINTED FATHER USED TO SAY IF YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKETS THEY WILL GET FULL BUT IF YOU KEEP THEM IN YOUR POCKETS WILL BE EMPTY NOW BOTH YOUR HANDS ARE IN YOUR POCKETS
6415-116629-0005 WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE A NICE WELL WASHED SHIRT FOR SUNDAY I WILL DO ONE UP FOR YOU IF YOU WILL TELL ME SOMETHING THAT WAS AN OFFER WORTH LISTENING TO SUNDAY WAS A WRETCHED DAY FOR BLASI FOR WHEN HE HAD TURNED HIS TWO SHIRTS AND WORN THEM BOTH ON BOTH SIDES
6415-116629-0006 HE HAD NEVER A CLEAN ONE FOR SUNDAY HE HAD NO ONE TO WASH FOR HIM HIS MOTHER WAS DEAD AND HIS FATHER HAD ENOUGH ELSE TO SPEND FOR WITHOUT THE WASHING FOR A GROWN UP SON BLASI'S MONEY WENT FOR OTHER THINGS THAN WASHING AND HE WAS NOT FOND OF DOING IT FOR HIMSELF
6415-116629-0008 SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO DIETRICH YES AND KEEPS ON HAPPENING ALL SORTS OF THINGS TOO BUT JOST CAN TELL YOU MORE THAN I CAN THEY SIT TOGETHER IN THE REHBOCK HALF THE NIGHT AND MORE TOO LONG AFTER EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GONE THERE THEY SIT IN THE LITTLE BACK ROOM
6415-116629-0009 I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT IT SOMEBODY COMES OVER FROM FOHRENSEE AND EXPLAINS IT TO THEM HE DOES NOT BELONG THERE BUT I GUESS YOU HAVE SEEN HIM
6415-116629-0011 DIETRICH PUTS IN MORE MONEY EVERY TIME JOST HAS NOTHING TO PUT IN BUT PROMISES HE TELLS DIETRICH ALL THE TIME THAT PRESENTLY THE WINNINGS WILL BEGIN TO FLOW IN AND SAYS THAT AT FIRST A FELLOW MUST EXPECT TO LOSE SO AS TO WIN ALL THE MORE IN THE END
6415-116629-0012 I AM JUST WAITING THOUGH TILL I CAN TRIP HIM UP AND I'LL DO IT WITH A VENGEANCE TOO SO THAT HE WON'T FORGET IT ALL HIS LIFE LONG NOW THAT IS A GOOD IDEA SAID JUDITH YOU'D BETTER TELL HIM THEN THAT YOU DO IT TO PAY YOUR DEBTS
6415-116629-0014 AS BLASI SPOKE HE CAME SLOWLY NEARER TO JUDITH HE HAS BEEN SAYING SOME THINGS LATELY THAT MADE ME THINK SO
6415-116629-0015 I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN HE WENT ON BUT I AM NOT SO VERY STUPID AS YOU THINK IT CERTAINLY MEANS SOMETHING WHEN SHE IS SO CHANGED JOST SAYS THAT SHE KNOWS ALL THAT DIETRICH HAS BEEN ABOUT
6415-116629-0017 AND HE SAYS TOO THAT HE HAS NOTICED FOR SOME TIME THAT SHE HAS NO OBJECTION TO LETTING DIETRICH SEE THAT SHE CAN GET ALONG VERY WELL WITHOUT HIS HELP AND YOU KNOW THAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF ANYTHING WHEN SHE'S ANGRY
6415-116629-0018 AND MUTTERED I WONDER IF SHE WANTS TO GET HIM TOO
6415-116629-0020 THIS VERY RESERVE HOWEVER WAS RATHER DISTASTEFUL TO JUDITH AS REGARDED HERSELF BUT SHE LIKED IT TOWARDS OTHERS SHE HAD PLANNED IT ALL OUT THAT DIETRICH SHOULD MARRY VERONICA SOON AFTER THE CONFIRMATION THAT THEY SHOULD SET UP A PRETTY LITTLE ESTABLISHMENT AND BE HER BELOVED NEIGHBORS
6415-116629-0021 JUDITH BOUNCED VIOLENTLY INTO THE KITCHEN AND SET HER JUG DOWN WITH SUCH A BANG THAT THE WATER SPURTED UP INTO THE AIR AND NO ONE CAN GET A WORD OUT OF HER EITHER IT IS EXACTLY AS IF ALL THE OIL HAD BEEN BURNED OUT THIS LAST REMARK REFERRED TO GERTRUDE
6415-116629-0023 AND IF THE LATTER SHOWED A DISPOSITION TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSEHOLD MATTERS OR HER CHILDREN'S FUTURE GERTRUDE WOULD GIVE HER TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE HAD NO TIME TO STOP TO TALK GERTRUDE KNEW WHERE DIETRICH SPENT HIS EVENINGS SHE HAD EXPOSTULATED WITH HIM ABOUT IT MORE THAN ONCE
6415-116629-0024 HE HAD ANSWERED THAT HE MUST KEEP ON THERE FOR AWHILE TILL A CERTAIN UNDERTAKING WHICH HE HAD STARTED WITH JOST WAS FAIRLY UNDER WAY HE ASSURED HER THAT THIS AFFAIR WAS CERTAIN TO TURN OUT ALL RIGHT AND THAT SHE HERSELF WOULD BE SURPRISED AND SATISFIED AT THE RESULT
6415-116629-0026 GERTRUDE HERSELF COULD SCARCELY UNDERSTAND POOR GERTRUDE ONE NIGHT AFTER SHE HAD GONE TO HER ROOM SHE HEARD HER SON LEAVE THE HOUSE WITH HASTY STEPS IT HAD BECOME A REGULAR THING NOW SHE HAD OFTEN SAID TO HERSELF
6415-116629-0027 AH HOW MUCH LONGER WILL THIS GO ON BUT SHE TRIED HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD SOON COME TO AN END AND HER SON WOULD RESUME HIS FORMER ORDERLY AND HAPPY MODE OF LIFE BUT THIS EVENING SHE WAS SO ANXIOUS THAT SHE COULD NOT STAY IN HER BEDROOM
6415-116629-0029 BUT HE KNEW THE STRAIGHT ROAD AND WOULD NOT HIS STEPS TURN BACK TO IT AGAIN HER THOUGHTS WENT BACK TO THE DAYS WHEN HER LITTLE DIETERLI LOVED GOOD AND ORDERLY CONDUCT IT COULD NOT BE THAT HE HAD LOST HIS LOVE FOR IT
6415-116629-0030 THAT IN THE RIGHT CONDUCT OF LIFE LIES INWARD AND OUTWARD BLESSING SHE RECALLED THE EVENING OF THE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND WAS BORNE FROM THE HOUSE TO HIS BURIAL SHE HAD TAKEN THE CHILDREN BY THE HAND AND STUPEFIED WITH PAIN WAS ABOUT TO PUT THEM TO BED
6415-116629-0032 SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHE FOLDED HER HANDS IN PRAYER FOR HER HABIT WAS TO LAY ALL HER TROUBLES BEFORE GOD HER SUPPORTER AND COMFORTER AT THIS MOMENT SHE HEARD THROUGH THE STILLNESS LOUD SHOUTS AND CRIES FIRST AT A DISTANCE
6415-116629-0033 THEN NEARER AND NEARER UNTIL THEY GREW INTO A WILD TUMULT THEN MANY OF THE VOICES SEEMED TO SCATTER IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHILE SOME SOUNDED AS IF APPROACHING THE GARDEN A VAGUE FEAR SEIZED GERTRUDE
6415-116629-0035 SAID GERTRUDE WHITE WITH TERROR DON'T LEAVE ME SO BUT TELL ME BLASI WHY DIETRICH HASN'T COME HOME WITH THE REST OF YOU BLASI HAD TOO MUCH RESPECT FOR DIETRICH'S MOTHER TO RUN AWAY FROM HER WHEN SHE PUT A DIRECT QUESTION TO HIM ALTHOUGH HE WOULD FAIN HAVE ESCAPED
6415-116629-0036 TWO MEN WERE KILLED SOME ONE STOLE THE CATTLE DEALER'S MONEY BAG IS DIETRICH KILLED SPEAK OUT BROKE IN GERTRUDE TREMBLING NO HE STRUCK ABOUT HIM BRAVELY TILL ONE OF THE FELLOWS GOT ENOUGH OF IT AND LAY DEAD ON THE GROUND
6415-116629-0038 GERTRUDE MOUNTED WEARILY TO HER ROOM AS IF HER LAST DAY WAS COME SHE SAT DOWN UPON HER BED AND WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT FILLED THE ROOM STILL SHE SAT THERE LISTENING IN TREMBLING ANXIETY
6415-116629-0039 AS SHE HAD LISTENED THROUGH ALL THE LONG NIGHT IN VAIN DIETRICH HAD NOT COME HOME IN THE NIGHT
6437-66172-0001 THE DISTRACTION WHICH PREVAILED IN THE CLASSES THE WEEK PRECEDING THE FOURTH HAD SUBSIDED AND NOTHING REMAINED TO INDICATE THE RECENT FESTIVITIES EXCEPTING A NOTICEABLE WANT OF EYEBROWS ON THE PART OF PEPPER WHITCOMB AND MYSELF
6437-66172-0002 IN AUGUST WE HAD TWO WEEKS VACATION IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME THAT I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE RIVERMOUTH CENTIPEDES A SECRET SOCIETY COMPOSED OF TWELVE OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS
6437-66172-0004 THOUGH I WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE BODY DURING THE REMAINDER OF MY RESIDENCE AT RIVERMOUTH AND AT ONE TIME HELD THE ONEROUS POSITION OF F C FIRST CENTIPEDE EACH OF THE ELECT WORE A COPPER CENT
6437-66172-0005 SOME OCCULT ASSOCIATION BEING ESTABLISHED BETWEEN A CENT APIECE AND A CENTIPEDES SUSPENDED BY A STRING ROUND HIS NECK THE MEDALS WERE WORN NEXT THE SKIN AND IT WAS WHILE BATHING ONE DAY AT GRAVE POINT WITH JACK HARRIS AND FRED LANGDON
6437-66172-0007 THE INITIATION CEREMONY TOOK PLACE IN FRED LANGDON'S BARN WHERE I WAS SUBMITTED TO A SERIES OF TRIALS NOT CALCULATED TO SOOTHE THE NERVES OF A TIMOROUS BOY BEFORE BEING LED TO THE GROTTO OF ENCHANTMENT
6437-66172-0008 SUCH WAS THE MODEST TITLE GIVEN TO THE LOFT OVER MY FRIEND'S WOOD HOUSE MY HANDS WERE SECURELY PINIONED AND MY EYES COVERED WITH A THICK SILK HANDKERCHIEF AT THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS I WAS TOLD IN AN UNRECOGNIZABLE HUSKY VOICE
6437-66172-0010 A PROLONGED SILENCE FOLLOWED THIS PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION AND I WAS WONDERING WHAT WOULD COME NEXT
6437-66172-0011 THE UNKNOWN VOICE THEN DIRECTED ME TO TAKE TEN STEPS FORWARD AND STOP AT THE WORD HALT I TOOK TEN STEPS AND HALTED STRICKEN MORTAL SAID A SECOND HUSKY VOICE MORE HUSKY IF POSSIBLE THAN THE FIRST
6437-66172-0013 GENTLY CHECKED MY RETREAT I WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO THE BRINK OF SEVERAL OTHER PRECIPICES AND ORDERED TO STEP OVER MANY DANGEROUS CHASMS WHERE THE RESULT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSTANT DEATH IF I HAD COMMITTED THE LEAST MISTAKE
6437-66172-0014 I HAVE NEGLECTED TO SAY THAT MY MOVEMENTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY DISMAL GROANS FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE GROTTO FINALLY I WAS LED UP A STEEP PLANK TO WHAT APPEARED TO ME AN INCALCULABLE HEIGHT
6437-66172-0016 SURROUNDED BY TWELVE MASKED FIGURES FANTASTICALLY DRESSED ONE OF THE CONSPIRATORS WAS REALLY APPALLING WITH A TIN SAUCE PAN ON HIS HEAD AND A TIGER SKIN SLEIGH ROBE THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS I SCARCELY NEED SAY
6437-66172-0017 THAT THERE WERE NO VESTIGES TO BE SEEN OF THE FEARFUL GULFS OVER WHICH I HAD PASSED SO CAUTIOUSLY MY ASCENT HAD BEEN TO THE TOP OF THE HOGSHEAD AND MY DESCENT TO THE BOTTOM THEREOF HOLDING ONE ANOTHER BY THE HAND AND CHANTING A LOW DIRGE
6437-66172-0019 I AFTERWARDS HAD A GOOD DEAL OF SPORT OUT OF THE CLUB FOR THESE INITIATIONS AS YOU MAY IMAGINE WERE SOMETIMES VERY COMICAL SPECTACLES ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ASPIRANT FOR CENTIPEDAL HONORS HAPPENED TO BE OF A TIMID DISPOSITION
6437-66172-0020 IF HE SHOWED THE SLIGHTEST TERROR HE WAS CERTAIN TO BE TRICKED UNMERCIFULLY ONE OF OUR SUBSEQUENT DEVICES A HUMBLE INVENTION OF MY OWN WAS TO REQUEST THE BLINDFOLDED CANDIDATE TO PUT OUT HIS TONGUE WHEREUPON THE FIRST CENTIPEDE WOULD SAY
6437-66172-0022 OUR MEETINGS WERE HELD IN VARIOUS BARNS AT NO STATED PERIODS BUT AS CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGESTED ANY MEMBER HAD A RIGHT TO CALL A MEETING EACH BOY WHO FAILED TO REPORT HIMSELF WAS FINED ONE CENT
6437-66172-0023 WHENEVER A MEMBER HAD REASONS FOR THINKING THAT ANOTHER MEMBER WOULD BE UNABLE TO ATTEND HE CALLED A MEETING FOR INSTANCE IMMEDIATELY ON LEARNING THE DEATH OF HARRY BLAKE'S GREAT GRANDFATHER I ISSUED A CALL
6437-66172-0025 THAT THE CENTIPEDES WERE TO STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ON ALL OCCASIONS THOUGH I DON'T REMEMBER THAT THEY DID BUT FURTHER THAN THIS WE HAD NO PURPOSE UNLESS IT WAS TO ACCOMPLISH AS A BODY THE SAME AMOUNT OF MISCHIEF WHICH WE WERE SURE TO DO AS INDIVIDUALS
6437-66172-0026 TO MYSTIFY THE STAID AND SLOW GOING RIVERMOUTHIANS WAS OUR FREQUENT PLEASURE SEVERAL OF OUR PRANKS WON US SUCH A REPUTATION AMONG THE TOWNSFOLK THAT WE WERE CREDITED WITH HAVING A LARGE FINGER IN WHATEVER WENT AMISS IN THE PLACE ONE MORNING
6437-66172-0028 JONES'S AVENUE AT THE NORTH END HAD SUDDENLY BECOME WALNUT STREET AND PEANUT STREET WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND CONFUSION REIGNED THE TOWN AUTHORITIES TOOK THE MATTER IN HAND WITHOUT DELAY
6437-66172-0029 AND SIX OF THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL BOYS WERE SUMMONED TO APPEAR BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPBAM HAVING TEARFULLY DISCLAIMED TO MY GRANDFATHER ALL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRANSACTION I DISAPPEARED FROM THE FAMILY CIRCLE AND WAS NOT APPREHENDED UNTIL LATE IN THE AFTERNOON
6437-66172-0031 TO ANSWER THE DEMANDS OF THE OUTRAGED LAWS CHARLEY MARDEN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF IN A PILE OF GRAVEL BEHIND HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND LOOKED LIKE A RECENTLY EXHUMED MUMMY THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST EVIDENCE AGAINST US AND INDEED WE WERE WHOLLY INNOCENT OF THE OFFENCE
6437-66172-0032 THE TRICK AS WAS AFTERWARDS PROVED HAD BEEN PLAYED BY A PARTY OF SOLDIERS STATIONED AT THE FORT IN THE HARBOR WE WERE INDEBTED FOR OUR ARREST TO MASTER CONWAY WHO HAD SLYLY DROPPED A HINT WITHIN THE HEARING OF SELECTMAN MUDGE TO THE EFFECT THAT
6437-66172-0034 IT WAS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT CONWAY'S ANIMOSITY SHOULD NOT BE QUIETLY SUBMITTED TO HE HAD SOUGHT TO INFORM AGAINST US IN THE STAGECOACH BUSINESS HE HAD VOLUNTEERED TO CARRY PETTINGIL'S LITTLE BILL FOR TWENTY FOUR ICECREAMS TO CHARLEY MARDEN'S FATHER
6437-66172-0035 AND NOW HE HAD CAUSED US TO BE ARRAIGNED BEFORE JUSTICE CLAPHAM ON A CHARGE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS AND PAINFUL AFTER MUCH NOISY DISCUSSION A PLAN OF RETALIATION WAS AGREED UPON
6437-66172-0037 IT WAS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT THE WIDOW CONWAY HAD NOT BURIED HER HEART WITH THE LATE LAMENTED AS TO HER SHYNESS THAT WAS NOT SO CLEAR INDEED HER ATTENTIONS TO MISTER MEEKS WHOSE MOTHER SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
6437-66172-0038 WERE OF A NATURE NOT TO BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND WERE NOT MISUNDERSTOOD BY ANYONE BUT MISTER MEEKS HIMSELF THE WIDOW CARRIED ON A DRESS MAKING ESTABLISHMENT AT HER RESIDENCE ON THE CORNER OPPOSITE MEEKS'S DRUG STORE
6437-66172-0040 THE LADY'S FONDNESS AND THE GENTLEMAN'S BLINDNESS WERE TOPICS ABLY HANDLED AT EVERY SEWING CIRCLE IN THE TOWN IT WAS THROUGH THESE TWO LUCKLESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WE PROPOSED TO STRIKE A BLOW AT THE COMMON ENEMY
6437-66172-0041 TO KILL LESS THAN THREE BIRDS WITH ONE STONE DID NOT SUIT OUR SANGUINARY PURPOSE WE DISLIKED THE WIDOW NOT SO MUCH FOR HER SENTIMENTALITY AS FOR BEING THE MOTHER OF BILL CONWAY WE DISLIKED MISTER MEEKS NOT BECAUSE HE WAS INSIPID
6437-66172-0043 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AS THE ORDERLY CITIZENS WENDED THEIR WAY TO CHURCH PAST THE WIDOW'S ABODE THEIR SOBER FACES RELAXED AT BEHOLDING OVER HER FRONT DOOR THE WELL KNOWN GILT MORTAR AND PESTLE WHICH USUALLY STOOD ON THE TOP OF A POLE ON THE OPPOSITE CORNER
6437-66172-0044 WAS RECOGNIZED AT ONCE IT SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE OVER THE TOWN AND THOUGH THE MORTAR AND THE PLACARD WERE SPEEDILY REMOVED OUR TRIUMPH WAS COMPLETE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WAS ON THE BROAD GRIN AND OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE AFFAIR SEEMINGLY UNSUSPECTED
6437-66173-0001 HIS RED HAIR SEEMED TO CHANGE TO A LIVELIER RED AND HIS SALLOW CHEEKS TO A DEEPER SALLOW AS WE GLANCED AT HIM STEALTHILY OVER THE TOPS OF OUR SLATES THE NEXT DAY IN SCHOOL HE KNEW WE WERE WATCHING HIM AND MADE SUNDRY MOUTHS
6437-66173-0002 AND SCOWLED IN THE MOST THREATENING WAY OVER HIS SUMS CONWAY HAD AN ACCOMPLISHMENT PECULIARLY HIS OWN THAT OF THROWING HIS THUMBS OUT OF JOINT AT WILL SOMETIMES WHILE ABSORBED IN STUDY OR ON BECOMING NERVOUS AT RECITATION
6437-66173-0004 BUT THE INTERMISSION PASSED OFF TRANQUILLY SOMEWHAT TO OUR DISAPPOINTMENT AT THE CLOSE OF THE AFTERNOON SESSION IT HAPPENED THAT BINNY WALLACE AND MYSELF HAVING GOT SWAMPED IN OUR LATIN EXERCISE
6437-66173-0005 WERE DETAINED IN SCHOOL FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFRESHING OUR MEMORIES WITH A PAGE OF MISTER ANDREWS'S PERPLEXING IRREGULAR VERBS BINNY WALLACE FINISHING HIS TASK FIRST WAS DISMISSED I FOLLOWED SHORTLY AFTER
6437-66173-0007 BUT ON SEEING ME SWEEP ACROSS THE YARD WHIRLING MY STRAP OF BOOKS IN THE AIR LIKE A SLING HE CALLED OUT LUSTILY LAY LOW CONWAY HERE'S YOUNG BAILEY CONWAY TURNED JUST IN TIME TO CATCH ON HIS SHOULDER THE BLOW INTENDED FOR HIS HEAD
6437-66173-0008 HE REACHED FORWARD ONE OF HIS LONG ARMS HE HAD ARMS LIKE A WINDMILL THAT BOY AND GRASPING ME BY THE HAIR TORE OUT QUITE A RESPECTABLE HANDFUL THE TEARS FLEW TO MY EYES
6437-66173-0010 AND KEEPING MY EYE FIXED STEADILY ON CONWAY'S IN ALL OF WHICH I WAS FAITHFULLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS OF PHIL ADAMS WHOSE FATHER SUBSCRIBED TO A SPORTING JOURNAL CONWAY ALSO THREW HIMSELF INTO A DEFENSIVE ATTITUDE
6437-66173-0011 AND THERE WE WERE GLARING AT EACH OTHER MOTIONLESS NEITHER OF US DISPOSED TO RISK AN ATTACK BUT BOTH ON THE ALERT TO RESIST ONE THERE IS NO TELLING HOW LONG WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED IN THAT ABSURD POSITION HAD WE NOT BEEN INTERRUPTED
6437-66173-0013 THE BOYS FELL BACK PERFORCE ON THE SCHOOL YARD JUST AT THIS CRISIS A DOZEN OR SO OF THE TEMPLARS ENTERED THE GATE AND SEEING AT A GLANCE THE BELLIGERENT STATUS OF CONWAY AND MYSELF DROPPED BAT AND BALL AND RUSHED TO THE SPOT WHERE WE STOOD
6437-66173-0014 IS IT A FIGHT ASKED PHIL ADAMS WHO SAW BY OUR FRESHNESS THAT WE HAD NOT YET GOT TO WORK YES IT'S A FIGHT I ANSWERED UNLESS CONWAY WILL ASK WALLACE'S PARDON PROMISE NEVER TO HECTOR ME IN FUTURE
6437-66173-0016 RODGERS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS YOUR SECOND CONWAY BAILEY COME HERE WHAT'S THE ROW ABOUT HE WAS THRASHING BINNY WALLACE NO I WASN'T INTERRUPTED CONWAY
6437-66173-0017 BUT I WAS GOING TO BECAUSE HE KNOWS WHO PUT MEEKS'S MORTAR OVER OUR DOOR AND I KNOW WELL ENOUGH WHO DID IT IT WAS THAT SNEAKING LITTLE MULATTER POINTING AT ME O BY GEORGE I CRIED REDDENING AT THE INSULT
6437-66173-0019 MUTTERED PHIL TWITCHING THE HANDKERCHIEF TO ASCERTAIN IF IT WERE SECURELY TIED HE THEN LOOSENED MY GALLOWSES BRACES AND BUCKLED THEM TIGHTLY ABOVE MY HIPS NOW THEN BANTAM NEVER SAY DIE
6437-66173-0020 CONWAY REGARDED THESE BUSINESS LIKE PREPARATIONS WITH EVIDENT MISGIVING FOR HE CALLED RODGERS TO HIS SIDE AND HAD HIMSELF ARRAYED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THOUGH HIS HAIR WAS CROPPED SO CLOSE THAT YOU COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN HOLD OF IT WITH A PAIR OF TWEEZERS
6437-66173-0022 AND YOU'LL HAVE THE SUN IN HIS EYES BEHOLD US ONCE MORE FACE TO FACE LIKE DAVID AND THE PHILISTINE LOOK AT US AS LONG AS YOU MAY FOR THIS IS ALL YOU SHALL SEE OF THE COMBAT
6437-66173-0023 ACCORDING TO MY THINKING THE HOSPITAL TEACHES A BETTER LESSON THAN THE BATTLE FIELD I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT MY BLACK EYE AND MY SWOLLEN LIP IF YOU WILL BUT NOT A WORD OF THE FIGHT
6437-66173-0025 I MIGHT HAVE SHIELDED MYSELF BY APPEALING TO MISTER GRIMSHAW BUT NO BOY IN THE TEMPLE GRAMMAR SCHOOL COULD DO THAT WITHOUT LOSING CASTE WHETHER THIS WAS JUST OR NOT DOESN'T MATTER A PIN SINCE IT WAS SO A TRADITIONARY LAW OF THE PLACE
6437-66173-0026 THE PERSONAL INCONVENIENCE I SUFFERED FROM MY TORMENTOR WAS NOTHING TO THE PAIN HE INFLICTED ON ME INDIRECTLY BY HIS PERSISTENT CRUELTY TO LITTLE BINNY WALLACE I SHOULD HAVE LACKED THE SPIRIT OF A HEN IF I HAD NOT RESENTED IT FINALLY
6437-66173-0028 THE OCCASION MAY COME ROUND WHEN A DECENT PROFICIENCY IN ONE OR THE REST OF THESE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WILL BE OF SERVICE TO YOU IN ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS
6437-66173-0029 EVER WRITTEN FOR BOYS ARE THESE WORDS LEARN TO BOX THEN AS YOU LEARN TO PLAY CRICKET AND FOOTBALL NOT ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WORSE BUT VERY MUCH THE BETTER FOR LEARNING TO BOX WELL
6437-66173-0031 IT'S QUITE RIGHT AND JUSTIFIABLE IF DONE FROM A SIMPLE AVERSION TO PHYSICAL PAIN AND DANGER BUT DON'T SAY NO BECAUSE YOU FEAR A LICKING AND SAY OR THINK IT'S BECAUSE YOU FEAR GOD FOR THAT'S NEITHER CHRISTIAN NOR HONEST AND IF YOU DO FIGHT
6437-66173-0032 FIGHT IT OUT AND DON'T GIVE IN WHILE YOU CAN STAND AND SEE AND DON'T GIVE IN WHEN YOU CAN'T SEE FOR I COULD STAND VERY LITTLE AND SEE NOT AT ALL HAVING POMMELLED THE SCHOOL PUMP FOR THE LAST TWENTY SECONDS
6437-66173-0034 CONVINCED OF MY ERROR I ACCEPTED HIS CONGRATULATIONS WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER BOYS BLANDLY AND BLINDLY I REMEMBER THAT BINNY WALLACE WANTED TO GIVE ME HIS SILVER PENCIL CASE
6437-66173-0035 THE GENTLE SOUL HAD STOOD THROUGHOUT THE CONTEST WITH HIS FACE TURNED TO THE FENCE SUFFERING UNTOLD AGONY
6437-66173-0037 I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ONLY FOLLOWING MY NOSE BUT FOLLOWING IT SO CLOSELY THAT I WAS IN SOME DANGER OF TREADING ON IT I SEEMED TO HAVE NOSE ENOUGH FOR THE WHOLE PARTY MY LEFT CHEEK ALSO WAS PUFFED OUT LIKE A DUMPLING
6437-66173-0038 I COULDN'T HELP SAYING TO MYSELF IF THIS IS VICTORY HOW ABOUT THAT OTHER FELLOW TOM SAID HARRY BLAKE HESITATING WELL
6437-66173-0040 SHOULDN'T WONDER NO HE DIDN'T BROKE IN ADAMS OR HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT SHORT METRE
6437-66173-0041 WELL IT CAN'T BE HELPED NOW I REFLECTED AS THE MONKEY SAID WHEN HE FELL OUT OF THE COCOANUT TREE ADDED CHARLEY MARDEN TRYING TO MAKE ME LAUGH IT WAS EARLY CANDLE LIGHT WHEN WE REACHED THE HOUSE
6437-66173-0043 PRODUCED AN EXPRESSION OF WHICH MISS ABIGAIL DECLARED SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THE LIKE EXCEPTING ON THE FACE OF A CHINESE IDOL SHE HUSTLED ME UNCEREMONIOUSLY INTO THE PRESENCE OF MY GRANDFATHER IN THE SITTING ROOM
6437-66173-0044 CAPTAIN NUTTER AS THE RECOGNIZED PROFESSIONAL WARRIOR OF OUR FAMILY COULD NOT CONSISTENTLY TAKE ME TO TASK FOR FIGHTING CONWAY NOR WAS HE DISPOSED TO DO SO
6437-66173-0046 I BELIEVE IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY I THINK SAID MISS ABIGAIL WITHOUT THE FAINTEST EXPRESSION ON HER COUNTENANCE THAT A TABLE SPOONFUL OF HOT DRO THE CAPTAIN INTERRUPTED MISS ABIGAIL PEREMPTORILY
6437-66173-0047 DIRECTING HER TO MAKE A SHADE OUT OF CARDBOARD AND BLACK SILK TO TIE OVER MY EYE MISS ABIGAIL MUST HAVE BEEN POSSESSED WITH THE IDEA THAT I HAD TAKEN UP PUGILISM AS A PROFESSION FOR SHE TURNED OUT NO FEWER THAN SIX OF THESE BLINDERS
6437-66173-0049 HE HAD AS WE SUSPECTED WITNESSED THE CLOSING SCENE OF THE FIGHT FROM THE SCHOOL ROOM WINDOW AND THE NEXT MORNING AFTER PRAYERS I WAS NOT WHOLLY UNPREPARED WHEN MASTER CONWAY AND MYSELF WERE CALLED UP TO THE DESK FOR EXAMINATION
6437-66173-0050 AS THE READER IS ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH THE LEADING POINTS IN THE CASE OF BAILEY VERSUS CONWAY I SHALL NOT REPORT THE TRIAL FURTHER THAN TO SAY THAT ADAMS MARDEN AND SEVERAL OTHER PUPILS TESTIFIED TO THE FACT
6437-66173-0052 PROVED THAT I HAD STRUCK THE FIRST BLOW THAT WAS BAD FOR ME IF YOU PLEASE SIR SAID BINNY WALLACE HOLDING UP HIS HAND FOR PERMISSION TO SPEAK BAILEY DIDN'T FIGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT HE FOUGHT ON MY ACCOUNT AND IF YOU PLEASE SIR
6437-66173-0053 I AM THE BOY TO BE BLAMED FOR I WAS THE CAUSE OF THE TROUBLE THIS DREW OUT THE STORY OF CONWAY'S HARSH TREATMENT OF THE SMALLER BOYS AS BINNY RELATED THE WRONGS OF HIS PLAYFELLOWS SAYING VERY LITTLE OF HIS OWN GRIEVANCES
6437-66173-0055 EVERY BOY IN THIS SCHOOL KNOWS THAT IT IS AGAINST THE RULES TO FIGHT IF ONE BOY MALTREATS ANOTHER WITHIN SCHOOL BOUNDS OR WITHIN SCHOOL HOURS THAT IS A MATTER FOR ME TO SETTLE THE CASE SHOULD BE LAID BEFORE ME
6437-66173-0056 I DISAPPROVE OF TALE BEARING I NEVER ENCOURAGE IT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE BUT WHEN ONE PUPIL SYSTEMATICALLY PERSECUTES A SCHOOLMATE IT IS THE DUTY OF SOME HEAD BOY TO INFORM ME NO PUPIL HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS
6437-66173-0058 BUT AS THE OFFENCE IS ONE OF OMISSION RATHER THAN COMMISSION MY PUNISHMENT MUST REST ONLY ON THE TWO BOYS CONVICTED OF MISDEMEANOR CONWAY LOSES HIS RECESS FOR A MONTH AND BAILEY HAS A PAGE ADDED TO HIS LATIN LESSONS FOR THE NEXT FOUR RECITATIONS
6437-66173-0059 I NOW REQUEST BAILEY AND CONWAY TO SHAKE HANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL AND ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR REGRET AT WHAT HAS OCCURRED CONWAY AND I APPROACHED EACH OTHER SLOWLY AND CAUTIOUSLY AS IF WE WERE BENT UPON ANOTHER HOSTILE COLLISION
6437-66173-0061 YOU CAN GO TO YOUR SEATS SAID MISTER GRIMSHAW TURNING HIS FACE ASIDE TO HIDE A SMILE I AM SURE MY APOLOGY WAS A VERY GOOD ONE I NEVER HAD ANY MORE TROUBLE WITH CONWAY
6437-66173-0062 HE AND HIS SHADOW SETH RODGERS GAVE ME A WIDE BERTH FOR MANY MONTHS NOR WAS BINNY WALLACE SUBJECTED TO FURTHER MOLESTATION MISS ABIGAIL'S SANITARY STORES INCLUDING A BOTTLE OF OPODELDOC WERE NEVER CALLED INTO REQUISITION
6454-93938-0001 SEEING THROUGH THE DEVICE THE PARTY HAD AT ONCE GONE TO THIS RANCH WHERE THE OWNER BALDWIN MOUNTED THEM AND IT WAS THEIR DUST CLOUD WE HAD SEEN AS THEY RODE UP TO ASH FORKS
6454-93938-0002 TO MAKE MATTERS MORE SERIOUS BALDWIN HAD ROUNDED UP HIS COWBOYS AND BROUGHT THEM ALONG WITH HIM IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY RESISTANCE IMPOSSIBLE I MADE NO OBJECTION TO THE SHERIFF SERVING THE PAPER
6454-93938-0004 AND ANSWERED THAT I ASKED AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE CASE SO THAT I MIGHT BE HEARD BY COUNSEL IT WAS DENIED AS WAS TO HAVE BEEN EXPECTED INDEED WHY THEY TOOK THE TROUBLE TO GO THROUGH THE FORMS WAS BEYOND ME
6454-93938-0005 I TOLD WILSON I SHOULD NOT PRODUCE THE LETTERS AND HE ASKED IF I KNEW WHAT THAT MEANT I COULDN'T HELP LAUGHING AND RETORTING IT VERY APPROPRIATELY MEANS CONTEMPT OF THE COURT YOUR HONOR
6454-93938-0007 ON THE NIGHT OF OCTOBER FOURTEENTH AND ASK THAT HE BE TAKEN INTO CUSTODY ON THAT CHARGE I COULDN'T MAKE OUT THIS NEW MOVE AND PUZZLED OVER IT WHILE JUDGE WILSON ORDERED MY COMMITMENT
6454-93938-0008 BUT THE NEXT STEP REVEALED THE OBJECT FOR THE LAWYER THEN ASKED FOR A SEARCH WARRANT TO LOOK FOR STOLEN PROPERTY THE JUDGE WAS EQUALLY OBLIGING AND BEGAN TO FILL ONE OUT ON THE INSTANT
6454-93938-0010 THERE WEREN'T MANY MOMENTS IN WHICH TO THINK WHILE THE JUDGE SCRIBBLED AWAY AT THE WARRANT BUT IN WHAT TIME THERE WAS I DID A LOT OF HEAD WORK WITHOUT HOWEVER FINDING MORE THAN ONE WAY OUT OF THE SNARL
6454-93938-0011 AND WHEN I SAW THE JUDGE FINISH OFF HIS SIGNATURE WITH A FLOURISH I PLAYED A PRETTY DESPERATE CARD YOU'RE JUST TOO LATE GENTLEMEN I SAID POINTING OUT THE SIDE WINDOW OF THE SALOON THERE COME THE CAVALRY
6454-93938-0013 AS HE DID SO I GAVE HIM A SHOVE TOWARDS THE THREE WHICH SENT THEM ALL SPRAWLING ON THE FLOOR IN A PRETTY BADLY MIXED UP CONDITION I MADE A DASH FOR THE DOOR AND AS I WENT THROUGH IT
6454-93938-0014 I GRABBED THE KEY AND LOCKED THEM IN WHEN I TURNED TO DO SO I SAW THE LOT STRUGGLING UP FROM THE FLOOR AND KNOWING THAT IT WOULDN'T TAKE THEM MANY SECONDS TO FIND THEIR WAY OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW
6454-93938-0016 I GAVE TWO OF THE PONIES SLAPS WHICH STARTED THEM OFF AT A LOPE ACROSS THE RAILROAD TRACKS I SWUNG MYSELF INTO THE SADDLE OF THE THIRD AND FLICKED HIM WITH THE LOOSE ENDS OF THE BRIDLE IN A WAY WHICH MADE HIM UNDERSTAND THAT I MEANT BUSINESS
6454-93938-0017 AND CONSIDERING THAT HE HAD COVERED OVER FORTY MILES THAT AFTERNOON IN PRETTY QUICK TIME IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT THERE WASN'T VERY MUCH GO LEFT IN HIM
6454-93938-0019 BUT I LOST SIGHT OF THEM THE NEXT MOMENT AS SOON AS I REACHED A STREET LEADING BACK TO THE RAILROAD I TURNED AGAIN AND RODE TOWARDS IT MY ONE THOUGHT BEING TO GET BACK IF POSSIBLE TO THE STATION
6454-93938-0020 AND PUT THE LETTERS INTO THE RAILROAD AGENT'S SAFE WHEN I REACHED THE MAIN STREET I SAW THAT MY HOPE WAS FUTILE FOR ANOTHER BATCH OF COWBOYS WERE COMING IN FULL GALLOP TOWARDS ME VERY THOROUGHLY HEADING ME OFF IN THAT DIRECTION
6454-93938-0022 IN EXPECTATION OF HEARING THE SHOOTING BEGIN AND TO KNOW THAT ANY MOMENT MAY BE YOUR LAST I DON'T SUPPOSE I WAS ON THE RAGGED EDGE MORE THAN THIRTY SECONDS BUT THEY WERE ENOUGH TO PROVE TO ME THAT
6454-93938-0023 TO KEEP ONE'S BACK TURNED TO AN ENEMY AS ONE RUNS AWAY TAKES A DEAL MORE PLUCK THAN TO STAND UP AND FACE HIS GUN FORTUNATELY FOR ME MY PURSUERS FELT SO SURE OF MY CAPTURE
6454-93938-0025 AS I DID SO I REALIZED THAT TO DESTROY UNITED STATES MAIL NOT MERELY ENTAILED CRIMINAL LIABILITY BUT WAS OFF COLOR MORALLY I FALTERED
6454-93938-0026 BALANCING THE OUTWITTING OF CAMP AGAINST STATE'S PRISON THE DOING MY BEST FOR MADGE AGAINST THE WRONG OF IT I THINK I'M AS HONEST A FELLOW AS THE AVERAGE BUT I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I COULDN'T DECIDE TO DO RIGHT
6454-93938-0028 THIS PUT ME OUT OF VIEW OF MY PURSUERS FOR A MOMENT AND IN THAT INSTANT I STOOD UP IN MY STIRRUPS LIFTED THE BROAD LEATHER FLAP OF THE SADDLE AND TUCKED THE LETTERS UNDERNEATH IT AS FAR IN AS I COULD FORCE THEM
6454-93938-0029 IT WAS A DESPERATE PLACE IN WHICH TO HIDE THEM BUT THE GAME WAS A DESPERATE ONE AT BEST AND THE VERY BOLDNESS OF THE IDEA MIGHT BE ITS BEST CHANCE OF SUCCESS
6454-93938-0031 THAT I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT FRED WAS DUE THE MOMENT I SAW HIM I RODE TOWARDS HIM PRESSING MY PONY FOR ALL HE WAS WORTH MY HOPE WAS THAT I MIGHT GET TIME TO GIVE FRED THE TIP AS TO WHERE THE LETTERS WERE
6454-93938-0032 BUT BEFORE I WAS WITHIN SPEAKING DISTANCE BALDWIN CAME RUNNING OUT FROM BEHIND THE STATION AND SEEING ME TURNED CALLED BACK AND GESTICULATED EVIDENTLY TO SUMMON SOME COWBOYS TO HEAD ME OFF
6454-93938-0034 INTENDING TO RIDE UP AND RUN INTO MY CAR FOR I KNEW THAT THE PAPERS IN MY HAND WOULD BE TAKEN TO BE THE WANTED LETTERS AND THAT IF I COULD ONLY GET INSIDE THE CAR EVEN FOR A MOMENT THE SUSPICION WOULD BE THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO HIDE THEM
6454-93938-0035 HIDE THEM FRED WAS QUICK AS A FLASH AND GRABBING THEM OFF THE GROUND SPRANG UP THE STEPS OF MY CAR AND RAN INSIDE JUST ESCAPING A BULLET FROM MY PURSUERS
6454-107462-0001 FOR BEING FULL OF THE SOUR CREAM OF AN INHUMAN CURIOSITY HIS CURIOSITY HOWEVER DID NOT EXTEND ITSELF TO SCIENCE
6454-107462-0002 AT FIRST WHEN DEASEY RETIRED FROM THE POLICE FORCE WITH A PENSION AND AN HEIRESS WITH THREE HUNDRED POUNDS AND TIME HUNG HEAVY ON HIS HANDS HE WOULD TRY TO SATISFY THIS CRAVING THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF A HOST OF SMALL
6454-107462-0004 FOR WHOM THE BOTTLES AT THE PRESBYTERY WENT IN BY THE BACK DOOR AND WHAT WAS THE REAL CAUSE OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE TWIN MISS MC INERNEYS BUT THESE WERE BUT BLACKBIRD SCRATCHINGS AS IT WERE
6454-107462-0005 UPON THE DEEP SOIL OF THE HUMAN HEART WHAT DEASEY CARED ABOUT WAS WHAT HE CALLED THE SECRETS OF THE SOUL NEVER MET A MAN HE WAS WONT TO SAY WITH NO BACKSTAIRS TO HIS MIND
6454-107462-0007 HE WOULD GENTLY CLOSE THE DOOR OF THE BAR PARLOUR PICK UP A TUMBLER BREATHE ON IT POLISH THE BREATH LEAN ONE ELBOW ON THE BAR LOOK ROUND HIM ONCE AGAIN
6454-107462-0008 AND SETTING THE WHISKY BOTTLE BETWIXT HIS CUSTOMER AND HIMSELF WITH A NOD WHICH SAID HELP YOURSELF HE WOULD LEAN FORWARD WITH THE SOFT INDULGENT GRIN OF THE HUMAN MAN OF THE WORLD AND BEGIN NOW
6454-107462-0010 INCRIMINATING FACTS OR CERTAIN LETTERS HE WOULD RING THE CHANGES ON THESE THREE ACCORDING TO THE SEX AND TEMPERAMENT WITH WHICH HE HAD TO DEAL
6454-107462-0011 BUT ALWAYS WHATEVER THE WORDS WHATEVER THE NATURE OR SEX THE SHOT WOULD TELL FIRST CAME THE LITTLE START THE STRAIGHTENED FIGURE THE PALLOR OR FLUSH
6454-107462-0013 DEASEY WOULD MAKE REPLY BUT TWAS FROM A CERTAIN PERSON WHOM PERHAPS WE NEED NOT NAME THEN THE WHISKEY BOTTLE WOULD MOVE FORWARD LIKE A PAWN IN CHESS AND THE NEXT SOOTHING WORDS WOULD BE
6454-107462-0014 AND YOUR SECRET IS SAFE WITH ME FORTHWITH THE LITTLE SKELETON IN THAT MAN'S CUPBOARD WOULD LEAN FORWARD AND PRESS UPON THE DOOR UNTIL AT LAST THE DOOR FLEW OPEN AND A BONE OR TWO
6454-107462-0016 UNDER THE THREE HEADS INTO WHICH HE HAD DIVIDED THEM THOSE WHO DEMANDED WITH VIOLENT THREATS WHICH MELTED LIKE SNOW BEFORE THE SUNSHINE OF JOHN JAMIESON THE LETTER OR THE NAME OF THE INFORMANT
6454-107462-0017 THOSE WHO ASKED AFTER A GENTLE SIP OR TWO HOW THE LETTER HAD COME INTO HIS HANDS AND THOSE WHO ASKED IMMEDIATELY IF THE LETTER HADN'T BEEN DESTROYED AS A RULE FROM THE TYPE THAT DEMANDED THE LETTER BACK
6454-107462-0019 BUT THOSE WHO ASKED BETWEEN PENSIVE SIPS HOW THE FACTS OR THE LETTER HAD COME HIS WAY THESE WERE THE ONES WHO YIELDED DEASEY THE RICHEST HARVEST OF RATTLING SKELETON BONES
6454-107462-0020 INDEED IT WAS CURIOUSLY INSTRUCTIVE HOW JOHN JAMIESON LAID DOWN A CAUSEWAY OF GLEAMING STEPPING STONES SO THAT DEASEY MIGHT CROSS LIGHTLY OVER THE TURGID WATERS OF HIS VICTIMS SOULS
6454-107462-0022 AND GNOMES WHICH HAD BEEN LOCKED AWAY IN DARKNESS MAYBE THIS MANY A YEAR WELL HOW WOULD I GET THE TIME TO CLANE THE CHILDER AND TO WASH THEIR HEADS AND I WORKING ALL THE DAY AT CURING STINKIN HIDES
6454-107462-0023 AND HE FELL OVER ON THE SIDE AND BUSTED ALL HIS VEINS OR WELL AN WOULDN'T YOU DRAW TWO PINSIONS YOURSELF MISTER DEASEY IF YOU'D A WIFE WITH TWO HAN'S LIKE A SIEVE FOR YELLOW GOLD
6454-107462-0025 TO MY PLACE AND I DROPPED IT DOWN THE WELL THEY FOUND IT WHEN THEY LET THE BUCKET DOWN BUT I WASN'T HIS ACCOMPLICE AT ALL TWAS ONLY CONNIVANCE WITH ME WHEN HE HAD SPOKEN OF THE CHIMNEY AND THE WELL
6454-107462-0026 DEASEY CONCLUDED AT ONCE IT WAS A FOULLY MURDERED CORPSE BUT THEN AGAIN YOU COULD NOT WELL CONCEAL A CORPSE IN SOMEONE'S WAISTCOAT AND GOLD COINS WOULD MELT OR BE MISLAID AMONGST THE LOOSE BRICKS OF A SOOTY CHIMNEY
6454-107462-0028 TO THE FIRST UNVARYING WORDS BUT ALL THAT IS NOW PAST AND OVER AND SAFE BENEATH THE MOULDERING CLAY AT THESE LAST WORDS THE WIDOW GERAGHTY KNEW WELL THE BARRIER WAS DOWN
6454-107462-0029 THAT FENCES OFF ONE HUMAN SOUL FROM ANOTHER ALL THE SAME SHE SHOOK HER TREMBLING HEAD WHEN DEASEY DREW THE CORK AT HER REFUSAL DEASEY WAS STRUCK WITH THE MOST RESPECTFUL COMPASSION
6454-107462-0031 NO MA'AM RETURNED DEASEY TO LOOK AT YOU YE'D THINK MA'AM YE COULD NEVER KILL A FLY AND RESPECTFULLY HE PASSED THE PEPPERMINTS SOMETIMES THE WIDOW MUTTERED I HEARS IT
6454-107462-0032 AND THE TWO BRIGHT EYES OF IT AND THE LITTLE CLAY COLD FEET DEASEY KNEW WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND HE TWITCHED IN EVERY VEIN AND SHE SO WHITE HAIRED AND SO REGULAR AT CHURCH
6454-107462-0034 BUT I HAD BAD TEETH IN ME HEAD AND I COULDN'T GET MY REST WITH THE JAWS ACHING AND ALL THE WHILES IT SCREECHING WITH THE CROUP TWOULD MADDEN YOU ALL THE SAME DEASEY WHISPERED
6454-107462-0035 MAYBE IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT TWAS MAYBE YOUR MAN EGGED YOU ON TO DO THE SHAMEFUL DEED
6454-107462-0037 THIS TOUCH OF THE GREY FEET LAID A SPELL ON DEASEY'S HANKERING MORBIDITY WHAT TURNED THE FEET GREY HE WHISPERED
6454-120342-0000 OURS ARE NOT THE CAROLLINGS OF YOUR POOR SHIVERING LITTLE EAST ANGLES OR SOUTH MERCIANS WHERE THEY HAVE TO PLOD ROUND AFOOT IN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT A SLEIGH RIDE IS
6454-120342-0002 SHOULD BREAK UP THE SPREE BEFORE IT BEGAN THEN I HAD TOLD HOWLAND THAT HE MUST RESERVE FOR ME A SPAN OF GOOD HORSES AND A SLEIGH THAT I COULD PACK SIXTEEN SMALL CHILDREN INTO TIGHT STOWED
6454-120342-0003 HOWLAND IS ALWAYS GOOD ABOUT SUCH THINGS KNEW WHAT THE SLEIGH WAS FOR HAVING DONE THE SAME IN OTHER YEARS AND DOUBLED THE SPAN OF HORSES OF HIS OWN ACCORD BECAUSE THE CHILDREN WOULD LIKE IT BETTER AND IT WOULD BE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
6454-120342-0005 AND SO TUESDAY NIGHT THE METROPOLITAN PEOPLE GAVE UP THEIR UNEQUAL CONTEST ALL GOOD MEN AND ANGELS REJOICING AT THEIR DISCOMFITURE AND ONLY A FEW OF THE PEOPLE IN THE VERY LOWEST BOLGIE BEING ILL NATURED ENOUGH TO GRIEVE
6454-120342-0006 AND WITHOUT FATIGUE TO HORSE OR MAN SO IT WAS THAT WHEN I CAME DOWN WITH LYCIDAS TO THE CHAPEL AT SEVEN O'CLOCK I FOUND HARRY HAD GATHERED THERE HIS EIGHT PRETTY GIRLS AND HIS EIGHT JOLLY BOYS
6454-120342-0008 OR PERHAPS HARRY HAD HINTED IT TO THEIR MOTHERS CERTAINLY THEY WERE WARMLY DRESSED AND WHEN FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS HOWLAND CAME ROUND HIMSELF WITH THE SLEIGH HE HAD PUT IN AS MANY RUGS AND BEAR SKINS
6454-120342-0009 AS IF HE THOUGHT THE CHILDREN WERE TO BE TAKEN NEW BORN FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE CRADLES GREAT WAS THE REJOICING AS THE BELLS OF THE HORSES RANG BENEATH THE CHAPEL WINDOWS AND HARRY DID NOT GET HIS LAST DA CAPO FOR HIS LAST CAROL
6454-120342-0011 THERE CAN BE NOTHING BETTER THAN TWO OR THREE SUCH HOURS FIRST DRIVER OUT ON COMMONWEALTH AVENUE THAT WILL TONE DOWN THE HORSES STOP ON THE LEFT AFTER YOU HAVE PASSED FAIRFIELD STREET
6454-120342-0012 SO WE DASHED UP TO THE FRONT OF HALIBURTON'S PALACE WHERE HE WAS KEEPING HIS FIRST CHRISTMAS TIDE AND THE CHILDREN WHOM HARRY HAD HUSHED DOWN FOR A SQUARE OR TWO BROKE FORTH WITH GOOD FULL VOICE UNDER HIS STRONG LEAD IN
6454-120342-0014 IN AN INSTANT MORE WE SAW HALIBURTON AND ANNA RUN TO THE WINDOW AND PULL UP THE SHADES AND IN A MINUTE MORE FACES AT ALL THE WINDOWS AND SO THE CHILDREN SUNG THROUGH CLEMENT'S OLD HYMN
6454-120342-0015 LITTLE DID CLEMENT THINK OF BELLS AND SNOW AS HE TAUGHT IT IN HIS SUNDAY SCHOOL THERE IN ALEXANDRIA BUT PERHAPS TO DAY AS THEY PIN UP THE LAURELS AND THE PALM IN THE CHAPEL AT ALEXANDRIA
6454-120342-0017 HALIBURTON CAME RUNNING OUT AND BEGGED ME TO BRING THEM IN BUT I TOLD HIM NO AS SOON AS I COULD HUSH THEIR SHOUTS OF MERRY CHRISTMAS THAT WE HAD A LONG JOURNEY BEFORE US AND MUST NOT ALIGHT BY THE WAY
6454-120342-0018 AND THE CHILDREN BROKE OUT WITH HAIL TO THE NIGHT HAIL TO THE DAY RATHER A FAVORITE QUICKER AND MORE TO THE CHILDISH TASTE PERHAPS THAN THE OTHER AND WITH ANOTHER MERRY CHRISTMAS WE WERE OFF AGAIN
6454-120342-0020 KISSES FLUNG FROM THE WINDOW KISSES FLUNG BACK FROM THE STREET MERRY CHRISTMAS AGAIN WITH A GOOD WILL AND THEN ONE OF THE GIRLS BEGAN WHEN ANNA TOOK THE BABY AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO HERS
6454-120342-0021 AND ALL OF THEM FELL IN SO CHEERILY O DEAR ME IT IS A SCRAP OF OLD EPHREM THE SYRIAN IF THEY DID BUT KNOW IT AND WHEN AFTER THIS HARRY WOULD FAIN HAVE DRIVEN ON
6454-120342-0023 AND THEN UP THE HILL AND OVER TO THE NORTH END AND AS FAR AS WE COULD GET THE HORSES UP INTO MOON COURT THAT THEY MIGHT SING TO THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN WHO GAVE LUCY THE BOY AND DOG IN PLASTER
6454-120342-0024 THOUGH CHRYSOSTOM SHOULD HAVE MADE A FEW REMARKS TO THEM SEVENTEEN TIMES IN THE CHAPEL THEN THE ITALIAN IMAGE MAN HEARD FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE NOW IS THE TIME OF CHRISTMAS COME AND
6454-120342-0026 AND SO DOWN STATE STREET AND STOPPED AT THE ADVERTISER OFFICE BECAUSE WHEN THE BOYS GAVE THEIR LITERARY ENTERTAINMENT MISTER HALE PUT IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT FOR NOTHING AND UP IN THE OLD ATTIC THERE
6454-120342-0027 AND THE IN GENERAL MAN FROM HIS MORE SERIOUS VIEWS AND THE DAILY THE NEXT MORNING WISHED EVERYBODY A MERRY CHRISTMAS WITH EVEN MORE UNCTION AND RESOLVED THAT IN COMING YEARS IT WOULD HAVE A SUPPLEMENT
6454-120342-0029 TO THE PALACES OF MILLIONNAIRES WHO HAD PRAYED FOR THESE CHILDREN WITH TEARS IF THE CHILDREN ONLY KNEW IT TO DOCTOR FROTHINGHAM'S IN SUMMER STREET I REMEMBER WHERE WE STOPPED BECAUSE THE BOSTON ASSOCIATION OF MINISTERS MET THERE
6454-120342-0030 AND OUT ON DOVER STREET BRIDGE THAT THE POOR CHAIR MENDER MIGHT HEAR OUR CAROLS SUNG ONCE MORE BEFORE HE HEARD THEM BETTER SUNG IN ANOTHER WORLD WHERE NOTHING NEEDS MENDING
6454-120342-0032 AND ALL THE OTHERS RUNG OUT WITH ORDER OR WITHOUT ORDER BREAKING THE HUSH DIRECTLY AS THE HORSES BELLS WERE STILLED THROWN INTO THE AIR WITH ALL THE GLADNESS OF CHILDHOOD
6454-120342-0033 EVERYWHERE A LITTLE CROWD GATHERED ROUND US AND THEN WE DASHED AWAY FAR ENOUGH TO GATHER QUITE ANOTHER CROWD AND THEN BACK PERHAPS NOT SORRY TO DOUBLE ON OUR STEPS IF NEED WERE AND LEAVING EVERY CROWD WITH A HAPPY THOUGHT OF
6454-120342-0035 BEGGED THAT THEY MIGHT STAY TILL THE LAST MOMENT THEY COULD WALK BACK FROM THE STABLE AND RATHER WALK THAN NOT INDEED
6476-57446-0000 BUT IN THE MIDST OF GAIETY HIS HEART YEARNED ALL THE WHILE FOR HIS LOST LOVE AND HIS MERRIMENT WAS BUT MOURNING IN DISGUISE AT LAST THE NIGHT WORE ON AND AS HE WAS RETIRING ALONG THE CORRIDOR HE SAW A MAN OF ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
6476-57446-0002 LOOKING AT THE MAN ATTENTIVELY RECOGNIZED HIM AS A RETAINER WHOM HE HAD HAD IN HIS EMPLOY THE YEAR BEFORE AND SAID THIS IS A CURIOUS MEETING PRAY WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN ABOUT SINCE YOU LEFT MY SERVICE AT ANY RATE
6476-57446-0003 I MAY CONGRATULATE YOU ON BEING WELL AND STRONG WHERE ARE YOU LIVING NOW WELL SIR SINCE I PARTED FROM YOU I HAVE BEEN EARNING A LIVING AS A FORTUNE TELLER AT KANDA AND HAVE CHANGED MY NAME TO KAJI SAZEN
6476-57446-0005 SHALL YOU BE AT HOME THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW CERTAINLY SIR I SHALL MAKE A POINT OF BEING AT HOME VERY WELL THEN THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW I WILL GO TO YOUR HOUSE I SHALL BE AT YOUR SERVICE SIR AND NOW AS IT IS GETTING LATE
6476-57446-0006 I WILL TAKE MY LEAVE FOR TO NIGHT GOOD NIGHT THEN WE SHALL MEET THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW AND SO THE TWO PARTED AND WENT THEIR SEVERAL WAYS TO REST ON THE APPOINTED DAY GENZABURO MADE HIS PREPARATIONS AND WENT IN DISGUISE WITHOUT ANY RETAINERS
6476-57446-0008 PRAY REPLIED GENZABURO DON'T MAKE ANY CEREMONY FOR ME DON'T PUT YOURSELF TO ANY TROUBLE ON MY ACCOUNT AND SO HE PASSED IN AND SAZEN CALLED TO HIS WIFE TO PREPARE WINE AND CONDIMENTS AND THEY BEGAN TO FEAST
6476-57446-0009 AT LAST GENZABURO LOOKING SAZEN IN THE FACE SAID THERE IS A SERVICE WHICH I WANT YOU TO RENDER ME A VERY SECRET SERVICE BUT AS IF YOU WERE TO REFUSE ME I SHOULD BE PUT TO SHAME BEFORE I TELL YOU WHAT THAT SERVICE IS
6476-57446-0011 HOW HE HAD FIRST MET HER AND FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER AT THE ADZUMA BRIDGE HOW CHOKICHI HAD INTRODUCED HER TO HIM AT THE TEA HOUSE AT OJI AND THEN WHEN SHE FELL ILL AND HE WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN INSTEAD OF BRINGING HER TO HIM HAD ONLY GIVEN HIM GOOD ADVICE
6476-57446-0012 AND SO GENZABURO DREW A LAMENTABLE PICTURE OF HIS STATE OF DESPAIR SAZEN LISTENED PATIENTLY TO HIS STORY AND AFTER REFLECTING FOR A WHILE REPLIED WELL SIR IT'S NOT A DIFFICULT MATTER TO SET RIGHT
6476-57446-0014 LAID HIS PLANS ACCORDINGLY AND WENT OFF TO THE HOUSE OF KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND TOLD HIM THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED KIHACHI WAS OF COURSE GREATLY ASTONISHED AND SAID SOME TIME AGO SIR CHOKICHI CAME HERE
6476-57446-0015 AND SAID THAT MY LORD GENZABURO HAVING BEEN REBUKED BY HIS FAMILY FOR HIS PROFLIGATE BEHAVIOUR HAD DETERMINED TO BREAK OFF HIS CONNECTION WITH MY DAUGHTER OF COURSE I KNEW THAT THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA WAS NO FITTING MATCH FOR A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0017 BUT WHEN I TELL HER WHAT YOU HAVE JUST SAID HOW GLAD AND HAPPY SHE WILL BE LET ME GO AND TALK TO HER AT ONCE
6476-57446-0018 WELL AT ANY RATE I HAVE SOME NEWS FOR YOU THAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY A MESSENGER HAS COME FROM MY LORD GENZABURO FOR WHOM YOUR HEART YEARNS AT THIS O KOYO WHO HAD BEEN CROUCHING DOWN LIKE A DROOPING FLOWER GAVE A GREAT START AND CRIED OUT IS THAT REALLY TRUE
6476-57446-0020 AND GO TO MEET YOUR LOVER AS SOON AS YOU PLEASE WHEN O KOYO HEARD THIS SHE WAS SO HAPPY THAT SHE THOUGHT IT MUST ALL BE A DREAM AND DOUBTED HER OWN SENSES KIHACHI IN THE MEANWHILE REJOINED SAZEN IN THE OTHER ROOM AND
6476-57446-0021 AFTER TELLING HIM OF THE JOY WITH WHICH HIS DAUGHTER HAD HEARD THE NEWS PUT BEFORE HIM WINE AND OTHER DELICACIES I THINK SAID SAZEN THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE FOR O KOYO TO LIVE SECRETLY IN MY LORD GENZABURO'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0023 MEANWHILE O KOYO HAD BETTER COME HOME WITH ME TO NIGHT ALTHOUGH SHE IS SO TERRIBLY OUT OF SPIRITS NOW SHE SHALL MEET GENZABURO THE DAY AFTER TO MORROW KIHACHI REPORTED THIS TO O KOYO AND AS HER PINING FOR GENZABURO WAS THE ONLY CAUSE OF HER SICKNESS
6476-57446-0024 SHE RECOVERED HER SPIRITS AT ONCE AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD GO WITH SAZEN IMMEDIATELY JOYFULLY MADE HER PREPARATIONS THEN SAZEN HAVING ONCE MORE WARNED KIHACHI TO KEEP THE MATTER SECRET FROM CHOKICHI AND TO ACT UPON THE LETTER WHICH HE SHOULD SEND HIM
6476-57446-0026 SAID TO HIMSELF THAT IT WAS NO WONDER THAT GENZABURO HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER THEN AS IT WAS GETTING LATE HE ADVISED HER TO GO TO REST AND AFTER SHOWING HER TO HER APARTMENTS WENT TO HIS OWN ROOM AND WROTE HIS LETTER TO KIHACHI
6476-57446-0027 CONTAINING THE SCHEME WHICH HE HAD DEVISED WHEN KIHACHI RECEIVED HIS INSTRUCTIONS HE WAS FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT SAZEN'S INGENUITY AND PUTTING ON AN APPEARANCE OF GREAT ALARM AND AGITATION
6476-57446-0029 PRETENDING TO WIPE AWAY HIS TEARS MY DAUGHTER O KOYO MOURNING OVER HER SEPARATION FROM MY LORD GENZABURO AT FIRST REFUSED ALL SUSTENANCE AND REMAINED NURSING HER SORROWS UNTIL LAST NIGHT HER WOMAN'S HEART FAILING TO BEAR UP AGAINST HER GREAT GRIEF
6476-57446-0030 SHE DROWNED HERSELF IN THE RIVER LEAVING BEHIND HER A PAPER ON WHICH SHE HAD WRITTEN HER INTENTION WHEN CHOKICHI HEARD THIS HE WAS THUNDERSTRUCK AND EXCLAIMED CAN THIS REALLY BE TRUE AND WHEN I THINK THAT IT WAS I WHO FIRST INTRODUCED HER TO MY LORD
6476-57446-0032 TO YOU THROUGH WHOSE INTERVENTION SHE BECAME ALLIED WITH A NOBLEMAN
6476-57446-0033 YOU AMAZE ME REPLIED THE OTHER HOW COULD I ABOVE ALL MEN
6476-57446-0035 AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT IT WAS THE VERY LETTER WHICH CONTAINED SAZEN'S INSTRUCTIONS TO KIHACHI AND IN WHICH THE WHOLE STORY WHICH HAD JUST AFFECTED HIM SO MUCH WAS MADE UP WHEN HE PERCEIVED THE TRICK THAT HAD BEEN PLAYED UPON HIM HE WAS VERY ANGRY AND EXCLAIMED
6476-57446-0036 AND ALL IN VAIN WELL THEY'VE GULLED ME ONCE BUT I'LL BE EVEN WITH THEM YET AND HINDER THEIR GAME BEFORE IT IS PLAYED OUT
6476-57446-0038 WHEN THE DAY WHICH HAD BEEN FIXED UPON BY HIM AND GENZABURO ARRIVED MADE O KOYO PUT ON HER BEST CLOTHES SMARTENED UP HIS HOUSE AND GOT READY A FEAST AGAINST GENZABURO'S ARRIVAL THE LATTER CAME PUNCTUALLY TO HIS TIME
6476-57446-0039 AND GOING IN AT ONCE SAID TO THE FORTUNE TELLER
6476-57446-0041 PRAY DON'T MENTION IT SIR BUT AS IT IS A LONG TIME SINCE YOU HAVE MET THE YOUNG LADY YOU MUST HAVE A GREAT DEAL TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER SO I WILL GO DOWNSTAIRS AND IF YOU WANT ANYTHING PRAY CALL ME AND SO HE WENT DOWNSTAIRS AND LEFT THEM
6476-57446-0042 THEN GENZABURO ADDRESSING O KOYO SAID AH IT IS INDEED A LONG TIME SINCE WE MET HOW HAPPY IT MAKES ME TO SEE YOU AGAIN WHY YOUR FACE HAS GROWN QUITE THIN POOR THING HAVE YOU BEEN UNHAPPY
6476-57446-0044 COME SWEETHEART THERE IS NO NEED TO SOB SO TALK TO ME A LITTLE AND LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE AT LAST O KOYO RAISED HER HEAD AND SAID AH
6476-57446-0045 AND THOUGHT THAT I SHOULD NEVER MEET YOU AGAIN HOW TENDERLY I THOUGHT OF YOU
6476-57446-0047 WITH HER PALE DELICATE FACE AND HE LOVED HER BETTER THAN BEFORE THEN SHE SAID
6476-57446-0048 I SHOULD NEVER STOP YES REPLIED GENZABURO I TOO HAVE SUFFERED MUCH AND SO THEY TOLD ONE ANOTHER THEIR MUTUAL GRIEFS AND FROM THAT DAY FORTH THEY CONSTANTLY MET AT SAZEN'S HOUSE
6476-57446-0050 AND MY NAME IS CHOKICHI I BEG TO BESPEAK YOUR GOODWILL FOR MYSELF I HOPE WE MAY BE FRIENDS SAZEN WAS NOT A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK AT THIS HOWEVER HE PUT ON AN INNOCENT FACE AS THOUGH HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF CHOKICHI BEFORE AND SAID
6476-57446-0051 I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING WHY I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOME RESPECTABLE PERSON AND YOU HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO TELL ME THAT YOUR NAME IS CHOKICHI
6476-57446-0053 WHY I THOUGHT YOU MUST BE ONE OF US INSOLENT KNAVE BEGONE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
6476-57446-0054 YOU HAD BETTER GET RID OF O KOYO AS WELL I SUPPOSE SHE MUST EQUALLY BE A POLLUTION TO IT THIS PUT SAZEN RATHER IN A DILEMMA HOWEVER HE MADE UP HIS MIND NOT TO SHOW ANY HESITATION AND SAID WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
6476-57446-0056 AND AS HE PRETENDED TO LEAVE THE HOUSE SAZEN AT HIS WITS END CRIED OUT STOP STOP
6476-57446-0057 PRAY STOP AND LISTEN QUIETLY IT IS QUITE TRUE AS YOU SAID THAT O KOYO IS IN MY HOUSE AND REALLY YOUR INDIGNATION IS PERFECTLY JUST COME LET US TALK OVER MATTERS A LITTLE
6476-57446-0059 SAZEN AFTER A MOMENT'S CONSIDERATION HIT UPON A SCHEME AND ANSWERED SMILING
6476-57446-0060 YOU SHALL HAVE THE HUNDRED RIYOS YOU ASK FOR BUT AS I HAVE NOT SO MUCH MONEY BY ME AT PRESENT I WILL GO TO GENZABURO'S HOUSE AND FETCH IT IT'S GETTING DARK NOW BUT IT'S NOT VERY LATE
6476-57446-0062 KEPT LOOKING OUT FOR A MOMENT WHEN CHOKICHI SHOULD BE OFF HIS GUARD IN ORDER TO KILL HIM BUT CHOKICHI KEPT HIS EYES OPEN AND DID NOT GIVE SAZEN A CHANCE AT LAST CHOKICHI AS ILL LUCK WOULD HAVE IT STUMBLED AGAINST A STONE AND FELL
6476-57446-0063 AND SAZEN PROFITING BY THE CHANCE DREW HIS DIRK AND STABBED HIM IN THE SIDE AND AS CHOKICHI TAKEN BY SURPRISE TRIED TO GET UP HE CUT HIM SEVERELY OVER THE HEAD UNTIL AT LAST HE FELL DEAD
6476-57446-0065 AND WHICH PROVED TO BE THE VERY LETTER WHICH SAZEN HAD SENT TO KIHACHI AND WHICH CHOKICHI HAD PICKED UP THE MATTER WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE GOVERNOR AND SAZEN HAVING BEEN SUMMONED AN INVESTIGATION WAS HELD
6476-57446-0066 SAZEN CUNNING AND BOLD MURDERER AS HE WAS LOST HIS SELF POSSESSION WHEN HE SAW WHAT A FOOL HE HAD BEEN NOT TO GET BACK FROM CHOKICHI THE LETTER WHICH HE HAD WRITTEN AND WHEN HE WAS PUT TO A RIGID EXAMINATION UNDER TORTURE
6476-57446-0068 AS HE HAD DISGRACED HIS POSITION AS A HATAMOTO BY CONTRACTING AN ALLIANCE WITH THE DAUGHTER OF AN ETA HIS PROPERTY SHOULD BE CONFISCATED HIS FAMILY BLOTTED OUT AND HIMSELF BANISHED AS FOR KIHACHI THE ETA CHIEF AND HIS DAUGHTER O KOYO
6476-57446-0069 AND BY HIM THEY TOO WERE BANISHED WHILE SAZEN AGAINST WHOM THE MURDER OF CHOKICHI HAD BEEN FULLY PROVED WAS EXECUTED ACCORDING TO LAW NOTE AT ASAKUSA IN YEDO THERE LIVES A MAN CALLED DANZAYEMON
6476-57446-0071 THE THIRTY SIXTH LAW PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS ALL WANDERING MENDICANTS SUCH AS MALE SORCERERS FEMALE DIVINERS HERMITS BLIND PEOPLE BEGGARS AND TANNERS ETAS HAVE HAD FROM OF OLD THEIR RESPECTIVE RULERS
6476-57446-0072 BE NOT DISINCLINED HOWEVER TO PUNISH ANY SUCH WHO GIVE RISE TO DISPUTES OR WHO OVERSTEP THE BOUNDARIES OF THEIR OWN CLASSES AND ARE DISOBEDIENT TO EXISTING LAWS
6476-57446-0074 PLAYING ON THE SHAMISEN A SORT OF BANJO AND SINGING BALLADS THEY NEVER MARRY OUT OF THEIR OWN FRATERNITY BUT REMAIN APART A DESPISED AND SHUNNED RACE AT EXECUTIONS BY CRUCIFIXION
6476-57446-0075 AND BESIDES THIS THEY HAVE TO PERFORM ALL SORTS OF DEGRADING OFFICES ABOUT CRIMINALS SUCH AS CARRYING SICK PRISONERS FROM THEIR CELLS TO THE HALL OF JUSTICE AND BURYING THE BODIES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED
6476-57446-0077 BUT KIYOMORI DESIRING TO DESTROY THE FAMILY OF YOSHITOMO ROOT AND BRANCH ORDERED HIS RETAINERS TO DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO BANDS AND SEEK OUT THE CHILDREN AT LAST THEY WERE FOUND BUT TOKIWA WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY BEAUTIFUL
6476-57446-0078 THAT KIYOMORI WAS INFLAMED WITH LOVE FOR HER AND DESIRED HER TO BECOME HIS OWN CONCUBINE THEN TOKIWA TOLD KIYOMORI THAT IF HE WOULD SPARE HER LITTLE ONES SHE WOULD SHARE HIS COUCH
6476-57446-0080 AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD
6476-57446-0081 TO THE DELIGHT OF HER PARENTS WHO REJOICED THAT THEIR DAUGHTER SHOULD BEAR SEED TO A NOBLEMAN BUT SHE SOON FELL SICK AND DIED AND THE OLD PEOPLE TOOK CHARGE OF THE BABE AND WHEN THEY ALSO DIED THE CARE OF THE CHILD FELL TO HIS MOTHER'S KINSMEN
6476-57446-0083 AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
6476-57446-0084 AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS
6476-57446-0086 IF I BECOME A SAMURAI AND THE RETAINER OF SOME NOBLE I SHALL NOT BE SO HAPPY AS WHEN I WAS MY OWN MASTER IF I MAY NOT REMAIN A HUSBANDMAN LET ME BE A CHIEF OVER MEN HOWEVER HUMBLE THEY MAY BE
6476-57446-0087 AND THINKING TO PUNISH THE PEASANT FOR HIS INSOLENCE SAID
6476-96661-0001 IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE AND THEN THERE CAME ONE WHO HAD BOTH WELCOME AND REVERENCE FROM JASON THIS ONE CAME WITHOUT SPEAR OR BOW BEARING IN HIS HANDS A LYRE ONLY HE WAS ORPHEUS
6476-96661-0002 AND HE KNEW ALL THE WAYS OF THE GODS AND ALL THE STORIES OF THE GODS WHEN HE SANG TO HIS LYRE THE TREES WOULD LISTEN AND THE BEASTS WOULD FOLLOW HIM
6476-96661-0004 TIPHYS KNEW ALL ABOUT THE SUN AND WINDS AND STARS AND ALL ABOUT THE SIGNS BY WHICH A SHIP MIGHT BE STEERED AND NAUPLIUS HAD THE LOVE OF POSEIDON THE GOD OF THE SEA AFTERWARD THERE CAME ONE AFTER THE OTHER
6476-96661-0005 TWO WHO WERE FAMOUS FOR THEIR HUNTING NO TWO COULD BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN THESE TWO WERE THE FIRST WAS ARCAS HE WAS DRESSED IN THE SKIN OF A BEAR HE HAD RED HAIR AND SAVAGE LOOKING EYES
6476-96661-0007 AND THEN HE WAS THE OLDEST OF THE HEROES IN THE CAMP OF AGAMEMNON TWO BROTHERS CAME WHO WERE TO BE SPECIAL FRIENDS OF JASON'S PELEUS AND TELAMON BOTH WERE STILL YOUTHFUL AND NEITHER HAD YET ACHIEVED ANY NOTABLE DEED
6476-96661-0008 ANOTHER WHO CAME WAS ADMETUS AFTERWARD HE BECAME A FAMOUS KING THE GOD APOLLO ONCE MADE HIMSELF A SHEPHERD AND HE KEPT THE FLOCKS OF KING ADMETUS AND THERE CAME TWO BROTHERS TWINS WHO WERE A WONDER TO ALL WHO BEHELD THEM
6476-96661-0010 WHOSE NAME WAS THESEUS THESEUS'S FATHER WAS AN UNKNOWN KING HE HAD BIDDEN THE MOTHER SHOW THEIR SON WHERE HIS SWORD WAS HIDDEN UNDER A GREAT STONE THE KING HAD HIDDEN IT BEFORE THESEUS WAS BORN
6476-96661-0011 ON THE DAY THAT THE MESSENGERS HAD SET OUT TO BRING THROUGH GREECE THE WORD OF JASON'S GOING FORTH IN QUEST OF THE GOLDEN FLEECE
6476-96661-0013 THE HARBOR OF IOLCUS ON THE NIGHT OF THE DAY HE HAD HELPED TO BRING THEM DOWN JASON HAD A DREAM HE DREAMT THAT SHE WHOM HE HAD SEEN IN THE FOREST WAYS AND AFTERWARD BY THE RIVER ANAURUS APPEARED TO HIM
6476-96661-0014 HE WENT TO THE CITY'S GATE AND HE MET SUCH A MAN ARGUS WAS HIS NAME HE TOLD JASON THAT A DREAM HAD SENT HIM TO THE CITY OF IOLCUS JASON WELCOMED HIM AND LODGED HIM IN THE KING'S PALACE
6476-96661-0016 AND THAT DAY THE BUILDING OF THE GREAT SHIP WAS BEGUN
6476-96661-0017 CAME THE NOISE OF HAMMERING IN THE STREET WHERE THE METALWORKERS WERE CAME THE NOISE OF BEATING UPON METALS AS THE SMITHS FASHIONED OUT OF BRONZE ARMOR FOR THE HEROES AND SWORDS AND SPEARS EVERY DAY
6476-96661-0019 WHEN THE SHIP WAS BUILT AND MADE READY FOR THE VOYAGE A NAME WAS GIVEN TO IT THE ARGO IT WAS CALLED
6476-96661-0020 ALL WAS READY FOR THE VOYAGE AND NOW JASON WENT WITH HIS FRIENDS TO VIEW THE SHIP BEFORE SHE WAS BROUGHT INTO THE WATER ARGUS THE MASTER WAS ON THE SHIP SEEING TO IT THAT THE LAST THINGS WERE BEING DONE BEFORE ARGO WAS LAUNCHED
6476-96661-0022 WONDERFUL TO THE HEROES ARGO LOOKED WITH HER LONG OARS AND HER HIGH SAILS WITH HER TIMBERS PAINTED RED AND GOLD AND BLUE AND WITH A MARVELOUS FIGURE CARVED UPON HER PROW ALL OVER THE SHIP JASON'S EYES WENT
6476-96661-0023 HE SAW A FIGURE STANDING BY THE MAST FOR A MOMENT HE LOOKED ON IT AND THEN THE FIGURE BECAME SHADOWY
6476-96661-0025 SETTING OUT ON THE VOYAGE TO FAR COLCHIS WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE PALACE THEY SAW THAT ANOTHER HERO HAD ARRIVED HIS SHIELD WAS HUNG IN THE HALL THE HEROES ALL GATHERED AROUND AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE BEAUTY OF IT
6476-96661-0026 STRIFE AND PURSUIT AND FLIGHT TUMULT AND PANIC AND SLAUGHTER THE FIGURE OF FATE WAS THERE DRAGGING A DEAD MAN BY THE FEET
6476-96661-0028 THERE WERE MEN FIGHTING AND WOMEN WATCHING FROM HIGH TOWERS THE AWFUL FIGURE OF THE DARKNESS OF DEATH WAS SHOWN THERE TOO WITH MOURNFUL EYES AND THE DUST OF BATTLES UPON HER SHOULDERS THE OUTER RIM OF THE SHIELD
6476-96661-0029 SHOWED THE STREAM OF OCEAN THE STREAM THAT ENCIRCLES THE WORLD SWANS WERE SOARING ABOVE AND SWIMMING ON ITS SURFACE ALL IN WONDER THE HEROES GAZED ON THE GREAT SHIELD TELLING EACH OTHER THAT ONLY ONE MAN IN ALL THE WORLD COULD CARRY IT
6529-62554-0001 OR SOME OTHER MATERIAL OF THE SAME NATURE THAT THE WATER OF THE CHANNEL HAD BEEN RAISED LIKE A DOME THE BOTTOM OF THE BRIG CRUSHED IN AND SHE HAD SUNK INSTANTLY THE DAMAGE DONE TO HER HULL
6529-62554-0002 THE SPEEDY HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WITHSTAND A TORPEDO THAT WOULD HAVE DESTROYED AN IRONCLAD AS EASILY AS A FISHING BOAT YES ALL WAS EXPLAINED EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE PRESENCE OF THE TORPEDO IN THE WATERS OF THE CHANNEL
6529-62554-0004 WHAT HIS OBJECT CAN BE IN ACTING THUS IN CONCEALING HIMSELF AFTER RENDERING US SO MANY SERVICES I CANNOT UNDERSTAND BUT HIS SERVICES ARE NOT THE LESS REAL
6529-62554-0005 AND ARE OF SUCH A NATURE THAT ONLY A MAN POSSESSED OF PRODIGIOUS POWER COULD RENDER THEM AYRTON IS INDEBTED TO HIM AS MUCH AS WE ARE FOR IF IT WAS THE STRANGER WHO SAVED ME FROM THE WAVES AFTER THE FALL FROM THE BALLOON
6529-62554-0007 IN A WORD THAT ALL THOSE INEXPLICABLE EVENTS FOR WHICH WE COULD NOT ASSIGN A REASON ARE DUE TO THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING THEREFORE WHOEVER HE MAY BE WHETHER SHIPWRECKED OR EXILED ON OUR ISLAND WE SHALL BE UNGRATEFUL IF WE THINK OURSELVES FREED FROM GRATITUDE TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0008 WE HAVE CONTRACTED A DEBT AND I HOPE THAT WE SHALL ONE DAY PAY IT YOU ARE RIGHT IN SPEAKING THUS MY DEAR CYRUS REPLIED GIDEON SPILETT YES THERE IS AN ALMOST ALL POWERFUL BEING HIDDEN IN SOME PART OF THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0010 IS IT HE WHO IS IN SECRET COMMUNICATION WITH US BY THE WELL IN GRANITE HOUSE AND HAS HE THUS A KNOWLEDGE OF ALL OUR PLANS WAS IT HE WHO THREW US THAT BOTTLE WHEN THE VESSEL MADE HER FIRST CRUISE
6529-62554-0011 WAS IT HE WHO THREW TOP OUT OF THE LAKE AND KILLED THE DUGONG WAS IT HE WHO AS EVERYTHING LEADS US TO BELIEVE SAVED YOU FROM THE WAVES AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ANY ONE ELSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACT IF IT WAS HE
6529-62554-0013 IF THE INTERVENTION OF A HUMAN BEING IS NOT MORE QUESTIONABLE FOR US I AGREE THAT HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL MEANS OF ACTION BEYOND THOSE POSSESSED BY HUMANITY THERE IS A MYSTERY STILL BUT IF WE DISCOVER THE MAN THE MYSTERY WILL BE DISCOVERED ALSO THE QUESTION THEN IS
6529-62554-0014 WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE MATTER MY OPINION SAID PENCROFT IS THAT WHOEVER HE MAY BE HE IS A BRAVE MAN AND HE HAS MY ESTEEM BE IT SO ANSWERED HARDING BUT THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER PENCROFT
6529-62554-0016 I AM OF NEB'S OPINION SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT THAT IS NO REASON FOR NOT ATTEMPTING THE ADVENTURE WHETHER WE FIND THIS MYSTERIOUS BEING OR NOT WE SHALL AT LEAST HAVE FULFILLED OUR DUTY TOWARDS HIM
6529-62554-0017 AND YOU MY BOY GIVE US YOUR OPINION SAID THE ENGINEER TURNING TO HERBERT OH CRIED HERBERT HIS COUNTENANCE FULL OF ANIMATION HOW I SHOULD LIKE TO THANK HIM HE WHO SAVED YOU FIRST AND WHO HAS NOW SAVED US
6529-62554-0019 BUT PENCROFT ANSWERED SPILETT YOU ARE DESCRIBING A PICTURE OF THE CREATOR POSSIBLY MISTER SPILETT REPLIED THE SAILOR BUT THAT IS HOW I IMAGINE HIM AND YOU AYRTON ASKED THE ENGINEER CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0020 YOU ARE OUR COMPANION YOU HAVE ALREADY ENDANGERED YOUR LIFE SEVERAL TIMES FOR US AND YOU AS WELL AS THE REST OUGHT TO BE CONSULTED IN THE MATTER OF ANY IMPORTANT DECISION SPEAK THEREFORE CAPTAIN HARDING REPLIED AYRTON
6529-62554-0022 THEREFORE IT IS THANKS TO HIM THAT I HAVE BECOME A MAN AGAIN NO I WILL NEVER FORGET HIM THAT IS SETTLED THEN SAID CYRUS HARDING WE WILL BEGIN OUR RESEARCHES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE WE WILL NOT LEAVE A CORNER OF THE ISLAND UNEXPLORED
6529-62554-0023 WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
6529-62554-0025 AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
6529-62554-0026 THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
6529-62554-0028 WERE HOISTED BY MEANS OF TACKLE AND PULLEYS RIGHT UP INTO GRANITE HOUSE EMBRASURES WERE MADE BETWEEN THE WINDOWS AND THE SHINING MUZZLES OF THE GUNS COULD SOON BE SEEN THROUGH THE GRANITE CLIFF FROM THIS HEIGHT THEY COMMANDED ALL UNION BAY
6529-62554-0029 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
6529-62554-0031 BUT THE PYROXYLE WHICH WILL NEVER FAIL US CAN THE CANNON SUPPORT THE SHOCK OF THE PYROXYLE ASKED THE REPORTER WHO WAS NOT LESS ANXIOUS THAN PENCROFT TO TRY THE ARTILLERY OF GRANITE HOUSE I BELIEVE SO HOWEVER ADDED THE ENGINEER WE WILL BE PRUDENT
6529-62554-0032 THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
6529-62554-0034 I HAVE THEREFORE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OUR GUNS WILL BEAR WITHOUT RISK THE EXPANSION OF THE PYROXYLE GAS AND WILL GIVE EXCELLENT RESULTS WE SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE CERTAIN OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED THEM ANSWERED PENCROFT
6529-62554-0035 IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
6529-62554-0037 THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
6529-62554-0038 SUCH A SHOT THE HONOR OF WHICH BELONGED TO HIS DEAR BOY THE THIRD SHOT AIMED THIS TIME AT THE DOWNS FORMING THE UPPER SIDE OF UNION BAY STRUCK THE SAND AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES THEN HAVING RICOCHETED WAS LOST IN THE SEA IN A CLOUD OF SPRAY
6529-62554-0040 A TREMENDOUS REPORT WAS HEARD BUT THE PIECE HAD HELD GOOD AND THE COLONISTS RUSHING TO THE WINDOWS SAW THE SHOT GRAZE THE ROCKS OF MANDIBLE CAPE NEARLY FIVE MILES FROM GRANITE HOUSE AND DISAPPEAR IN SHARK GULF
6529-62554-0041 BELIEVE ME PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER IT WOULD BE BETTER NOT TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPERIMENT WELL SAID THE SAILOR WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE WITH REGARD TO THOSE SIX VILLAINS WHO ARE ROAMING ABOUT THE ISLAND
6529-62554-0043 TURNING TO HIS COMPANION AYRTON HESITATED AT FIRST TO REPLY AND CYRUS HARDING REGRETTED THAT PENCROFT HAD SO THOUGHTLESSLY PUT THIS QUESTION AND HE WAS MUCH MOVED WHEN AYRTON REPLIED IN A HUMBLE TONE
6529-62554-0044 HE HAS AS MUCH RIGHT TO SPEAK HERE AS ANY ONE YES SAID GIDEON SPILETT BUT HIS RESERVE DOES HIM HONOR AND IT IS RIGHT TO RESPECT THE FEELING WHICH HE HAS ABOUT HIS SAD PAST CERTAINLY MISTER SPILETT ANSWERED THE SAILOR
6529-62554-0046 PENCROFT THINK OF AYRTON SAID HERBERT TAKING THE SAILOR'S HAND HE BECAME AN HONEST MAN AGAIN PENCROFT LOOKED AT HIS COMPANIONS ONE AFTER THE OTHER HE HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF HIS PROPOSAL BEING MET WITH ANY OBJECTION
6529-62554-0047 HIS ROUGH NATURE COULD NOT ALLOW THAT THEY OUGHT TO COME TO TERMS WITH THE RASCALS WHO HAD LANDED ON THE ISLAND WITH BOB HARVEY'S ACCOMPLICES THE MURDERERS OF THE CREW OF THE SPEEDY AND HE LOOKED UPON THEM AS WILD BEASTS WHICH OUGHT TO BE DESTROYED WITHOUT DELAY AND WITHOUT REMORSE
6529-62554-0049 THEY ARE SIX AND WELL ARMED IF THEY EACH LAY HID IN A CORNER AND EACH FIRED AT ONE OF US THEY WOULD SOON BE MASTERS OF THE COLONY WHY HAVE THEY NOT DONE SO SAID HERBERT NO DOUBT BECAUSE IT WAS NOT THEIR INTEREST TO DO IT BESIDES WE ARE SIX ALSO
6529-62554-0050 WELL WELL REPLIED PENCROFT WHOM NO REASONING COULD HAVE CONVINCED LET US LEAVE THESE GOOD PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY LIKE AND DON'T THINK ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM COME PENCROFT SAID NEBRASKA DON'T MAKE YOURSELF OUT SO BAD AS ALL THAT
6529-62554-0052 YOU HAVE ALWAYS SHOWN MUCH DEFERENCE TO MY ADVICE WILL YOU IN THIS MATTER YIELD TO ME I WILL DO AS YOU PLEASE CAPTAIN HARDING ANSWERED THE SAILOR WHO WAS NOT AT ALL CONVINCED VERY WELL WAIT
6529-62554-0053 AND WE WILL NOT ATTACK THEM UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED FIRST THUS THEIR BEHAVIOR TOWARDS THE PIRATES WAS AGREED UPON ALTHOUGH PENCROFT AUGURED NOTHING GOOD FROM IT THEY WERE NOT TO ATTACK THEM BUT WERE TO BE ON THEIR GUARD
6529-62554-0055 AT ANY RATE FOR HUMANITY'S SAKE ALONE IT WOULD BE RIGHT TO WAIT THE COLONISTS WOULD NO LONGER AS BEFORE BE ABLE TO GO AND COME WITHOUT FEAR HITHERTO THEY HAD ONLY WILD BEASTS TO GUARD AGAINST
6529-62554-0056 AND NOW SIX CONVICTS OF THE WORST DESCRIPTION PERHAPS WERE ROAMING OVER THEIR ISLAND IT WAS SERIOUS CERTAINLY AND TO LESS BRAVE MEN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SECURITY LOST NO MATTER
6529-62556-0001 HE LIVES SAID HE BUT HE MUST BE CARRIED TO GRANITE HOUSE THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE REPLIED THE ENGINEER INTO THE CORRAL THEN SAID PENCROFT IN A MOMENT SAID HARDING AND HE RAN ROUND THE LEFT CORNER OF THE PALISADE
6529-62556-0002 THERE HE FOUND A CONVICT WHO AIMING AT HIM SENT A BALL THROUGH HIS HAT IN A FEW SECONDS BEFORE HE HAD EVEN TIME TO FIRE HIS SECOND BARREL HE FELL STRUCK TO THE HEART BY HARDING'S DAGGER MORE SURE EVEN THAN HIS GUN DURING THIS TIME
6529-62556-0004 ON SEEING HERBERT SENSELESS THE SAILOR'S GRIEF WAS TERRIBLE HE SOBBED HE CRIED HE TRIED TO BEAT HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL NEITHER THE ENGINEER NOR THE REPORTER COULD CALM HIM
6529-62556-0005 WITHOUT ACQUIRING SOME SLIGHT KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICINE HE KNEW A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING AND SEVERAL TIMES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO ATTEND TO WOUNDS PRODUCED EITHER BY A SWORD BAYONET OR SHOT ASSISTED BY CYRUS HARDING HE PROCEEDED TO RENDER THE AID HERBERT REQUIRED
6529-62556-0007 THAT SPILETT ONLY FELT IT BEAT AT LONG INTERVALS AS IF IT WAS ON THE POINT OF STOPPING THESE SYMPTOMS WERE VERY SERIOUS HERBERT'S CHEST WAS LAID BARE AND THE BLOOD HAVING BEEN STANCHED WITH HANDKERCHIEFS IT WAS BATHED WITH COLD WATER
6529-62556-0008 HE UTTERED A MOAN SO FEEBLE THAT THEY ALMOST THOUGHT IT WAS HIS LAST SIGH HERBERTS BACK WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM ANOTHER CONTUSED WOUND BY WHICH THE BALL HAD IMMEDIATELY ESCAPED GOD BE PRAISED SAID THE REPORTER THE BALL IS NOT IN THE BODY AND WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO EXTRACT IT
6529-62556-0010 NO PENCROFT REPLIED CYRUS HARDING NO HE IS NOT DEAD HIS PULSE STILL BEATS HE HAS EVEN UTTERED A MOAN BUT FOR YOUR BOY'S SAKE CALM YOURSELF WE HAVE NEED OF ALL OUR SELF POSSESSION DO NOT MAKE US LOSE IT MY FRIEND
6529-62556-0011 PENCROFT WAS SILENT BUT A REACTION SET IN AND GREAT TEARS ROLLED DOWN HIS CHEEKS IN THE MEANWHILE GIDEON SPILETT ENDEAVORED TO COLLECT HIS IDEAS AND PROCEED METHODICALLY AFTER HIS EXAMINATION HE HAD NO DOUBT THAT THE BALL
6529-62556-0013 AND STILL MORE SO THE REPORTER HOWEVER HE KNEW ONE THING THIS WAS THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO PREVENT THE INFLAMMATORY STRANGULATION OF THE INJURED PARTS THEN TO CONTEND WITH THE LOCAL INFLAMMATION AND FEVER WHICH WOULD RESULT FROM THE WOUND PERHAPS MORTAL
6529-62556-0014 NOW WHAT STYPTICS WHAT ANTIPHLOGISTICS OUGHT TO BE EMPLOYED BY WHAT MEANS COULD INFLAMMATION BE PREVENTED AT ANY RATE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WAS THAT THE TWO WOUNDS SHOULD BE DRESSED WITHOUT DELAY
6529-62556-0016 THE REPORTER THEREFORE THOUGHT IT BEST TO SIMPLY BATHE THE TWO WOUNDS WITH COLD WATER HERBERT WAS PLACED ON HIS LEFT SIDE AND WAS MAINTAINED IN THAT POSITION HE MUST NOT BE MOVED SAID GIDEON SPILETT
6529-62556-0017 HE IS IN THE MOST FAVORABLE POSITION FOR THE WOUNDS IN HIS BACK AND CHEST TO SUPPURATE EASILY AND ABSOLUTE REST IS NECESSARY WHAT CAN'T WE CARRY HIM TO GRANITE HOUSE ASKED PENCROFT NO PENCROFT REPLIED THE REPORTER
6529-62556-0019 THINK ONLY OF THIS HERBERT MUST BE SAVED THESE WORDS RESTORED TO GIDEON SPILETT THAT SELF POSSESSION WHICH HE HAD LOST IN A MOMENT OF DISCOURAGEMENT ON FEELING HIS GREAT RESPONSIBILITY HE SEATED HIMSELF CLOSE TO THE BED CYRUS HARDING STOOD NEAR
6529-62556-0020 PENCROFT HAD TORN UP HIS SHIRT AND WAS MECHANICALLY MAKING LINT SPILETT THEN EXPLAINED TO CYRUS HARDING THAT HE THOUGHT HE OUGHT FIRST OF ALL TO STOP THE HEMORRHAGE BUT NOT CLOSE THE TWO WOUNDS OR CAUSE THEIR IMMEDIATE CICATRIZATION FOR THERE HAD BEEN INTERNAL PERFORATION
6529-62556-0022 DID THE COLONISTS POSSESS AN EFFICACIOUS AGENT TO ACT AGAINST THE INFLAMMATION WHICH MIGHT OCCUR YES THEY HAD ONE FOR NATURE HAD GENEROUSLY LAVISHED IT THEY HAD COLD WATER THAT IS TO SAY THE MOST POWERFUL SEDATIVE THAT CAN BE EMPLOYED AGAINST INFLAMMATION OF WOUNDS
6529-62556-0023 THE MOST EFFICACIOUS THERAPEUTIC AGENT IN GRAVE CASES AND THE ONE WHICH IS NOW ADOPTED BY ALL PHYSICIANS COLD WATER HAS MOREOVER THE ADVANTAGE OF LEAVING THE WOUND IN ABSOLUTE REST AND PRESERVING IT FROM ALL PREMATURE DRESSING A CONSIDERABLE ADVANTAGE
6529-62556-0025 COMPRESSES OF LINEN WERE APPLIED TO POOR HERBERT'S TWO WOUNDS AND WERE KEPT CONSTANTLY WET WITH COLD WATER THE SAILOR HAD AT FIRST LIGHTED A FIRE IN THE HUT WHICH WAS NOT WANTING IN THINGS NECESSARY FOR LIFE MAPLE SUGAR MEDICINAL PLANTS
6529-62556-0026 THE SAME WHICH THE LAD HAD GATHERED ON THE BANKS OF LAKE GRANT ENABLED THEM TO MAKE SOME REFRESHING DRINKS WHICH THEY GAVE HIM WITHOUT HIS TAKING ANY NOTICE OF IT HIS FEVER WAS EXTREMELY HIGH AND ALL THAT DAY AND NIGHT PASSED WITHOUT HIS BECOMING CONSCIOUS
6529-62556-0028 THE REPORTER AND PENCROFT HE UTTERED TWO OR THREE WORDS HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEY TOLD HIM AND SPILETT BEGGED HIM TO REMAIN PERFECTLY STILL TELLING HIM THAT HIS LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER AND THAT HIS WOUNDS WOULD HEAL IN A FEW DAYS
6529-62556-0029 HOWEVER HERBERT SCARCELY SUFFERED AT ALL AND THE COLD WATER WITH WHICH THEY WERE CONSTANTLY BATHED PREVENTED ANY INFLAMMATION OF THE WOUNDS THE SUPPURATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN A REGULAR WAY THE FEVER DID NOT INCREASE
6529-62556-0031 HERBERT DOZED AGAIN BUT HIS SLEEP APPEARED MORE NATURAL TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU HOPE MISTER SPILETT SAID PENCROFT TELL ME AGAIN THAT YOU WILL SAVE HERBERT YES WE WILL SAVE HIM REPLIED THE REPORTER THE WOUND IS SERIOUS AND PERHAPS
6529-62556-0032 EVEN THE BALL HAS TRAVERSED THE LUNGS BUT THE PERFORATION OF THIS ORGAN IS NOT FATAL GOD BLESS YOU ANSWERED PENCROFT AS MAY BE BELIEVED DURING THE FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS THEY HAD BEEN IN THE CORRAL THE COLONISTS HAD NO OTHER THOUGHT THAN THAT OF NURSING HERBERT
6529-62556-0034 AT THE MOMENT HE SCALED THE PALISADE HAD CLEARLY SEEN SOME ONE OF THE CONVICTS RUNNING ALONG THE SOUTHERN SPUR OF MOUNT FRANKLIN TOWARDS WHOM TOP HAD SPRUNG IT WAS ONE OF THOSE WHOSE OBJECT HAD BEEN SO COMPLETELY DEFEATED BY THE ROCKS AT THE MOUTH OF THE MERCY
6529-62556-0035 AND AS HE WAS A MAN TO DEFEND HIMSELF HE MUST HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED YES THAT IS TO BE FEARED SAID THE REPORTER THEN DOUBTLESS THE CONVICTS INSTALLED THEMSELVES IN THE CORRAL WHERE THEY FOUND PLENTY OF EVERYTHING AND ONLY FLED WHEN THEY SAW US COMING
6529-62556-0037 THAT WOULD HAVE SPARED US ALL THESE MISFORTUNES YES ANSWERED THE REPORTER BUT NOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE MERCILESS AT ANY RATE SAID THE ENGINEER WE ARE OBLIGED TO WAIT SOME TIME AND TO REMAIN AT THE CORRAL UNTIL WE CAN CARRY HERBERT WITHOUT DANGER TO GRANITE HOUSE

6529-62556-0040 THEY ARE HIDDEN IN THE THICK WOODS WHICH SURROUND IT AND IF YOU GO WE SHALL SOON HAVE TO REGRET TWO MISFORTUNES INSTEAD OF ONE
6529-62556-0041 IT IS NOW FOUR AND TWENTY HOURS SINCE HE HAS HAD ANY NEWS OF US HE WILL BE SURE TO COME AND AS HE WILL BE LESS ON HIS GUARD THAN WE SHOULD BE OURSELVES ADDED SPILETT HE WILL BE KILLED IS THERE REALLY NO WAY OF WARNING HIM

6531-61334-0000 THE SLEEPERS OPEN THEIR EYES AND RAISE THEMSELVES ON THEIR ELBOWS THEN THE SHEPHERD HEARS A WARNING VOICE WHICH COMES AND GOES LIKE THE WIND SAYING IF THE HORN IS BLOWN ONCE AGAIN THE WORLD WILL BE UPSET ALTOGETHER
6531-61334-0002 SHALMANESER SHAMASH ADAD ASHUR DAN
6531-61334-0003 THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES HAD GROWN ONCE AGAIN POWERFUL AND PROSPEROUS BUT NO GREAT LEADER LIKE SUBBILULIUMA AROSE TO WELD THE VARIOUS STATES INTO AN EMPIRE

6531-61334-0011 ACCUSTOMED FOR GENERATIONS TO DESERT WARFARE THEY WERE FEARLESS WARRIORS THEIR ARMIES HAD GREAT MOBILITY BEING COMPOSED MOSTLY OF MOUNTED INFANTRY AND WERE NOT EASILY OVERPOWERED BY THE ASSYRIAN FORCES OF FOOTMEN
6531-61334-0012 THE FORMER HAD RAIDED NORTH SYRIA AND APPARENTLY PENETRATED AS FAR AS THE MEDITERRANEAN COAST IN CONSEQUENCE HE CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH BABYLONIA BUT HE ULTIMATELY FORMED AN ALLIANCE WITH THAT KINGDOM HIS SON TUKULTI NINIP
6531-61334-0014 IN THE NORTH HE HAD TO DRIVE BACK INVADING BANDS OF THE MUSKI
6531-61334-0015 A SURE INDICATION THAT ASSYRIA WAS ONCE AGAIN BECOMING POWERFUL IN NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND THE REGIONS TOWARDS ARMENIA ASHUR NATSIR PAL THE THIRD
6531-61334-0017 NOT ONLY FIGHTING MEN BUT WOMEN AND CHILDREN WERE EITHER SLAUGHTERED OR BURNED AT THE STAKE IT IS NOT SURPRISING TO FIND THEREFORE THAT ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE KINGS OF PETTY STATES MADE SUBMISSION TO HIM WITHOUT RESISTANCE AS SOON AS HE INVADED THEIR DOMAINS
6531-61334-0018 IN HIS FIRST YEAR HE OVERRAN THE MOUNTAINOUS DISTRICT BETWEEN LAKE VAN AND THE UPPER SOURCES OF THE TIGRIS BUBU THE REBEL SON OF THE GOVERNOR OF NISHTUN WHO HAD BEEN TAKEN PRISONER WAS TRANSPORTED TO ARBELA WHERE HE WAS SKINNED ALIVE

6531-61334-0023 AND WHEN THEY HAD BEEN FLAYED THEIR SKINS WERE NAILED UPON THE CITY WALLS ANOTHER REVOLT BROKE OUT IN THE KIRKHI DISTRICT BETWEEN THE UPPER REACHES OF THE TIGRIS AND THE SOUTHWESTERN SHORES OF LAKE VAN
6531-61334-0024 IT WAS PROMOTED BY THE NAIRI TRIBES AND EVEN SUPPORTED BY SOME ASSYRIAN OFFICIALS TERRIBLE REPRISALS WERE METED OUT TO THE REBELS WHEN THE CITY OF KINABU WAS CAPTURED NO FEWER THAN THREE THOUSAND PRISONERS WERE BURNED ALIVE
6531-61334-0026 THE CITY OF TELLO WAS VERY STRONG

6531-61334-0030 HE WAS SO GREATLY FEARED BY THE SYRO CAPPADOCIAN HITTITES THAT WHEN HE APPROACHED THEIR TERRITORY THEY SENT HIM TRIBUTE YIELDING WITHOUT A STRUGGLE
6531-61334-0032 THITHER HE DRAFTED THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS THE GREAT MAJORITY OF WHOM HE INCORPORATED IN THE ASSYRIAN ARMY ASSYRIAN COLONIES WERE ESTABLISHED IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS FOR STRATEGICAL PURPOSES AND OFFICIALS SUPPLANTED THE PETTY KINGS IN CERTAIN OF THE NORTHERN CITY STATES
6531-61334-0033 THE ARAMAEANS OF MESOPOTAMIA GAVE MUCH TROUBLE TO ASHUR NATSIR PAL ALTHOUGH HE HAD LAID A HEAVY HAND ON SURU THE SOUTHERN TRIBES THE SUKHI STIRRED UP REVOLTS IN MESOPOTAMIA AS THE ALLIES OF THE BABYLONIANS
6531-61334-0035 WHO WAS EVIDENTLY ANXIOUS TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE WESTERN TRADE ROUTE THE ASSYRIAN WAR LORD HOWEVER PROVED TO BE TOO POWERFUL A RIVAL HE ACHIEVED SO COMPLETE A VICTORY
6531-61334-0036 THE PEOPLE OF KASHSHI BABYLONIA AND KALDU CHALDAEA WERE STRICKEN WITH TERROR AND HAD TO AGREE TO PAY INCREASED TRIBUTE
6531-61334-0038 HAVING ACCUMULATED GREAT BOOTY HE ENGAGED HIMSELF AS SOON AS PEACE WAS SECURED THROUGHOUT HIS EMPIRE IN REBUILDING THE CITY OF KALKHI WHERE HE ERECTED A GREAT PALACE AND MADE RECORDS OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
6531-61334-0039 HE ALSO EXTENDED AND REDECORATED THE ROYAL PALACE AT NINEVEH AND DEVOTED MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TEMPLES TRIBUTE POURED IN FROM THE SUBJECT STATES THE MOUNTAIN AND VALLEY TRIBES IN THE NORTH FURNISHED IN ABUNDANCE WINE AND CORN
6531-61334-0041 ARTISTS AND ARTISANS WERE ALSO PROVIDED BY THE VASSALS OF ASSYRIA THERE ARE TRACES OF PHOENICIAN INFLUENCE IN THE ART OF THIS PERIOD ASHUR NATSIR PAL'S GREAT PALACE AT KALKHI WAS EXCAVATED BY LAYARD
6531-61334-0042 WHO HAS GIVEN A VIVID DESCRIPTION OF THE VERDANT PLAIN ON WHICH THE ANCIENT CITY WAS SITUATED AS IT APPEARED IN SPRING ITS PASTURE LANDS KNOWN AS THE JAIF ARE RENOWNED HE WROTE
6531-61334-0044 AS THE SUN WENT DOWN BEHIND THE LOW HILLS WHICH SEPARATE THE RIVER FROM THE DESERT EVEN THEIR ROCKY SIDES HAD STRUGGLED TO EMULATE THE VERDANT CLOTHING OF THE PLAIN ITS RECEDING RAYS WERE GRADUALLY WITHDRAWN
6531-61334-0045 LIKE A TRANSPARENT VEIL OF LIGHT FROM THE LANDSCAPE OVER THE PURE CLOUDLESS SKY WAS THE GLOW OF THE LAST LIGHT
6531-61334-0047 THE KURDISH MOUNTAINS WHOSE SNOWY SUMMITS CHERISHED THE DYING SUNBEAMS YET STRUGGLED WITH THE TWILIGHT THE BLEATING OF SHEEP AND LOWING OF CATTLE
6531-61334-0048 AT FIRST FAINT BECAME LOUDER AS THE FLOCKS RETURNED FROM THEIR PASTURES AND WANDERED AMONGST THE TENTS GIRLS HURRIED OVER THE GREENSWARD TO SEEK THEIR FATHERS CATTLE OR CROUCHED DOWN TO MILK THOSE WHICH HAD RETURNED ALONE TO THEIR WELL REMEMBERED FOLDS
6531-61334-0050 LAYARD EXCAVATED THE EMPEROR'S PALACE AND DISPATCHED TO LONDON AMONG OTHER TREASURES OF ANTIQUITY
6531-61334-0051 THE ASSYRIAN SCULPTURES OF THIS PERIOD LACK THE TECHNICAL SKILL THE DELICACY AND IMAGINATION OF SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN ART BUT THEY ARE FULL OF ENERGY DIGNIFIED AND MASSIVE AND STRONG AND LIFELIKE
6531-61334-0053 WHEN ASHUR NATSIR PAL DIED
6531-61334-0054 WHOSE MILITARY ACTIVITIES EXTENDED OVER HIS WHOLE REIGN
6531-61334-0056 ESTABLISHED THE RELIGION OF THE CANAANITES AND MADE GODS AND MOLTEN IMAGES HE WAS CONDEMNED FOR HIS IDOLATRY BY THE PROPHET AHIJAH WHO DECLARED THE LORD SHALL SMITE ISRAEL AS A REED IS SHAKEN IN THE WATER

6531-61334-0059 AND ABIJAH PURSUED AFTER JEROBOAM AND TOOK CITIES FROM HIM BETHEL WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF AND JESHANAH WITH THE TOWNS THEREOF
6531-61334-0060 AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CITY OF DAVID
6531-61334-0062 FOR HE TOOK AWAY THE ALTARS OF THE STRANGE GODS AND THE HIGH PLACES AND BRAKE DOWN THE IMAGES AND CUT DOWN THE GROVES AND COMMANDED JUDAH TO SEEK THE LORD GOD OF THEIR FATHERS AND TO DO THE LAW AND THE COMMANDMENT
6531-61334-0063 ALSO HE TOOK AWAY OUT OF ALL THE CITIES OF JUDAH THE HIGH PLACES AND THE IMAGES
6531-61334-0065 AND APPARENTLY SUPPORTED THE REBELLIONS OF THE NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIAN KINGS
6531-61334-0066 AND THEREFORE UNABLE EITHER TO ASSERT ITS AUTHORITY IN JUDAH
6531-61334-0068 AND THE TREASURES OF THE KING'S HOUSE AND DELIVERED THEM INTO THE HAND OF HIS SERVANTS
6531-61334-0069 THE SON OF TABRIMON THE SON OF HEZION KING OF SYRIA THAT DWELT AT DAMASCUS SAYING THERE IS A LEAGUE BETWEEN ME AND THEE AND BETWEEN MY FATHER AND THY FATHER BEHOLD
6531-61334-0071 ZIMRI'S REVOLT WAS SHORTLIVED HE REIGNED ONLY SEVEN DAYS IN TIRZAH THE ARMY WAS ENCAMPED AGAINST GIBBETHON WHICH BELONGED TO THE PHILISTINES AND THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ENCAMPED HEARD SAY
6531-61334-0072 ZIMRI HATH CONSPIRED AND HATH ALSO SLAIN THE KING WHEREFORE ALL ISRAEL MADE OMRI THE CAPTAIN OF THE HOST KING OVER ISRAEL THAT DAY IN THE CAMP AND OMRI WENT UP FROM GIBBETHON AND ALL ISRAEL WITH HIM
6531-61334-0074 AND ALL THE WORKS OF THE HOUSE OF AHAB AND YE WALK IN THEIR COUNSEL
6531-61334-0075 BOAST HIMSELF AS HE THAT PUTTETH IT OFF
6531-61334-0077 THE LEADER OF A STRONG CONFEDERACY OF PETTY STATES THEREAFTER THE ASSYRIAN MONARCH TURNED TOWARDS THE SOUTH WEST AND ATTACKED THE HITTITE STATE OF HAMATH
6531-61334-0078 THE VARIOUS RIVAL KINGDOMS OF SYRIA UNITED AGAINST HIM AND AN ARMY OF SEVENTY THOUSAND ALLIES ATTEMPTED TO THWART HIS PROGRESS AT QARQAR ON THE ORONTES ALTHOUGH SHALMANESER CLAIMED A VICTORY ON THIS OCCASION
6531-61334-0080 OF DAMASCUS AND AHAB OF ISRAEL AKHABBU
6531-61334-0081 THE LATTER HAD A FORCE OF TEN THOUSAND MEN UNDER HIS COMMAND FOUR YEARS AFTER AHAB BEGAN TO REIGN
6531-61334-0083 DURING THIS PERIOD BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE TWO KINGDOMS HAD BEEN DRAWN TOGETHER
6531-61334-0084 AFTER REPULSING THE SYRIAN ALLIES AT QARQAR
6531-61334-0086 OF THAT KINGDOM AND WAS THUS ABLE TO OPERATE IN THE NORTH WEST WITHOUT FEAR OF COMPLICATIONS WITH THE RIVAL CLAIMANT OF MESOPOTAMIA
6531-61334-0087 WERE RIVALS FOR THE THRONE THE FORMER THE RIGHTFUL HEIR APPEALED FOR HELP TO SHALMANESER AND THAT MONARCH AT ONCE HASTENED TO ASSERT HIS AUTHORITY IN THE SOUTHERN KINGDOM
6531-61334-0089 AFTERWARDS REIGNED OVER BABYLONIA AS THE VASSAL OF ASSYRIA AND SHALMANESER HIS OVERLORD MADE OFFERINGS TO THE GODS AT BABYLON BORSIPPA AND CUTHAH
6531-61334-0090 AND COMPELLED TO PAY ANNUAL TRIBUTE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR SHALMANESER HAD TO LEAD AN EXPEDITION INTO NORTHERN MESOPOTAMIA AND SUPPRESS A FRESH REVOLT IN THAT TROUBLED REGION BUT THE WESTERN ALLIES SOON GATHERED STRENGTH AGAIN
6531-61334-0092 REMAINED UNCONQUERED AND CONTINUED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM THE RESISTING POWER OF THE SYRIAN ALLIES HOWEVER WAS BEING GREATLY WEAKENED BY INTERNAL REVOLTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN STIRRED UP BY ASSYRIAN EMISSARIES
6531-61334-0093 A ROYAL PRINCESS OF ISRAEL WAS DEAD
6531-61334-0095 JEHU CONSPIRED AGAINST JORAM AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY AN ESCORT
6531-61334-0096 SO THAT HE MIGHT BE THE FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THE REVOLT TO THE KING WHOM HE WAS TO DEPOSE THE WATCHMAN ON THE TOWER OF JEZREEL SAW JEHU AND HIS COMPANY APPROACHING
6531-61334-0098 AND THE DRIVING IS LIKE THE DRIVING OF JEHU THE SON OF NIMSHI FOR HE DRIVETH FURIOUSLY KING JORAM WENT OUT HIMSELF TO MEET THE FAMOUS CHARIOTEER
6531-61334-0099 WHERE HE WAS WELCOMED HE MADE OFFERINGS THERE TO HADAD THE LOCAL THOR AND THEN SUDDENLY MARCHED SOUTHWARD HAZAEL WENT OUT TO OPPOSE THE ADVANCING ASSYRIANS AND CAME INTO CONFLICT WITH THEM IN THE VICINITY OF MOUNT HERMON
6531-61334-0101 HE FLED TO SAVE HIS LIFE HAZAEL TOOK REFUGE WITHIN THE WALLS OF DAMASCUS WHICH THE ASSYRIANS BESIEGED BUT FAILED HOWEVER TO CAPTURE SHALMANESER'S SOLDIERS MEANWHILE WASTED AND BURNED CITIES WITHOUT NUMBER
6531-61334-0102 AND CARRIED AWAY GREAT BOOTY IN THOSE DAYS SHALMANESER RECORDED I RECEIVED TRIBUTE FROM THE TYRIANS AND SIDONIANS AND FROM YAUA JEHU
6531-61334-0104 JEHUA SHALMANESER DID NOT AGAIN ATTACK DAMASCUS HIS SPHERE OF INFLUENCE WAS THEREFORE CONFINED TO NORTH SYRIA
6531-61334-0105 HIS REVOLT RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF THE ORTHODOX HEBREWS AND HE BEGAN WELL BY INAUGURATING REFORMS IN THE NORTHERN KINGDOM WITH PURPOSE APPARENTLY TO RE ESTABLISH THE WORSHIP OF DAVID'S GOD HE PERSECUTED THE PROPHETS OF BAAL BUT SOON BECAME A BACKSLIDER
6531-61334-0107 OF THE IDOLATORS OF THE ANCIENT CULT OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN THE CROWN OF JUDAH HAD BEEN SEIZED BY THE ISRAELITISH QUEEN MOTHER
6531-61334-0108 BUT ANOTHER WOMAN THWARTED THE COMPLETION OF HER MONSTROUS DESIGN
6531-61334-0110 SHE CAME TO THE PEOPLE INTO THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AND SHE LOOKED AND BEHOLD THE KING STOOD AT HIS PILLAR AT THE ENTERING IN AND THE PRINCES AND THE TRUMPETS BY THE KING AND ALL THE PEOPLE OF THE LAND REJOICED AND SOUNDED WITH TRUMPETS
6531-61334-0111 ALSO THE SINGERS WITH INSTRUMENTS OF MUSICK AND SUCH AS TAUGHT TO SING PRAISE
6531-61334-0113 HAVE HER FORTH OF THE RANGES AND WHOSO FOLLOWETH HER LET HIM BE SLAIN BY THE SWORD FOR THE PRIEST SAID SLAY HER NOT IN THE HOUSE OF THE LORD SO THEY LAID HANDS ON HER
6531-61334-0114 AND WHEN SHE WAS COME TO THE ENTERING OF THE HORSE GATE BY THE KING'S HOUSE THEY SLEW HER THERE AND JEHOIADA MADE A COVENANT BETWEEN HIM AND BETWEEN ALL THE PEOPLE
6531-61334-0116 AND KEPT HIS GENERALS CONTINUALLY EMPLOYED SUPPRESSING REVOLTS ON HIS FRONTIERS AFTER HE SUBDUED THE HITTITES
6531-61334-0117 TRIBES OF THE MEDES CAME UNDER HIS POWER
6531-61334-0119 THE GREAT EMPIRE WAS SUDDENLY SHAKEN TO ITS FOUNDATIONS BY THE OUTBREAK OF CIVIL WAR THE PARTY OF REBELLION WAS LED BY SHALMANESER'S SON ASHUR DANIN APLI
6531-61334-0120 HE WAS A POPULAR HERO AND RECEIVED THE SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE IMPORTANT ASSYRIAN CITIES INCLUDING NINEVEH
6531-61334-0122 AFTER FOUR YEARS OF CIVIL WAR SHALMANESER DIED HIS CHOSEN HEIR
6531-61334-0123 WHEN AT LENGTH THE NEW KING HAD STAMPED OUT THE LAST EMBERS OF REVOLT WITHIN THE KINGDOM HE HAD TO UNDERTAKE THE RECONQUEST OF THOSE PROVINCES WHICH IN THE INTERVAL
6531-61334-0125 SHAMSHI ADAD HOWEVER
6531-61334-0126 BURNED MANY CITIES AND COLLECTED ENORMOUS TRIBUTE WHILE THOUSANDS OF PRISONERS WERE TAKEN AND FORCED TO SERVE THE CONQUEROR HAVING ESTABLISHED HIS POWER IN THE NORTH SHAMSHI ADAD
6531-61334-0128 AND ACHIEVED A GREAT VICTORY KILLING THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND TAKING THREE THOUSAND CAPTIVES THEN THE BABYLONIAN KING
6531-61334-0129 BUT WAS DEFEATED IN A FIERCE BATTLE ON THE BANKS OF THE DABAN CANAL
6531-61334-0131 IN THE END HE TOOK PRISONER THE NEW KING
6531-61334-0132 FOR OVER HALF A CENTURY AFTER THIS DISASTER BABYLONIA WAS A PROVINCE OF ASSYRIA
6563-63821-0001 HE WAS ONE OF THE FEW COLONELS OF THAT DAY WHO HAD ACTUALLY HELD A COLONEL'S COMMAND HAVING BEEN REGULARLY COMMISSIONED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AS A COLONEL OF ARTILLERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE MIGHT INDEED HAVE BEEN CALLED MAJOR GENERAL
6563-63821-0002 FOR IN HIS OLD AGE HE HELD THAT RANK IN THE MILITIA OF THE DISTRICT AND A VERY FINE LOOKING SOLDIER HE MUST HAVE BEEN IN HIS PRIME JUDGING FROM THE PORTRAIT WHICH USED TO HANG IN THE LIBRARY REPRESENTING A FULL FORMED MAN TALL AND ERECT
6563-63821-0004 WITH STREETS AND CROSS STREETS OF PINE BOOK SHELVES UNPAINTED ALL FILLED WITH BOOKS TO THEIR UTMOST CAPACITY A WILDERNESS OF BOOKS IN PRINT AND IN MANUSCRIPT MOSTLY OLD AND DINGY
6563-63821-0005 AND ALMOST ALL OF THEM RELATING IN SOME WAY TO AMERICAN HISTORY THE PLACE HAD A VERY MUSTY SMELL AND AS MOST OF ITS TREASURES WERE IN THE ORIGINAL BINDINGS OR WITHOUT BINDINGS FEW PERSONS WOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THE PRICELESS VALUE OF THE COLLECTION
6563-63821-0007 BUT OLD PETER FORCE COULD SHOW YOU SINGLE ALCOVES OF HIS LIBRARY WHICH AT A FAIR VALUATION WOULD BUY OUT ALL THAT MASS OF SUMPTUOSITY IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND THE OLD GENTLEMAN IN HIS DUSTY DINGY WILDERNESS
6563-63821-0008 HE WOULD TAKE PLEASURE IN EXHIBITING HIS TREASURES HE WOULD TAKE DOWN HIS EXCELLENT COPY OF ELIOT'S INDIAN BIBLE A BOOK SO FAITHFULLY MADE IN EVERY RESPECT THAT I QUESTION IF AS A MERE PIECE OF BOOK MAKING
6563-63821-0010 THE MOST RECENT OF WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE HE POSSESSED A LARGE NUMBER OF BOOKS PRINTED AND BOUND BY BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HE HAD TWO HUNDRED VOLUMES OF THE RECORDS OF COLONIAL LEGISLATURES
6563-63821-0011 HE COULD SHOW YOU A NEWSPAPER OF ALMOST EVERY MONTH NAY ALMOST EVERY WEEK SINCE NEWSPAPERS WERE FIRST PUBLISHED IN AMERICA HE HAD IN ALL NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOUND VOLUMES OF NEWSPAPERS OF WHICH TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0013 HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND DETACHED MAPS ILLUSTRATIVE BOTH OF THE GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY OF AMERICA FOR MANY OF THEM WERE MAPS AND PLANS DRAWN FOR MILITARY PURPOSES HE WOULD SHOW YOU PERHAPS
6563-63821-0014 A PEN DRAWING OF DATE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE BY A BRITISH OFFICER UPON WHICH WAS WRITTEN PLAN OF THE REBEL WORKS AT WEST POINT HE HAD ALSO SEVERAL PLANS BY BRITISH OFFICERS OF THE REBEL WORKS AROUND BOSTON DURING THE REVOLUTION
6563-63821-0016 SPECIMENS REPRESENTING EVERY YEAR FROM FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN ONWARD HE HAD MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOOKS PRINTED BEFORE THE YEAR SIXTEEN HUNDRED SO ARRANGED THAT A STUDENT COULD TRACE THE PROGRESS OF THE ART OF PRINTING FROM THE DAYS OF CAXTON
6563-63821-0017 HE HAD ALSO A VAST COLLECTION OF MANUSCRIPTS NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE VOLUMES
6563-63821-0019 AND THAT HE TRAVELED FAR AND WIDE IN SEARCH OF THESE PRECIOUS OBJECTS NOT AT ALL HE NEVER WAS A RICH MAN AND I BELIEVE HE RARELY TRAVELED BEYOND THE SIGHT OF THE DOME OF THE CAPITOL INDEED THE MOST WONDERFUL THING ABOUT HIS COLLECTION WAS THAT HE
6563-63821-0020 WHO BEGAN LIFE A JOURNEYMAN PRINTER AND WAS NEVER IN THE RECEIPT OF A LARGE INCOME SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET TOGETHER SO VAST AN AMOUNT OF VALUABLE MATERIAL PART OF THE SECRET WAS THAT WHEN HE BEGAN TO MAKE HIS COLLECTION THESE THINGS WERE NOT VALUED
6563-63821-0022 USED TO SAY MEN GENERALLY GET IN THIS WORLD EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT HOW CAN THAT BE ASKED A YOUNGSTER ONE DAY
6563-63821-0023 BUT VERY FEW OF THEM EVER WILL BE I WANT A MILLION OR SO MYSELF AH BOY THE OLD MAN REPLIED YOU WANT A MILLION BUT YOU DON'T WANT IT ENOUGH WHAT YOU WANT AT PRESENT IS PLEASURE AND YOU WANT IT SO MUCH
6563-63821-0025 PETER FORCE WAS A VERY GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THE OLD MERCHANT'S DOCTRINE HE GOT ALL THESE PRECIOUS THINGS BECAUSE HE WANTED THEM WITH A SUSTAINED PASSION OF DESIRE FOR HALF A CENTURY THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN HE WOULD NOT HAVE GLADLY GOT UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
6563-63821-0026 AND WALKED TEN MILES IN THE FACE OF A NORTHEASTERLY STORM TO GET A RARE PAMPHLET OF FOUR PAGES HE WAS A MISER OF SUCH THINGS BUT NO THAT WORD DOES NOT DESCRIBE HIM FOR ONE OF THE GREATEST PLEASURES OF HIS LIFE
6563-63821-0028 DID I HESITATE BETWEEN A BARREL OF FLOUR AND A RARE BOOK BUT THE BOOK ALWAYS GOT THE UPPER HAND TO THE SAME FRIEND HE MADE A REMARK WHICH SHOWS THAT HIS DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WAS QUITE AS STRONG AS HIS DESIRE TO OBTAIN WHENEVER SAID HE
6563-63821-0029 I FOUND A LITTLE MORE MONEY IN MY PURSE THAN I ABSOLUTELY NEEDED I PUBLISHED A VOLUME OF HISTORICAL TRACTS IT WAS INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OLD MAN RELATE HOW THIS TASTE FOR THE TREASURES OF HISTORY WAS FORMED IN HIS MIND HIS FATHER
6563-63821-0031 LOVED TO HEAR THEM TELL THEIR STORIES AND AS HE LISTENED THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO HIM ONE EVENING WHY SHOULD ALL THIS BE FORGOTTEN BOY AS HE WAS HE BEGAN TO WRITE THEM DOWN UNDER THE TITLE OF THE UNWRITTEN HISTORY OF THE WAR IN NEW JERSEY
6563-63821-0032 HE MADE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE MANUSCRIPT WAS LOST THE TASTE THEN FORMED GREW WITH HIS GROWTH AND STRENGTHENED WITH HIS STRENGTH AT TEN HE LEFT SCHOOL FOREVER AND WENT INTO A PRINTING OFFICE
6563-63821-0034 THEN THE WAR OF EIGHTEEN TWELVE BEGAN LIKE HIS FATHER BEFORE HIM HE SERVED IN THE ARMY FIRST AS PRIVATE THEN AS SERGEANT THEN AS SERGEANT MAJOR THEN AS ENSIGN FINALLY AS LIEUTENANT THE WAR ENDED
6563-63821-0035 HE WENT TO WASHINGTON AS FOREMAN OF A PRINTING OFFICE AND AT WASHINGTON AS PRINTER EDITOR PUBLISHER AND COLLECTOR HE LIVED THE REST OF HIS LONG AND HONORABLE LIFE NEVER RICH AS I HAVE BEFORE REMARKED
6563-63821-0037 AND CONGRESS PAYING THE COST OF PUBLICATION THROUGH THE NINE VOLUMES OF THIS WORK A GREAT NUMBER OF THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING RECORDS AND MEMORIALS OF AMERICAN HISTORY ARE NOT ONLY PRESERVED BUT MADE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL STUDENTS WHO CAN GET NEAR A LIBRARY
6563-63821-0038 HE HAD ALL THE STATE HOUSES OF THE COUNTRY RANSACKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND A ROOM WAS ASSIGNED HIM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE IN WHICH HIS CLERKS COULD CONVENIENTLY COPY THEM ALL WENT WELL WITH THE WORK UNTIL WILLIAM MARCY BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE
6563-63821-0040 I DON'T BELIEVE IN YOUR WORK SIR SAID THE SECRETARY IT IS OF NO USE TO ANYBODY I NEVER READ A PAGE OF IT AND NEVER EXPECT TO BUT SAID MISTER FORCE THE WORK IS PUBLISHED IN VIRTUE OF A CONTRACT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
6563-63821-0041 HERE IS THE MANUSCRIPT OF THE TENTH VOLUME IF THERE IS ANYTHING THERE WHICH YOU THINK OUGHT NOT TO BE THERE HAVE THE GOODNESS TO POINT IT OUT TO ME YOU MAY LEAVE THE PAPERS SIR SAID THE SECRETARY HE LEFT THE PAPERS
6563-63821-0043 AND THEN THE WAR OCCURRED AND ALL SUCH MATTERS WERE NECESSARILY PUT ASIDE HE WAS NOW SEVENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE AND HIS GREAT DESIRE WAS TO DISPOSE OF HIS LIBRARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS TREASURES WOULD NOT BE SCATTERED ABROAD
6563-63821-0044 AND PERHAPS LOST FOREVER TO THE COUNTRY AT LENGTH CONGRESS HAVING SANCTIONED THE ENLARGEMENT OF THEIR OWN LIBRARY THEIR LIBRARIAN MISTER SPOFFORD INDUCED THEM TO PURCHASE THE WHOLE MASS JUST AS IT STOOD
6563-63821-0046 IN THE SEVENTY EIGHTH YEAR OF HIS AGE ENJOYING ALMOST TO THE LAST TWO OF THE THINGS HE LOVED BEST HIS BOOKS
6563-285357-0000 THIS IMPERIAL APPRECIATION OF WHAT HAD BEEN ACCOMPLISHED PROVED TO BE THE TURNING POINT IN THE INVENTOR'S FORTUNES IT STIMULATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND THE SECOND AIRSHIP WAS TAKEN IN HAND BUT MISFORTUNE STILL PURSUED HIM
6563-285357-0002 WAS EXPENDED BEFORE THE SHIP COULD TAKE TO THE AIR A FURTHER CRASH AND BLASTING OF CHERISHED HOPES APPEARED IMMINENT BUT AT THIS MOMENT ANOTHER ROYAL PERSONAGE CAME TO THE INVENTOR'S AID THE KING OF WURTEMBERG
6563-285357-0003 TOOK A PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIS SUBJECT'S UPHILL STRUGGLE AND THE WURTEMBERG GOVERNMENT GRANTED HIM THE PROCEEDS OF A LOTTERY WITH THIS MONEY AND WITH WHAT HE SUCCEEDED IN RAISING BY HOOK AND BY CROOK AND BY MORTGAGING HIS REMAINING PROPERTY
6563-285357-0005 HAVING AN AGGREGATE CAPACITY OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND CUBIC FEET OF HYDROGEN WAS EQUIPPED WITH TWO EIGHTY FIVE HORSE POWER MOTORS DRIVING FOUR PROPELLERS AND DISPLACED NINE TONS ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS INCIDENTAL TO THE PREVIOUS CRAFT
6563-285357-0006 HAD BEEN ELIMINATED WHILE THE SHIP FOLLOWED IMPROVED LINES IN ITS MECHANICAL AND STRUCTURAL DETAILS THE TRIALS WITH THIS VESSEL COMMENCED ON NOVEMBER THIRTIETH NINETEEN O FIVE BUT ILL LUCK HAD NOT BEEN ELUDED
6563-285357-0008 SHE WAS DRIVEN DEEPER INTO THE LAKE THE VESSEL ONLY BEING SAVED BY HURRIED DEFLATION SIX WEEKS WERE OCCUPIED IN REPAIRS BUT ANOTHER ASCENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY SEVENTEENTH NINETEEN O SIX THE TRIALS WERE FAIRLY SATISFACTORY
6563-285357-0009 BUT INCONCLUSIVE ONE OF THE MOTORS WENT WRONG AND THE LONGITUDINAL STABILITY WAS FOUND TO BE INDIFFERENT THE VESSEL WAS BROUGHT DOWN AND WAS TO BE ANCHORED BUT THE FATES RULED OTHERWISE A STRONG WIND CAUGHT HER DURING THE NIGHT
6563-285357-0011 AND ARRANGEMENTS TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE THEREOF INCORPORATED IN THE SUCCEEDING CRAFT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER AS SOON AS ONE DEFECT WAS REMEDIED ANOTHER ASSERTED ITSELF IT WAS THIS PERSISTENT REVELATION OF THE UNEXPECTED
6563-285357-0012 WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER PERIOD OF INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS HIS INVENTION PROBABLY NOTHING MORE WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARD OF THE ZEPPELIN AFTER THIS LAST ACCIDENT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE INTERVENTION OF THE PRUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AT THE DIRECT INSTIGATION OF THE KAISER
6563-285357-0014 AND COULD COVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILES WITHIN THIS PERIOD THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REPAY THE WHOLE OF THE MONEY HE HAD LAVISHED UPON HIS IDEA AND LIQUIDATE ALL THE DEBTS HE HAD INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH ANOTHER CRAFT WAS BUILT LARGER THAN ITS PREDECESSORS
6563-285357-0015 AND EQUIPPED WITH TWO MOTORS DEVELOPING ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HORSE POWER UPON COMPLETION IT WAS SUBMITTED TO SEVERAL PRELIMINARY FLIGHTS WHICH WERE SO EMINENTLY SUCCESSFUL THAT THE INVENTOR DECIDED TO MAKE A TRIAL TRIP UNDER CONDITIONS CLOSELY ANALOGOUS
6563-285357-0017 THE COUNT CONSIDERED THAT THE OFFICIAL AWARD WAS WITHIN REACH AND THAT ALL HIS PREVIOUS DISASTERS AND MISFORTUNES WERE ON THE EVE OF REDEMPTION THE CRUCIAL TEST WAS ESSAYED ON AUGUST FIFTH NINETEEN O EIGHT ACCOMPANIED BY TWELVE OBSERVERS
6563-285357-0018 THE VESSEL ASCENDED AND TRAVELLED WITHOUT INCIDENT FOR EIGHT HOURS THEN A SLIGHT MISHAP DEMANDED ATTENTION BUT WAS SPEEDILY REPAIRED AND WAS IGNORED OFFICIALLY AS BEING TOO TRIVIAL TO INFLUENCE THE MAIN ISSUE VICTORY APPEARED WITHIN
6563-285357-0020 AS IF INFURIATED AT THE CONQUEST ROSE UP IN REBELLION A SUDDEN SQUALL STRUCK THE UNWIELDY MONSTER WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS IT BECAME UNMANAGEABLE AND THROUGH SOME INSCRUTABLE CAUSE IT CAUGHT FIRE WITH THE RESULT THAT WITHIN A FEW MOMENTS
6563-285357-0021 IT WAS REDUCED TO A TANGLED MASS OF METALLIC FRAMEWORK IT WAS A CATASTROPHE THAT WOULD HAVE COMPLETELY VANQUISHED MANY AN INVENTOR BUT THE COUNT WAS SAVED THE GALL OF DEFEAT HIS FLIGHT WHICH WAS REMARKABLE INASMUCH AS HE HAD COVERED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILES
6563-285357-0023 APPRECIATED HIS GENIUS AND PROMPTLY POURED FORTH A STREAM OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO ENABLE HIM TO BUILD ANOTHER VESSEL THE INTIMATION THAT OTHER POWERS HAD APPROACHED THE COUNT FOR THE ACQUISITION OF HIS IDEA BECAME KNOWN FAR AND WIDE
6563-285357-0024 TOGETHER WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE HAD UNEQUIVOCALLY REFUSED ALL OFFERS HE WAS STRIVING FOR THE FATHERLAND
6563-285357-0026 BY COLLIDING WITH A TREE THE FINAL INCIDENT PASSED UNNOTICED
6563-285357-0027 IT HAD AN AIRSHIP WHICH COULD GO ANYWHERE IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND IN TRUE TEUTON PERSPECTIVE THE CRAFT WAS VIEWED FROM THE MILITARY STANDPOINT HERE WAS A MEANS OF OBTAINING THE MASTERY OF THE AIR
6563-285357-0029 AND IN THIS APPRECIATION THE POPULACE WHOLEHEARTEDLY CONCURRED WHETHER SUCH A PANEGYRIC FROM SUCH AN AUSPICIOUS QUARTER IS PRAISE INDEED OR THE EQUIVALENT OF COMPLETE CONDEMNATION HISTORY ALONE WILL BE ABLE TO JUDGE
6563-285357-0030 BUT WHEN ONE REFLECTS AT THIS MOMENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THIS AIRCRAFT DURING THE PRESENT CONFLAGRATION THE UNPREJUDICED WILL BE RATHER INCLINED TO HAZARD THE OPINION THAT IMPERIAL TEUTON PRAISE IS A SYNONYM FOR DAMNATION
6563-285357-0032 HAVE ENJOYED MORE THAN AN EVANESCENT EXISTENCE
6563-285357-0033 THAN ITS PREDECESSOR BUT THE TEUTONIC NATION HAS BEEN INDUCED TO PIN ITS WHOLE FAITH ON THIS AIRSHIP NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE MORE LEVELHEADED ENGINEERS OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED THE CRAFT TO BE A MECHANICAL MONSTROSITY CONDEMNED FROM ITS DESIGN
6563-285357-0035 THIS BLIND CHILD LIKE FAITH HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZEPPELIN FACTORIES AT FRIEDRICHSHAFEN THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO PRODUCE TWO OF THESE VESSELS PER MONTH WHILE ANOTHER FACTORY OF A SIMILAR CAPACITY
6563-285357-0036 HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AT BERLIN UNFORTUNATELY SUCH BIG CRAFT DEMAND LARGE DOCKS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND IN TURN A LARGE STRUCTURE OF THIS CHARACTER CONSTITUTES AN EASY MARK FOR HOSTILE ATTACK AS THE RAIDING AIRMEN OF THE ALLIES HAVE
6563-285357-0038 EQUALLY BRILLIANT FEATS SINCE THAT DATE IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT EACH ASTOUNDING ACHIEVEMENT HAS BEEN ATTENDED BY AN EQUALLY STUPENDOUS ACCIDENT BUT THAT IS ACCEPTED AS A MERE INCIDENTAL DETAIL BY THE FAITHFUL TEUTONIC NATION
6563-285357-0039 MANY VIVID PROPHECIES OF THE FORTHCOMING FLIGHTS BY ZEPPELIN HAVE BEEN UTTERED AND IT IS QUITE PROBABLE THAT MORE THAN ONE WILL BE FULFILLED BUT SUCCESS WILL BE ATTRIBUTABLE RATHER TO ACCIDENT THAN DESIGN
6563-285357-0041 GROSS CRAFT HAVE MET WITH WHOLE HEARTED SUPPORT SINCE THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR VALUE AS VESSELS OF THE AIR WHICH IS TANTAMOUNT TO THE ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR MILITARY VALUE THE PARSEVAL IS PRONOUNCED BY EXPERTS TO BE THE FINEST EXPRESSION OF AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING
6563-285357-0042 SO FAR AS TEUTON EFFORT IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY IT HAS PLACED MANY NOTABLE FLIGHTS TO ITS CREDIT THE GROSS AIRSHIP IS AN EQUALLY SERVICEABLE CRAFT
6563-285357-0044 ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVED THEIR SERVICEABILITY MORE OR LESS CONCLUSIVELY
6818-68772-0000 CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE BOOMERANG THE LAWN FETE WAS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS AND EVERY FARMER'S WIFE WAS PROUD OF HER SATIN BADGE BEARING THE MONOGRAM W P L AND THE WORDS
6818-68772-0002 BUT THEY ATE THE DAINTIES WITH A WISE DISREGARD OF THEIR INEXPERIENCE AND ENJOYED THEM IMMENSELY THE OLD BUTLER WAS A GENERAL IN HIS WAY AND IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE STAFF OF SERVANTS AT ELMHURST
6818-68772-0003 WAS INSUFFICIENT TO COPE WITH SUCH A THRONG HE ALLOWED LOUISE TO IMPRESS SEVERAL FARMERS DAUGHTERS INTO SERVICE AND WAS ABLE TO FEED EVERYONE WITHOUT DELAY AND IN AN ABUNDANT AND SATISFACTORY MANNER
6818-68772-0005 THE SILENT ATTENTION OF HER HEARERS PERMITTED HER TO BE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD SHE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT THIS CAMPAIGN WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT PROMISED MORE BEAUTIFUL AND ATTRACTIVE HOUSES FOR THE FARMERS AND TOWNSMEN ALIKE
6818-68772-0006 WE HAD ALL GROWN SO ACCUSTOMED TO ADVERTISING SIGNS SHE SAID THAT WE FAILED TO NOTICE HOW THICK THEY WERE BECOMING OR HOW BOLD AND OVERPOWERING FROM A FEW SCATTERED ANNOUNCEMENTS ON FENCE BOARDS
6818-68772-0008 EVERY COUNTRY ROAD BECAME AN ADVERTISING AVENUE SCARCELY A COUNTRY HOUSE WAS FREE FROM SIGNS OF SOME SORT YET THE PEOPLE TAMELY SUBMITTED TO THIS IMPOSITION BECAUSE THEY KNEW NO WAY TO AVOID IT
6818-68772-0009 WHEN MISTER FORBES BEGAN HIS CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE THE HOMESTEADS TO THEIR FORMER BEAUTY AND DIGNITY A CRY WAS RAISED AGAINST HIM BUT THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FARMERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH THIS REFORM MEANT TO THEM
6818-68772-0011 WE BELIEVE THAT NONE OF YOU WILL EVER CARE TO ALLOW ADVERTISING SIGNS ON YOUR PROPERTY AGAIN AND THAT THE QUIET REFINEMENT OF THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL INDUCE MANY OTHER PLACES TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE
6818-68772-0012 UNTIL ADVERTISERS ARE FORCED TO CONFINE THEMSELVES TO NEWSPAPERS MAGAZINES AND CIRCULARS THEIR ONLY LEGITIMATE CHANNELS THIS MUCH MISTER FORBES HAS ALREADY DONE FOR YOU AND HE WILL NOW TELL YOU WHAT ELSE IF HE IS ELECTED
6818-68772-0014 IF HE HONESTLY DESIRED TO DO SO THAT WAS WHAT A REPRESENTATIVE WAS FOR TO REPRESENT HIS PEOPLE IT WAS FOLLY TO ELECT ANY MAN WHO WOULD FORGET THAT DUTY AND PROMOTE ONLY HIS OWN INTERESTS THROUGH THE POSITION OF POWER TO WHICH THE PEOPLE HAD APPOINTED HIM
6818-68772-0015 MISTER FORBES ADMITTED THAT HE HAD UNDERTAKEN THIS CAMPAIGN BECAUSE HE WAS OPPOSED TO OFFENSIVE ADVERTISING SIGNS BUT NOW HE HAD BECOME INTERESTED IN OTHER ISSUES AND WAS ANXIOUS TO BE ELECTED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY ON THE WORK OF REFORM
6818-68772-0017 STANDING SHIELDED BEHIND THE HALF CLOSED BLIND OF AN UPPER WINDOW AND LISTENING TO AS WELL AS WATCHING THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW THE GIRL HAD BEEN LAUGHING AND TALKING WITH MISTER HOPKINS WHEN SHE FIRST SAW HER
6818-68772-0018 HER FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO DENOUNCE THE MAID AT ONCE AND HAVE HER DISCHARGED BUT THE TIME WAS NOT OPPORTUNE SO SHE WAITED UNTIL THE FESTIVITIES WERE ENDED
6818-68772-0020 INDEED THERE WERE MORE KINDLY THOUGHTS EXPRESSED FOR THE INHABITANTS OF ELMHURST THAN HAD EVER BEFORE BEEN HEARD IN A SINGLE DAY IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTY AND THE GREAT AND THE HUMBLE SEEMED MORE CLOSELY DRAWN TOGETHER
6818-68772-0021 WHEN THE LAST GUEST HAD DEPARTED BETH GOT HER COUSINS AND KENNETH TOGETHER AND TOLD THEM OF HER DISCOVERY OF THE SPY KENNETH WAS AT FIRST GREATLY ANNOYED AND PROPOSED TO CALL MARTHA AND HAVE THE FALSE MAID EJECTED FROM THE PREMISES
6818-68772-0023 AND THERE MAY BE A WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THIS UNSCRUPULOUS HOPKINS AND TURN THE INCIDENT TO OUR OWN ADVANTAGE LET'S THINK IT OVER CAREFULLY BEFORE WE ACT THERE'S ANOTHER THING SAID BETH SUPPORTING HER COUSIN
6818-68772-0024 I'M INTERESTED IN THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE GIRL I NOW THINK I WAS WRONG IN SUSPECTING HER TO BE THE LOST LUCY ROGERS BUT THERE IS SURELY SOME ROMANCE CONNECTED WITH HER AND SHE IS NOT WHAT SHE SEEMS TO BE
6818-68772-0026 THAT ISN'T IMPORTANT REPLIED LOUISE IT IS PROBABLY A MERE COINCIDENCE NONE OF US HAVE EVER SEEN THE REAL LUCY AND SHE MAY NOT RESEMBLE HER MOTHER AT ALL MISSUS ROGERS CLAIMS SHE DOES SAID BETH BUT ANYHOW
6818-68772-0027 I HAVE A WISH TO KEEP THIS GIRL AT THE HOUSE WHERE I CAN STUDY HER CHARACTER THEN KEEP HER MY DEAR DECIDED KENNETH I'LL SET A COUPLE OF MEN TO WATCH THE GATES AND IF SHE GOES OUT WE'LL KNOW WHOM SHE MEETS
6818-68772-0029 AND MEET MISTER HOPKINS IN THE LANE THEY CONVERSED TOGETHER A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN THE MAID CALMLY RETURNED AND WENT TO HER ROOM THE NEXT DAY MISTER HOPKINS SCATTERED FLARING HAND BILLS OVER THE DISTRICT
6818-68772-0030 THEY READ HOPKINS THE MAN OF THE TIMES IS THE CHAMPION OF THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES FORBES WHO NEVER EARNED A DOLLAR IN HIS LIFE BUT INHERITED HIS MONEY IS TRYING TO TAKE THE DOLLARS OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE FARMERS
6818-68772-0032 THEREFORE THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR THE HONORABLE ERASTUS HOPKINS FOR REPRESENTATIVE THEN FOLLOWED AN ESTIMATE OF THE MONEY PAID THE FARMERS OF THE DISTRICT BY THE ADVERTISERS DURING THE PAST FIVE YEARS
6818-68772-0033 AMOUNTING TO SEVERAL THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THE AGGREGATE THE CIRCULAR ENDED IN THIS WAY HOPKINS CHALLENGES FORBES TO DENY THESE FACTS HOPKINS IS WILLING TO MEET FORBES BEFORE THE PUBLIC AT ANY TIME AND PLACE HE MAY SELECT
6818-68772-0035 AT THE FAIRVIEW OPERA HOUSE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO DEBATE THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ADVERTISING SIGNS BROUGHT GOOD OR EVIL TO THE COMMUNITY THE CAMPAIGN WAS NOW GETTING HOT
6818-68772-0036 BECAUSE OF THE ACTIVITY OF THE OPPOSING CANDIDATES EVERY VOTER IN THE DISTRICT HAD BECOME MORE OR LESS INTERESTED IN THE FIGHT AND PEOPLE WERE TAKING ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH UNUSUAL EARNESTNESS
6818-68772-0038 BUT HE REMEMBERED HOW EASILY HE HAD SUBDUED KENNETH AT THE SCHOOL HOUSE MEETING BEFORE THE NOMINATIONS AND HAD NO DOUBT OF HIS ABILITY TO REPEAT THE OPERATION HE WAS MUCH INCENSED AGAINST THE GIRLS WHO WERE WORKING FOR KENNETH FORBES
6818-68772-0039 FOR HE REALIZED THAT THEY WERE PROVING AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE CAMPAIGN HE EVEN ATTRIBUTED TO THEM MORE THAN THEY DESERVED FOR UNCLE JOHN'S TELLING ACTIVITIES WERE SO QUIETLY CONDUCTED
6818-68772-0041 THE NEWSPAPERS HAVING BEEN SUBSIDIZED BY THE OPPOSITION SO EARLY IN THE GAME MISTER HOPKINS HAD DRIVEN TO EMPLOY THE CIRCULAR METHOD OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE VOTERS SCARCELY A DAY PASSED NOW THAT HIS CORPS OF DISTRIBUTORS
6818-68772-0042 DID NOT LEAVE SOME OF HIS LITERATURE AT EVERY DWELLING IN THE DISTRICT HIS TIRADE AGAINST THE GIRLS WAS NEITHER CONVINCING NOR IN GOOD TASTE HE ASKED THE VOTERS IF THEY WERE WILLING TO SUBMIT TO PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT AND PERMIT A
6818-68772-0044 BUT NO MAN OF SENSE WILL PERMIT A WOMAN TO INFLUENCE HIS VOTE IT IS A DISGRACE TO THIS DISTRICT THAT MISTER FORBES ALLOWS HIS GIRLISH CAMPAIGN TO BE RUN BY A LOT OF MISSES WHO SHOULD BE AT HOME DARNING STOCKINGS OR IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT
6818-68772-0045 IF I'M NOT MUCH MISTAKEN MISTER HOPKINS HAS THROWN A BOOMERANG EVERY WOMAN WHO ATTENDED THE FETE IS NOW LINKED WITH US AS AN ALLY AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL RESENT THIS FOOLISH CIRCULAR
6818-68772-0047 AND AT MISTER HOPKINS AND DECLARED THEY WERE NOT AT ALL OFFENDED ONE CANNOT TOUCH PITCH WITHOUT BEING DEFILED SAID MISTER WATSON GRAVELY
6818-68772-0048 AS MISTER HOPKINS KNOWS IT IS LITTLE MORE THAN PITCH I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING MY GIRLS HAVE DONE TO FORFEIT RESPECT AND ADMIRATION ASSERTED UNCLE JOHN STOUTLY TO ACCUSE THEM OF BOLDNESS OR IMMODESTY IS ABSURD
6818-76332-0000 CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE STRANGER AT THE DOOR MISSUS COLLINGWOOD REMAINED A LONG TIME UP STAIRS
6818-76332-0001 SO LONG INDEED THAT THE GIRLS BEGAN TO BE RATHER UNEASY FEARING THAT SHE HAD FAINTED OR PERHAPS WAS ILL OR OVERCOME
6818-76332-0003 I REALLY DON'T BELIEVE I'D HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AT LENGTH THEY HEARD HER COMING SLOWLY DOWN AND PRESENTLY SHE REENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM THEY COULD SEE THAT SHE WAS MUCH MOVED AND HAD EVIDENTLY BEEN CRYING
6818-76332-0004 SHE DID NOT SPEAK TO THEM AT ONCE BUT WENT AND STOOD BY THE MANTEL LOOKING UP LONG AND EARNESTLY AT THE PORTRAIT OF THE TWINS MY BABIES THEY HEARD HER MURMUR UNCONSCIOUSLY ALOUD
6818-76332-0006 I SUPPOSE YOU CONSIDER YOURSELVES ALMOST YOUNG LADIES BUT YOU SEE I AM AN OLD WOMAN I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT MY LIFE BUT I SUPPOSE YOU ALREADY KNOW MOST OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS
6818-76332-0007 SHE PATTED JOYCE'S HAND THERE ARE SOME THINGS HOWEVER THAT PERHAPS YOU DO NOT KNOW AND AFTER WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME YOU DESERVE TO I WAS MARRIED WHEN I WAS A VERY YOUNG GIRL
6818-76332-0009 LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
6818-76332-0010 IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
6818-76332-0012 WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
6818-76332-0013 I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
6818-76332-0015 AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
6818-76332-0016 AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
6818-76332-0018 WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
6818-76332-0019 TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
6818-76332-0021 HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
6818-76332-0022 I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
6818-76332-0024 THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
6818-76332-0025 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
6818-76332-0027 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
6818-76332-0028 I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
6818-76332-0030 AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0033 AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
6818-76332-0034 THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
6818-76332-0036 MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6818-76332-0039 THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
6818-76332-0040 MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
6818-76332-0042 BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
6818-76332-0043 SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
6818-76332-0045 THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
6818-76332-0046 YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
6818-76332-0048 BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
6818-76332-0049 BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
6818-76332-0051 THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
6818-76332-0052 HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
6818-76332-0054 ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6836-61803-0000 IT IS NOW EVENING AND THE SUNBEAMS FALLING ASLANT INTRUDE UPON THE SPACE CANOPIED BY THE TREE FROM THE GOLDEN BRIGHTNESS DISPLAYED BY THEM AT NOON
6836-61803-0001 AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
6836-61803-0003 IT WOULD SEEM AS IF HEAVEN'S WRATH WAS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THE PASSIONS OF EARTH MAURICE GERALD IS NO LONGER THE CYNOSURE OF THOSE SCOWLING EYES HE HAS BEEN CLAMOROUSLY ACQUITTED
6836-61803-0004 AND IS HENCEFORTH ONLY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE PLACE LATE OCCUPIED BY HIM ANOTHER STANDS CASSIUS CALHOUN IS NOW THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
6836-61803-0006 IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE EVIDENCE IS ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND THOUGH ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AS IN MOST CASES OF MURDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM A CHAIN IRRESISTIBLY CONCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE
6836-61803-0007 THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
6836-61803-0009 MUST HAVE ENSUED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AFTER HIS RECEIVING THE SHOT WHY SHOULD CASSIUS CALHOUN HAVE KILLED HIS OWN COUSIN WHY CUT OFF HIS HEAD NO ONE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
6836-61803-0010 SAVE THE MURDERER HIMSELF NO ONE EXPECTS HIM TO DO SO SAVE TO HIS MAKER BEFORE HIM HE MUST SOON STAND FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOTIVE IS NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO HIS CONDEMNATION
6836-61803-0012 THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6836-61803-0013 HE STARTS AT THE INVITATION FALLING AS IT DOES LIKE A DEATH KNELL UPON HIS EAR HE LOOKS WILDLY AROUND DESPAIRINGLY
6836-61803-0015 HIS CONFEDERATES THOSE PAYED RUFFIANS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SUPPORTED HIM ARE OF NO USE NOW AND THEIR SYMPATHY OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEY HAVE SHRUNK OUT OF SIGHT
6836-61803-0016 BEFORE THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW AND THE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT DESPITE HIS SOCIAL STANDING AND THE WEALTH TO SUSTAIN IT HE SEES HIMSELF ALONE WITHOUT FRIEND OR SYMPATHISER

6836-61803-0024 SHOT HIM DEAD IN THE CHAPPARAL
6836-61803-0025 AND EXPRESSES HORROR RATHER THAN INDIGNATION ALIKE INVOLUNTARY IS THE GROAN THAT GOES WITH IT PROCEEDING FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHOM ALL KNOW TO BE THE FATHER OF THE MURDERED MAN

6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE

6848-252323-0021 WHEN I HAVEN'T TUPPENCE TO BUY TOBACCO AND WITHOUT A SHOE TO MY FOOT AND MY HAIR THROUGH MY HAT I CAN BE DANCIN WID PRINCESSES AND HANDIN EMPRESSES IN TO TAY MUSHA MUSHA
6848-252323-0023 CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
6848-252323-0024 LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
6848-252323-0026 AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
6848-252323-0027 YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
6848-252323-0029 FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
6848-252323-0030 SO MUSICAL AND THE WORDS CAME DROPPIN DOWN LIKE THE CLEAR WATER FILTERIN OVER A ROCKY LEDGE AND GLITTERIN LIKE LITTLE SPANGLES OVER MOSS AND WILD FLOWERS IT WASN'T ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT SCOTCH BALLADS TOO AND ONCE OR TWICE IN ITALIAN THAT HE RECITED
6848-252323-0032 WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
6848-252323-0033 AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
6848-252323-0035 IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
6848-252323-0036 THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
6848-252323-0038 HE MADE ME COME ALONG AT HIS SIDE DISCOORSIN ME ABOUT MY THRAVELS AND ALL I SEEN AND ALL I READ TILL WE REACHED AN ELEGANT LITTLE COTTAGE ON A BANK RIGHT OVER THE LAKE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ME IN AND MADE ME TAKE TAY WITH THE FAMILY AND I SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
6848-252323-0039 AND FOR MANY AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN I JUST THINK OVER THEIR KIND WORDS AND PLEASANT FACES MORE THAN ONE OF THE COMPANY HAD DROPPED OFF ASLEEP DURING BILLY'S NARRATIVE AND OF THE OTHERS THEIR COMPLAISANCE AS LISTENERS APPEARED TAXED TO THE UTMOST
6880-216547-0000 THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0001 PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
6880-216547-0003 WHICH HAS JUST EXPIRED I NOW PROPOSE GENTLEMEN TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY
6880-216547-0004 WHEN I SOLICITED YOUR VOTES I BOLDLY AVOWED MY INTENTION TO BEND MY EFFORTS TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MEANS OF AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL
6880-216547-0006 YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007 MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0009 SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
6880-216547-0010 IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0012 HAS ALREADY REWARDED MY EFFORTS BUT GENTLEMEN OF ALL THE MASTERS WHOM I HAVE FOLLOWED TO NONE DO I OWE SO MUCH AS TO YOU
6880-216547-0013 YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
6880-216547-0015 TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0018 CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6880-216547-0019 YOUR PROGRAMME ALWAYS ORIGINAL AND VARIED IN ITS ACADEMICAL EXPRESSION BECAME MORE EXACT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HAD POINTED OUT AS THE CAUSES OR RATHER AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE SOCIAL MALADY
6880-216547-0021 THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022 WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0024 THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025 THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0030 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0031 CEASE TO HEED IT IN THE RACE IN THE TRIBE IN THE NATION CAN EQUALITY BY THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION BE PRESERVED BETWEEN CITIZENS AS WELL AS BETWEEN COUSINS AND BROTHERS
6880-216547-0033 WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034 IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0036 TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0037 TO THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY EVERY OTHER INTENTION IS FOREIGN TO AND EVEN ABUSIVE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN LIGHTLY OF JURISPRUDENCE I HAD THE RIGHT
6880-216547-0039 ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0040 AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
6880-216547-0042 THE CHURCH HAS ERRED IN DOGMA AND IN MORALS PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TESTIFY AGAINST HER IT MAY BE WRONG FOR ME TO SAY IT BUT SURELY IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TRUE
6880-216547-0043 TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0045 THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046 IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0048 I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
6880-216547-0049 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0052 IT IS FOR YOU NOW GENTLEMEN WHOSE MISSION AND CHARACTER ARE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRUTH IT IS FOR YOU TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE AND TO TELL THEM FOR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HOPE
6880-216547-0054 TO THEM THE LAWS OF THOUGHT ARE LIKE THE CONFINES OF THE POSSIBLE TO DAY THEY CAN NO MORE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SAVANT AND A SOPHIST THAN FORMERLY THEY COULD TELL A PHYSICIAN FROM A SORCERER
6880-216547-0055 INCONSIDERATELY ACCEPTING GATHERING TOGETHER AND ACCUMULATING EVERYTHING THAT IS NEW REGARDING ALL REPORTS AS TRUE
6880-216547-0057 MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0060 PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0061 TO EXAMPLE AND TO ITS OWN DIGNITY TO PUBLICLY DISAVOW ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ANTI SOCIAL DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IN CONSEQUENCE HE DEMANDS
6880-216547-0063 IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
6880-216547-0064 THAT THIS JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY BE PLACED UPON THE RECORDS THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS PUT TO VOTE ARE ADOPTED
6880-216547-0066 I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
6880-216547-0067 WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0069 MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
6880-216547-0070 AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0072 I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0073 THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0075 IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0076 I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
6880-216547-0078 WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0081 DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0082 HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
6880-216547-0084 YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
6880-216547-0085 AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0087 WHAT CHAGRIN I SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE FELT IF THE KING'S COUNSEL THAT IS TO SAY THE INTELLECTUAL EXECUTIONER HAD FOLLOWED IN MY VERY TRACKS TO ATTACK YOUR BOOK AND ANNOY YOUR PERSON
6880-216547-0088 I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0090 BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
6880-216547-0091 WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
6880-216547-0093 IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094 THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0096 AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
6880-216547-0097 SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
6880-216547-0099 WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
6880-216547-0100 YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0102 I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
6880-216547-0103 SO MUCH CONTROVERSY FATIGUES AND WEARIES ME THE INTELLIGENCE EXPENDED IN THE WARFARE OF WORDS IS LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN BATTLE IT IS INTELLIGENCE WASTED
6880-216547-0105 TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
6880-216547-0106 AN HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED IN MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN WHILE I CONSIDER THAT THIS FIGURE WILL BE A CIRCLE HONEST PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6880-216547-0108 TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
6880-216547-0109 IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
6880-216547-0111 THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0112 NOT ONLY MAY FIND A PLACE BUT MAY THEMSELVES SERVE AS INSTRUMENTS OF EQUALITY INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THE DIVISION OF POWER THE PUBLIC MINISTRY THE JURY SYSTEM
6880-216547-0114 A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6880-216547-0115 THE ROAD THAT HE SHALL TRAVERSE WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THE END
6925-80680-0001 AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
6925-80680-0002 IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A JACKAL ANSWERED THE QUEEN I SAY IT WAS A TIGER CRIED THE KING DON'T CONTRADICT ME NONSENSE SNAPPED THE QUEEN IT WAS A JACKAL AND THE DISPUTE WAXED SO WARM THAT THE KING SAID AT LAST VERY WELL
6925-80680-0004 SO THE KING CALLED THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM BUT WHILST THE DISPUTE WAS GOING ON THE KING AND QUEEN HAD GOT SO EXCITED AND TALKED SO LOUD THAT THE GUARDS HAD HEARD NEARLY ALL THEY SAID AND ONE MAN OBSERVED TO THE OTHER
6925-80680-0005 MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
6925-80680-0007 AND AWAY THE BEARERS WENT FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A DENSE WOOD
6925-80680-0008 AND STARTED HOME AGAIN NOW THE QUEEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT THE KING COULD NOT MEAN TO SEND HER AWAY FOR GOOD AND THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OVER HIS FIT OF TEMPER HE WOULD SUMMON HER BACK SO SHE STAYED QUITE STILL FOR A LONG TIME LISTENING WITH ALL HER EARS FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
6925-80680-0010 BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0011 WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
6925-80680-0013 YEARS PASSED WITHOUT A SIGN FROM THE KING HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR ALL HE SEEMED TO CARE THOUGH THE QUEEN STILL LIVED WITH THE FARMER AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD BY THIS TIME GROWN UP INTO A STRONG HANDSOME AND HEALTHY YOUTH OUT IN THE FOREST THEY SEEMED FAR FROM THE WORLD
6925-80680-0014 VERY FEW EVER CAME NEAR THEM AND THE PRINCE WAS CONTINUALLY BEGGING HIS MOTHER AND THE FARMER TO BE ALLOWED TO GO AWAY AND SEEK ADVENTURES AND TO MAKE HIS OWN LIVING BUT SHE AND THE WISE FARMER ALWAYS COUNSELLED HIM TO WAIT UNTIL
6925-80680-0016 A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
6925-80680-0017 MANY A WEARY MILE HE TRAMPED DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL ONE MORNING HE SAW BEFORE HIM JUST SUCH A FOREST AS THAT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED AND HE STEPPED JOYFULLY INTO IT LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO MEET AN OLD FRIEND
6925-80680-0019 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0020 THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE BRIGHTENED SHE SHOWED HIM WHERE TO SEEK THE WATER AND WHEN HE RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH HIS POT FILLED TO THE BRIM SHE LED THE WAY WITHOUT A WORD AND HE FOLLOWED IN A SHORT WHILE THEY CAME TO A HUT IN THE FOREST
6925-80680-0022 AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
6925-80680-0023 COME TO WHERE YOU NOW STAND AND CRY FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE OLD WOMAN'S SAYING AND MUCH OF THE LOVELY DAMSEL
6925-80680-0025 THE KING SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND WANTED NO MORE
6925-80680-0026 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
6925-80680-0028 BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
6925-80680-0029 BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
6925-80680-0031 BEING CAUGHT IN THE BRANCHES OF SOME FLOATING TREE THAT CAME TOSSING AND SWINGING DOWN THE STREAM AT LENGTH HE EMERGED PANTING AND DRIPPING WET ON THE OTHER SIDE CLOSE BY THE BANK STOOD A GALLOWS AND ON THE GALLOWS HUNG THE BODY OF SOME EVILDOER
6925-80680-0032 WHILST FROM THE FOOT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF SOBBING THAT THE KING HAD HEARD
6925-80680-0034 BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
6925-80680-0035 IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE OUT OF PITY MIGHT COME TO HER RESCUE SO WHEN AMEER ALI QUESTIONED HER SHE REPLIED AH KIND SIR IT IS MY POOR SON WHO HANGS UPON THAT GALLOWS HELP ME TO GET HIM DOWN AND I WILL BLESS YOU FOR EVER
6925-80680-0037 AND BENT SO THAT THE OLD WOMAN COULD CLAMBER ON TO HIS BACK WHICH SHE DID VERY NIMBLY THEN SUDDENLY HE FELT A NOOSE SLIPPED OVER HIS NECK
6925-80680-0038 BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
6925-80680-0040 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0041 AMEER ALI HIMSELF WAS ASTONISHED FOR HE HAD SLIPPED THE ANKLET INTO HIS POCKET IN THE DARK AND HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT SINCE THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AT ITS BEAUTY AND HAVING PRAISED AND REWARDED AMEER ALI HE GAVE THE ANKLET TO HIS DAUGHTER A PROUD AND SPOILED PRINCESS
6925-80680-0043 WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
6925-80680-0044 THAT WAS THE PARROT'S NAME HOW DO YOU THINK THE PRINCESS LOOKS IN HER NEW JEWEL THINK SNAPPED THE PARROT WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GIVEN HIM HIS BATH THAT MORNING I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER WITH ONE SHOE ON AND THE OTHER OFF
6925-80680-0046 OR SHE WOULD DIE OF SHAME SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0047 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0049 THEREFORE AWAY HE WENT AND AFTER A DAY'S TRAVELLING HE REACHED THE COTTAGE IN THE FOREST AND STANDING WHERE HE HAD STOOD WHEN THE OLD WOMAN CALLED TO HIM HE CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME HELP ME
6925-80680-0050 THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
6925-80680-0052 AND HOLD IT OVER THE CAULDRON AND EVERY DROP OF BLOOD THAT FALLS FROM IT INTO THE WATER WILL BECOME A JEWEL NEXT YOU MUST CHANGE THE WANDS SO THAT THE ONE THAT STOOD AT MY HEAD IS AT MY FEET AND THE ONE AT MY FEET STANDS AT MY HEAD AND PLACE THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IT WILL HEAL
6925-80680-0053 AND I SHALL BECOME QUITE WELL AGAIN AS BEFORE AT FIRST
6925-80680-0055 AND HE SAW EACH TURN IN THE WATER INTO SHINING GEMS HIS HEART TOOK COURAGE VERY SOON THERE WERE PLENTY OF JEWELS IN THE CAULDRON AND HE QUICKLY CHANGED THE WANDS PLACED THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IMMEDIATELY THE TWO PARTS BECAME ONE AS BEFORE
6925-80680-0056 THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
6925-80680-0058 AND STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THEM ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE MIRRORS THAT LINED HER ROOM
6925-80680-0059 AND NEVER RECOVERED HIS TEMPER UNTIL AFTER LUNCH SHE'S GOT ALL HER BEAUTY AT ONE END OF HER NOW IF SHE HAD A FEW OF THOSE FINE GEW GAWS ROUND HER NECK AND WRISTS SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER BUT NOW TO MY MIND
6925-80680-0061 AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
6925-80680-0062 AND AGAIN AMEER ALI SPENT NEARLY THE WHOLE MONTH SEARCHING FOR THE JEWELS BUT ALL IN VAIN AT LENGTH HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE HUT IN THE FOREST AND STOOD AND CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME
6925-80680-0064 AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
6925-80680-0065 FROM HER SEVERED HANDS AND HEAD THERE FELL INTO THE CAULDRON BRACELETS AND CHAINS OF RUBIES AND DIAMONDS
6925-80680-0067 WHEN ON THE DAY APPOINTED AMEER ALI PRODUCED A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PRICELESS THAN THE LAST THE KING'S ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JOY
6925-80680-0068 THE VERY NEXT MORNING SHE PUT ON ALL HER FINERY AND THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST THAT DISAGREEABLE PARROT COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HER APPEARANCE AND SHE LISTENED EAGERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY
6925-80680-0070 THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0071 SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND TOLD HIM THAT WITHIN A MONTH HE PROPOSED TO DO HIM THE HONOUR OF MARRYING HIM TO THE PRINCESS AND MAKING HIM HEIR TO THE THRONE ON HEARING THIS SPEECH
6925-80680-0073 AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
6925-80680-0074 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
6925-80680-0076 WELL HASTEN THEN SAID THE KING I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE FARMER HAS NOW LIVED AND ADMINISTERED JUSTICE LONG IN THIS CITY
6925-80680-0077 WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
6925-80680-0079 TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
6925-80680-0080 GROWING PALE AS HE LISTENED IN PRISON REPLIED THE FARMER IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL CLEAR THIS COURT OF THE JACKALS I WILL EXPLAIN CLEAR THE COURT COMMANDED THE KING AND VERY UNWILLINGLY THE VISITORS LEFT THE PALACE NOW
6925-80680-0082 AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
6925-80680-0083 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
6925-80680-0085 SHE SMILES AT HIM AND SAYS IS IT THE TIGER THEN OR THE JACKAL
7059-77897-0000 OH NO I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM SAID MISSUS MUNGER TOUCHING HER PONY WITH THE TIP OF HER WHIP LASH HE'S AN ODIOUS LITTLE CREATURE AND I KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO FOR THE DANCE AND SUPPER BECAUSE MISTER PECK WAS OPPOSED TO THEM HE'S ONE OF THE ANTI PECK PARTY IN HIS CHURCH
7059-77897-0002 IT THROWS A NEW LIGHT ON IT AND IF THAT'S THE WAY NICE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT WHY WE MUST GIVE UP THE IDEA I'M QUITE PREPARED TO DO SO BUT I WANT TO SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON FIRST MISSUS MUNGER SAID ANNIE UNEASILY
7059-77897-0003 I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
7059-77897-0005 COWED AND TROUBLED BY THE AFFAIR THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE SAID MISSUS MUNGER IMPARTIALLY ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO KEEP STILL I WILL PUT THE CASE TO HER SHE CHECKED THE PONY BEFORE THE BAR WHICH THE FLAGMAN AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING HAD LET DOWN
7059-77897-0006 WHILE A LONG FREIGHT TRAIN CLATTERED DEAFENINGLY BY AND THEN DROVE BUMPING AND JOUNCING ACROSS THE TRACKS I SUPPOSE YOU REMEMBER WHAT OVER THE TRACK MEANS IN HATBORO OH YES SAID ANNIE WITH A SMILE SOCIAL PERDITION AT THE LEAST
7059-77897-0008 BETWEEN THE HIGH WINDOWY BULKS OF THE SHOE SHOPS AND HAT SHOPS THE DUST GRADUALLY FREED ITSELF FROM THE CINDERS ABOUT THE TRACKS AND IT HARDENED INTO A HANDSOME NEWLY MADE ROAD BEYOND THE HOUSES OF THE SHOP HANDS
7059-77897-0009 THE LAWN BEFORE IT SLOPED DOWN TO THE ROAD WHERE IT ENDED SMOOTHLY AT THE BRINK OF A NEAT STONE WALL A BLACK ASPHALT PATH CURVED FROM THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED FROM THE STREET TO THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED TO THE HEAVY PORTICO
7059-77897-0011 MISSUS WILMINGTON WAS DRESSED IN A LIGHT MORNING DRESS WITH A WATTEAU FALL WHOSE DELICATE RUSSETS AND FADED REDS AND YELLOWS HEIGHTENED THE RICHNESS OF HER COMPLEXION AND HAIR WHY ANNIE SHE SAID HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
7059-77897-0012 AND YOU TOO MISSUS MUNGER HOW VURRY NICE HER WORDS TOOK VALUE FROM THE THICK MELLOW TONES OF HER VOICE AND PASSED FOR MUCH MORE THAN THEY WERE WORTH INTRINSICALLY
7059-77897-0014 MISTER WILMINGTON AND MISSUS MUNGER ARE OLD FRIENDS THE YOUNG FELLOW BOWED SILENTLY AND ANNIE INSTANTLY TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM HIS HEAVY JAW LONG EYES AND LOW FOREHEAD ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER A THICK BANG HE SAT DOWN CORNERWISE ON A CHAIR
7059-77897-0015 AND HAVING PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED MISSUS WILMINGTON IN FAVOUR OF THE GENERAL SCHEME ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THAT PART MISTER JACK WILMINGTON ANSWERED FOR HER I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD A RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ABOUT IT IT'S NONE OF THE HANDS BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO ASK THEM
7059-77897-0017 PUTTING OUT A SILENCING HAND IN THE DIRECTION OF THE YOUNG MAN DON'T YOU BE SO FAST YOU LET YOUR AUNTY SPEAK FOR HERSELF I DON'T KNOW ABOUT NOT LETTING THE HANDS STAY TO THE DANCE AND SUPPER MISSUS MUNGER YOU KNOW I MIGHT FEEL PUT UPON
7059-77897-0018 I USED TO BE ONE OF THE HANDS MYSELF YES ANNIE THERE WAS A TIME AFTER YOU WENT AWAY AND AFTER FATHER DIED WHEN I ACTUALLY FELL SO LOW AS TO WORK FOR AN HONEST LIVING I THINK I HEARD LYRA SAID ANNIE
7059-77897-0020 AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO DENY IT AS MISTER PUTNEY SAYS HE AND I HAVE OUR RECORD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY PRETENCES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER I OUGHT TO GO BACK ON MY FELLOW HANDS OH
7059-77897-0021 BUT MISSUS WILMINGTON SAID MISSUS MUNGER WITH INTENSE DEPRECATION THAT'S SUCH A VERY DIFFERENT THING YOU WERE NOT BROUGHT UP TO IT IT WAS JUST TEMPORARY AND BESIDES AND BESIDES
7059-77897-0023 BUT I GUESS I MUST OPPOSE THE LITTLE INVITED DANCE AND SUPPER ON PRINCIPLE WE ALL LIKE TO BE CONSISTENT AS ANNIE SAYS EVEN IF WE'RE INCONSISTENT IN THE ATTEMPT SHE ADDED WITH A LAUGH
7059-77897-0024 VERY WELL THEN EXCLAIMED MISSUS MUNGER WE'LL DROP THEM AS I SAID TO MISS KILBURN ON OUR WAY HERE IF MISSUS WILMINGTON IS OPPOSED TO THEM WE'LL DROP THEM OH AM I SUCH AN
7059-77897-0026 AND THEY'RE BOTH OPPOSED YOU'RE MERELY THE STRAW THAT BREAKS THE CAMEL'S BACK MISSUS WILMINGTON OH THANK YOU THAT'S A GREAT RELIEF
7059-77897-0027 WELL I MUST THINK ABOUT THAT AND I MUST ASK MISTER WILMINGTON JACK SHE CALLED OVER HER SHOULDER TO THE YOUNG MAN AT THE WINDOW DO YOU THINK YOUR UNCLE WOULD APPROVE OF ME AS JULIET'S NURSE
7059-77897-0029 SHE ADDED PULLING OUT HER WATCH BY ITS LEATHERN GUARD NOT TILL YOU'VE HAD LUNCH SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON RISING WITH THE LADIES YOU MUST STAY ANNIE I SHALL NOT EXCUSE YOU WELL
7059-77897-0030 WILL YOU JOIN US JACK NO I'M GOING TO THE OFFICE SAID THE NEPHEW BOWING HIMSELF OUT OF THE ROOM JACK'S LEARNING TO BE SUPERINTENDENT SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON LIFTING HER TEASING VOICE TO MAKE HIM HEAR HER IN THE HALL
7059-77897-0032 SAID MISSUS WILMINGTON CARELESSLY
7059-77900-0000 MISS NORTHWICK CALLED UPON ANNIE DURING THE WEEK WITH EXCUSES FOR HER DELAY AND FOR COMING ALONE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INTENTIONS OF BEING POLITE BUT SHE CONSTANTLY BETRAYED HER WANT OF INTEREST IN ANNIE AND DISAPPOINTED AN EXPECTATION OF REFINEMENT
7059-77900-0002 THE RELATION OF THE NORTHWICK FAMILY TO THE COMING ENTERTAINMENT AND AN IMPRESSION OF FRAIL MOTTLED WRISTS AND HIGH THIN CHEEKS AND AN ABSENCE OF MODELLING UNDER AFFLUENT DRAPERY WAS THE MAIN EFFECT OF MISS NORTHWICK'S VISIT WHEN ANNIE RETURNED IT
7059-77900-0003 SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
7059-77900-0005 AND MISSUS WILMINGTON PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOW HOW D'YE DO ANNIE SHE DRAWLED IN HER TENDER VOICE WON'T YOU COME IN YOU SEE I'M IN POSSESSION
7059-77900-0006 I'VE JUST GOT MY NEW PHAETON AND I DROVE UP AT ONCE TO CRUSH YOU WITH IT ISN'T IT A BEAUTY YOU'RE TOO LATE LYRA SAID ANNIE I'VE JUST COME FROM THE NORTHWICKS AND ANOTHER CRUSHING BEAUTY HAS GOT IN AHEAD OF YOUR PHAETON
7059-77900-0008 DO YOU MEAN IT LYRA DEMANDED ANNIE ARRESTED ON HER THRESHOLD BY THE CHARM OF THIS IMPROBABILITY WELL I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE OPPOSITES BUT UPON SECOND THOUGHTS YOU NEEDN'T COME IN ANNIE
7059-77900-0009 I WANT YOU TO TAKE A DRIVE WITH ME AND TRY MY NEW PHAETON SAID LYRA COMING OUT ANNIE NOW LOOKED AT IT WITH THAT IRRESOLUTION OF HERS AND LYRA COMMANDED GET RIGHT IN
7059-77900-0011 HE'S REALLY AT HOME NOW AND I DON'T MEAN AT THE HOUSE WHICH ISN'T HOME TO HIM BUT THE WORKS YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE WORKS EITHER HAVE YOU NO I HAVEN'T WELL THEN
7059-77900-0012 WE'LL JUST GO ROUND THERE AND KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE I OUGHT TO SHOW OFF MY NEW PHAETON TO MISTER WILMINGTON FIRST OF ALL HE GAVE IT TO ME IT WOULD BE KIND OF CONJUGAL OR FILIAL OR SOMETHING
7059-77900-0014 THEY CAME ROUND INTO THE REGION OF THE SHOPS AND LYRA CHECKED HER PONY IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND'S FACTORY IT WAS NOT IMPOSINGLY LARGE BUT AS MISSUS WILMINGTON CAUSED ANNIE TO OBSERVE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE HAT SHOPS AND AS UGLY AS THE SHOE SHOPS
7059-77900-0015 THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
7059-77900-0017 WHERE HER HUSBAND SAT WRITING AT A TABLE GEORGE I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS KILBURN
7059-77900-0018 WITH THE HABIT HE HAD OF TOUCHING IT THERE WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE MADE ANNIE THINK OF A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AT THE CREAM I'VE BEEN HOPING TO CALL WITH MISSUS WILMINGTON TO PAY MY RESPECTS BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY A GREAT DEAL THIS SEASON AND AND
7059-77900-0020 AND STAYING HIMSELF WITH A SHAKING HAND UPON IT LYRA INTERRUPTED THEM WELL I THINK NOW THAT ANNIE IS HERE WE'D BETTER NOT LET HER GET AWAY WITHOUT SHOWING HER THE WORKS OH OH DECIDEDLY
7059-77900-0021 I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
7059-77900-0023 AND THE FIRST ROOM WAS LIKE WHAT ANNIE HAD SEEN BEFORE IN COTTON FACTORIES WITH A FAINT SMELL OF OIL FROM THE MACHINERY AND A FINE SNOW OF FLUFF IN THE AIR AND CATCHING TO THE WHITE WASHED WALLS AND THE FOUL WINDOW SASHES
7059-77900-0024 THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
7059-77900-0026 FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
7059-77900-0027 EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
7059-77900-0029 AND HERE'S WHERE I FIRST MET MISTER WILMINGTON THE PLACE IS FULL OF ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS THE STOCKINGS ARE ALL ONE SIZE ANNIE
7059-77900-0030 I DON'T WELL THEY'RE NOT DREAMS EXACTLY ANNIE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE MILL SHE ASKED ANNIE TO COME HOME TO TEA WITH HER SAYING
7059-77900-0032 AND REMAINED SHUT IN THERE ANNIE WAS UNEASILY AWARE OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LYRA HAD APPARENTLY NO MORE DISTURBANCE FROM HIS ABSENCE THAN FROM HIS PRESENCE WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED WITH A FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING IT SUGGESTED
7059-77900-0033 SHE TALKED FREELY OF HER MARRIAGE NOT AS IF IT WERE LIKE OTHERS BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS SHE SHOWED ANNIE OVER THE HOUSE AND SHE ENDED WITH A DISPLAY OF THE RICH DRESSES WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS BUYING HER AND WHICH SHE NEVER WORE BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
7059-77900-0035 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE POKED INTO A HOTEL SO I STAY IN HATBORO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VILLAGE GIRL AND DID NOT MISS THE INTERESTS OF A LARGER LIFE AS SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THEM IN SOUTH HATBORO OR WANT THE BOTHER OF THEM
7059-77900-0036 SHE SAID SHE STUDIED MUSIC A LITTLE AND CONFESSED THAT SHE READ A GOOD DEAL NOVELS MOSTLY THOUGH THE LIBRARY WAS HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED WITH WELL BOUND GENERAL LITERATURE AT MOMENTS IT ALL SEEMED NO HARM
7059-77900-0038 WITH THE SUPERFLUITY WHICH IT INVOLVED NO SELF DENIAL TO GIVE FROM BUT MISTER PECK HAD GIVEN HER A POINT OF VIEW AND THOUGH SHE BELIEVED SHE DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
7059-77900-0039 OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
7059-77900-0041 OH IT'S AT THE REHEARSALS YOU KNOW THAT THE FUN IS
7059-77900-0042 ANNIE LAY AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIKE LYRA IF SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF HER AND THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME TO TEA WITH HER AND SPENT THE EVENING WITH HER UNLESS SHE FULLY RESPECTED HER
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
7067-76047-0000 AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
7067-76047-0002 AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
7067-76047-0003 SHE COULD FOR EXAMPLE BE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE LUGGAGE AND SENT ON BY TRAIN I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REALIZE HOW THE LAND LIES IN THAT QUARTER IT NEEDS ONLY A WORD TO MISS GRAMMONT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
7067-76047-0005 SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
7067-76047-0006 ON THE SECOND OCCASION SIR RICHMOND SMILED AGAIN FRANKLY SAID THE DOCTOR THIS ADVENTURE IS ALTOGETHER UNCONGENIAL TO ME IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THIS HIGHWAY COUPLING
7067-76047-0008 BUT ISN'T YOUR ATTITUDE RATHER UNFAIR UNJUST INDEED AND ALMOST INSULTING TO THIS MISS GRAMMONT AFTER ALL SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL POSITION INDEED
7067-76047-0009 SHE DOESN'T STRIKE YOU DOES SHE AS AN UNDIGNIFIED OR HELPLESS HUMAN BEING HER MANNERS SUGGEST A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE SELF CONTROL AND KNOWING LESS OF ME THAN YOU DO SHE PROBABLY REGARDS ME AS ALMOST AS SAFE AS A MAIDEN AUNT SAY
7067-76047-0011 AM I SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND BROUGHT A SCRUTINIZING EYE TO BEAR ON SIR RICHMOND'S FACE I WANT TO GO ON TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT FOR A DAY OR SO SIR RICHMOND ADMITTED THEN I SHALL PREFER TO LEAVE YOUR PARTY
7067-76047-0012 THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE I AM REALLY VERY SORRY TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS DILEMMA SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH A NOTE OF GENUINE REGRET IN HIS VOICE IT IS NOT A DILEMMA SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF ASPERITY
7067-76047-0014 I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
7067-76047-0015 BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0017 BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A NEW AGE YET WE ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP RUINS OF A VERY OLD ONE AND YOU IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP REMAINS OF A LIFE THAT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS COMPLICATIONS
7067-76047-0018 THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
7067-76047-0020 AND IN MANY WAYS INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER I HAVE NOT BEEN FAVOURED WITH VERY MUCH OF HER ATTENTION BUT THAT FACT HAS ENABLED ME TO SEE HER IN PROFILE
7067-76047-0021 MISS SEYFFERT IS A FAIRLY CRUDE MIXTURE OF FRANKNESS INSINCERITY AND SELF EXPLANATORY EGOTISM AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISREGARD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION SHE HAS ADDRESSED TO ME
7067-76047-0023 WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
7067-76047-0024 HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
7067-76047-0026 IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
7067-76047-0027 TALKED ABOUT BUT NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY AND RATHER BORED RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR THEORETICALLY SHE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME I THINK THIS MUST BE NEAR THE TRUTH OF HER BIOGRAPHY SAID SIR RICHMOND
7067-76047-0029 SHE HAD THE FLATTERY OF AN EXTREMELY UNCRITICAL AND UNEXACTING ADMIRATION THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT GRATIFIES A SILLY WOMAN EXTREMELY MISS GRAMMONT IS NOT SILLY
7067-76047-0030 PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
7067-76047-0032 WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND WHAT WOULD A RICH GIRL FIND OUT THERE IN AMERICA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THE MATERIAL TO GUESS WITH IN LONDON A GIRL MIGHT FIND A CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF ACTIVE INTERESTING MEN RISING POLITICIANS UNIVERSITY MEN OF DISTINCTION
7067-76047-0033 SHE WOULD FIND THAT LIFE WAS WORTH WHILE TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MADE THE ORDINARY ENTERTAINMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HER LIFE A MONSTROUS SILLY WASTE OF TIME WITH THE FACILITY OF HER SEX SHE WOULD PICK UP FROM ONE OF THEM THE IDEA THAT MADE LIFE WORTH WHILE FOR HIM
7067-76047-0035 AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW THE WAR HAS TURNED AN UGLY FACE TO HER SHE HAS SEEN DEATH AND SUFFERING AND RUIN PERHAPS SHE HAS SEEN PEOPLE SHE KNEW KILLED PERHAPS THE MAN HAS BEEN KILLED
7067-76047-0036 OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
7067-76047-0038 SHE SEES HISTORY AS YOU SEE IT AND I SEE IT SHE IS A VERY GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN IT'S JUST THAT SAID SIR RICHMOND IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU SEE AS MUCH IN MISS GRAMMONT AS ALL THAT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME ON WITH US YOU SEE THE INTEREST OF HER
7067-76047-0039 I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
7067-76047-0041 YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
7067-76047-0042 YOU I SAY ARE ALSO AT LOOSE ENDS CAN YOU DENY IT MY DEAR SIR DON'T WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVER SINCE WE LEFT LONDON YOU HAVE BEEN READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY PRETTY THING IN PETTICOATS THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE YOU THREE HA'PORTH OF KINDNESS
7067-76047-0044 AS THE PHRASE GOES WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THERE WAS A PAUSE SIR RICHMOND LOOKED AT HIS TOES FOR A MOMENT OR SO AS IF HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THEM AND THEN DECIDED TO TAKE OFFENCE
7067-76047-0045 REALLY HE SAID THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS YOU TALK OF FALLING IN LOVE AS THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT AND THE GULF IN OUR AGES IN OUR QUALITY
7067-76047-0047 IS THERE NEVER TO BE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT PASSION YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I DO THAT THERE IS NOT FOR SUCH PEOPLE AS YOU TWO ANYHOW
7067-76047-0048 AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76048-0000 I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001 NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0003 AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004 BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0006 AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007 ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
7067-76048-0009 SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
7067-76048-0010 THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
7067-76048-0012 HER IMAGINATION GLOWED IN HER EYES AND WARMED HER VOICE I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY IS POSSIBLE IF PEOPLE DARE I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING LITTLE MOTIVES THAT ARE LIKE FLAMES THAT GO OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THEM
7067-76048-0013 I AM TIRED OF SEEING ALL THE WORLD DOING THE SAME I AM TIRED OF A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING GREAT BUT GREAT DISASTERS HERE IS SOMETHING MANKIND CAN ATTEMPT THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT AND WILL I BELIEVE THAT AS MANKIND GROWS UP
7067-76048-0015 SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0016 WHO HAVE IMAGINATIONS WANT SOMETHING MORE NOWADAYS OF COURSE WE WANT BRIGHT LIVES OF COURSE WE WANT HAPPINESS JUST AS WE WANT FOOD JUST AS WE WANT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE EATEN WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT WHEN WE HAVE JOLLY THINGS ABOUT US IT IS NOTHING
7067-76048-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE SO BUT I AM COMPELLED BY SOMETHING IN MY NATURE TO WANT TO SERVE THIS IDEA OF A NEW AGE FOR MANKIND I WANT IT AS MY CULMINATING WANT I WANT A WORLD IN ORDER
7067-76048-0019 A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
7067-76048-0021 IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
7067-76048-0022 DEVOTED TO HIS WORK AND HE'S WRITING A BOOK WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM IN THESE IDEAS ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE STOOD HERE AND TALKED ABOUT IT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE THE WORLD HE BELIEVES IS ENTERING UPON A NEW PHASE IN ITS HISTORY
7067-76048-0024 THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
7067-76048-0025 MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
7067-76048-0027 BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
7067-76048-0028 THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
7067-76048-0030 YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND SHE WENT ON THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO'D LOVE IT TOO WE'RE PETTED WE'RE KEPT OUT OF THINGS WE AREN'T PLACED
7067-76048-0031 WE DON'T GET ENOUGH TO DO WE'RE SPENDERS AND WASTERS NOT ALWAYS FROM CHOICE WHILE THESE FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS OF OURS PLAY ABOUT WITH THE FUEL AND POWER AND LIFE AND HOPE OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GAME OF POKER
7067-76048-0033 SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE TOOK UP THE THREAD OF SOME CONTROVERSY THAT HAD PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HER LIFE THAT ISN'T GOING ON SHE SAID WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCLUSIVE DECISION
7067-76048-0034 SIR RICHMOND RECALLED THAT LITTLE SPEECH NOW AS HE RETURNED FROM SALISBURY STATION TO THE OLD GEORGE AFTER HIS FAREWELL TO MARTINEAU HE RECALLED TOO THE SOFT FIRMNESS OF HER PROFILE AND THE DELICATE LINE OF HER LIFTED CHIN
7067-76048-0036 IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
7067-76048-0037 BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
7067-76048-0039 THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT SHE ATTACHED VERY MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER RECENTLY ACQUIRED VOTE SHE EVIDENTLY CLASSIFIED VOTERS INTO THE IRRESPONSIBLE WHO JUST HAD VOTES AND THE RESPONSIBLE WHO ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AS WELL
7067-76048-0040 SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POWER OF THE FORMER CLASS IT DIDN'T EXIST THEY WERE STEERED TO THEIR DECISIONS BY PEOPLE EMPLOYED DIRECTED OR STIMULATED BY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE OWNERS OF AMERICA THE REAL RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
7067-76048-0042 SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
7067-76048-0043 FATHER IT SEEMED VARIED VERY MUCH IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HE DESPISED AND DISTRUSTED WOMEN GENERALLY AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO HER HOW GRAVE AN ERROR IT WAS ON HER PART TO PERSIST IN BEING A DAUGHTER AND NOT A SON
7067-76048-0045 AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
7067-76048-0046 HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0048 SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049 THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0051 AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052 MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0054 THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0055 FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0057 AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0058 WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH SUCH TYPES AS FATHER AND TO FALL INTO AN IDIOM THAT ASSUMED A JOINT ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AGREED BY A TACIT CONSENT TO A COMMON CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD THEY DESIRED AS A WORLD SCIENTIFICALLY ORDERED
7067-76048-0060 AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
7078-271888-0000 WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0002 WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
7078-271888-0003 BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0005 UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0006 IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
7078-271888-0008 HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009 HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0011 THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0012 HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
7078-271888-0014 BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0015 THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
7078-271888-0017 AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
7078-271888-0018 BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0020 GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
7078-271888-0021 YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7078-271888-0023 HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
7078-271888-0024 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0026 YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0027 WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
7078-271888-0029 AND YOU AVENGE YOURSELF BY REVILING ALL OF US IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SHE SAID POUTING LIKE A SPOILED CHILD BY JOVE OLD FELLOW DICK CHIMED IN DO TELL US ABOUT YOUR ROMANCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE REASON
7078-271888-0030 YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
7078-271888-0032 THEN I LIT MY PIPE AND ONE BY ONE READ THEM THROUGH PAUSING AND PONDERING OVER THE DECLARATIONS OF PASSIONATE LOVE THEY CONTAINED FAR INTO THE NIGHT I SAT REVIEWING THE ROMANCE OF BYGONE DAYS UNTIL I CAME TO THE LAST LETTER
7078-271888-0033 IT WAS A COLD FORMAL NOTE MERELY A FEW LINES OF HURRIED SCRAWL AND READ YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE BEEN FALSE TO YOU THINK NO MORE OF ME BY THE TIME YOU RECEIVE THIS I SHALL BE ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK
7078-271888-0035 I STROVE TO FORGET THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWO AND MY READING LAMP WAS BURNING LOW AND SPUTTERING WHEN I ROSE TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT I CONFESS THAT MY FRAME OF MIND SURPRISED ME INASMUCH AS I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF
7078-271888-0036 STILL LOVING HER GOOD AFTERNOON I HOPE I DON'T DISTURB YOU LOOKING UP FROM MY WORK I SAW ETHEL NOT AT ALL PRAY SIT DOWN I SAID COLDLY
7078-271888-0038 WITH HER SHE HAD BROUGHT THE ODOUR OF VIOLETS THE SAME THAT I REMEMBERED YEARS AGO THE SAME PERFUME THAT ALWAYS STIRRED SAD MEMORIES WITHIN ME YOU DON'T WELCOME ME VERY WARMLY SHE SAID IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE
7078-271888-0039 AS SHE GRASPED MY HAND AND LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES NO I SAID STERNLY LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU THAT A WOMAN HAD EMBITTERED MY LIFE THE WOMAN I REFERRED TO WAS YOURSELF AH
7078-271888-0041 I HAVE BEEN ALMOST RUINED THINK OF YOUR ACTIONS ON THE DAY BEFORE YOU LEFT ME HOW YOU TOOK FROM THAT DRAWER A SIGNED BLANK CHEQUE WITH WHICH YOU DREW SIX HUNDRED POUNDS NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I POSSESSED AND THEN FLED WITH YOUR LOVER
7078-271888-0042 IS THAT THE WAY A WOMAN SHOWS HER AFFECTION HER HEAD WAS BOWED IN HUMILIATION FORGIVE ME HAROLD SHE SAID WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS I ADMIT THAT I WRONGED YOU CRUELLY THAT I DISCARDED THE HONEST LOVE YOU GAVE ME
7078-271888-0044 SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
7078-271888-0045 I ASKED HESITATING TO RECEIVE IT I HAVE EARNED IT HONESTLY EVERY PENNY SHE REPLIED SINCE WE PARTED I HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN AMERICA AND PLAYED LEAD IN NEARLY ALL THE GREAT CITIES
7078-271888-0047 HE CONTRACTED TYPHOID WHILE WE WERE PLAYING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT TERMINATED FATALLY ETHEL I SAID GRAVELY TAKING HER HAND IN MINE YOU HAVE FASCINATED DICK CARRUTHERS MY FRIEND
7078-271888-0048 AND YOU WILL TREAT HIM AS YOU TREATED ME NO NO I LOVE HIM SHE SAID IN A FIERCE HALF WHISPER ADDING
7078-271888-0050 PROMISE TO KEEP MY SECRET FOR THE PRESENT I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE I ANSWERED MY HEART SOFTENING TOWARDS HER BUT I CANNOT PROMISE THAT I WILL NEVER TELL HIM
7078-271888-0051 WHAT CHARACTER DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST SUIT ME WELL
7078-271888-0053 BUT I SAW VERY LITTLE OF DICK HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMISSION FROM ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS TO MAKE A SERIES OF SKETCHES OF SCENERY IN SCOTLAND
7078-271888-0054 WHENEVER HE PAID FLYING VISITS TO LONDON HOWEVER HE ALWAYS LOOKED ME UP BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NEVER MENTIONED ETHEL NEVERTHELESS I ASCERTAINED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY MET
7078-271888-0056 PIPE IN MOUTH AND CRAYON IN HAND BUSILY SKETCHING WHILE ON THE RAISED THRONE BEFORE HIM SAT ETHEL RADIANT AND BEAUTIFUL A TENDER SMILE PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT SEEMED AS THOUGH A HAPPINESS FULL COMPLETE
7078-271888-0057 PERFECTLY SATISFYING HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HERSELF OUT OF THE WORLD EVEN WELCOME OLD FELLOW DICK CRIED
7078-271888-0059 AND SHE WAVED THE GOBLET SHE WAS HOLDING ABOVE HER HEAD YOUR POSE IS PERFECT DEAR PLEASE DON'T ALTER IT URGED THE ARTIST WHO ADVANCING TO HIS EASEL AGAIN CONTINUED THE FREE RAPID OUTLINE
7078-271888-0060 PRESENTLY SHE REAPPEARED AND WE WENT TO DINE TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY AFTERWARDS VISITING A THEATRE AND SPENDING A VERY PLEASANT EVENING POOR DICK I WAS SORRY THAT HE WAS SO INFATUATED
7078-271888-0062 IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063 THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0065 HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM
7078-271888-0066 I WAS AMUSING MYSELF UNTIL YOUR RETURN I I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU WELL WHAT IS IT I ASKED RATHER SURPRISED CANNOT YOU GUESS DICK HAS ASKED ME TO BECOME HIS WIFE SHE SAID IN A LOW TONE
7078-271888-0068 I HAVE REFUSED REFUSED WHY FOR REASONS OF MY OWN
7078-271888-0069 IF IF HE SPEAKS TO YOU URGE HIM TO ABANDON THOUGHTS OF LOVE AND REGARD ME AS A FRIEND ONLY YOU ARE AT LEAST SENSIBLE ETHEL I SAID IT IS GRATIFYING TO KNOW THAT YOU RECOGNISE THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH AN UNION
7078-271888-0071 TO SHOW THEM THE PICTURE HE IS ABOUT TO SEND TO THE ACADEMY THE EXHIBITION IS IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THE SHOWING BEFOREHAND OF THE GARLANDS OF VICTORY IN A BATTLE WHICH IS DOOMED TO BE LOST FOR WHEN THE OPENING DAY COMES
7078-271888-0072 HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
7078-271888-0074 ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
7078-271888-0075 THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
7078-271888-0077 WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
7078-271888-0078 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT
7078-271888-0080 IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0081 A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
7078-271888-0083 MAY BRING YOU FAME AND FORTUNE IS THE MOST SINCERE HOPE OF YOUR MODELS ETHEL I WARNED YOU AGAINST YOUR INFATUATION OLD FELLOW I SAID SERIOUSLY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I I LOVED HER
7078-271888-0084 WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0086 THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
7078-271888-0087 AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0089 AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
7078-271888-0090 THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0092 YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
7078-271888-0093 TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0095 THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7078-271888-0096 AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
7078-271888-0098 A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
7078-271888-0099 I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
7078-271888-0101 ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
7078-271888-0102 METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
7078-271888-0104 AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST
7078-271888-0105 MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
7078-271888-0107 WE BOTH CRIED IN AMAZEMENT DICK SHE GASPED YOU YOU HAVE FOUND ME SHE REELED BACKWARDS AND BEFORE WE COULD SAVE HER FELL SENSELESS TO THE FLOOR A FEW WORDS OF EXCUSE
7078-271888-0108 AND EXPLANATION AND WE LEFT THE COUNT WHO KNEELING BESIDE HIS WIFE AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUSCITATE HER WAS COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED AT THE STRANGE RECOGNITION DICK ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF
7078-271888-0110 TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID
7078-271888-0111 DEAD I CRIED IMPOSSIBLE YES SIR HER MAID DISCOVERED HER IN HER BOUDOIR LATE LAST NIGHT AND FOUND THAT SHE HAD TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF MORPHIA WE SENT FOR THE DOCTOR
7078-271888-0113 AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
7078-271888-0114 IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT
7113-86041-0001 AND THE HOSTS OF GNOMES TO BE KEPT TO THEIR TASKS SOME BUILT STRONG BARRIERS TO HOLD BACK THE FIERY VAPOURS TO CHANGE DULL STONES TO PRECIOUS METAL OR WERE HARD AT WORK FILLING EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES
7113-86041-0002 FOR RUBEZAHL LOVED ALL PRETTY THINGS SOMETIMES THE FANCY WOULD TAKE HIM TO LEAVE THOSE GLOOMY REGIONS AND COME OUT UPON THE GREEN EARTH FOR A WHILE AND BASK IN THE SUNSHINE AND HEAR THE BIRDS SING
7113-86041-0004 TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
7113-86041-0005 AND IN THEIR PLACE APPEARED BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS SURROUNDING COSY LOOKING THATCHED COTTAGES FOR EVERY CHIMNEY THE BLUE SMOKE CURLED PEACEFULLY INTO THE AIR SHEEP AND OXEN FED IN THE FLOWERY MEADOWS
7113-86041-0007 NOR DID HE WISH TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR DOINGS BUT LEFT THEM IN QUIET POSSESSION OF THEIR HOMES AS A GOOD HOUSEHOLDER LEAVES IN PEACE THE SWALLOWS WHO HAVE BUILT THEIR NESTS UNDER HIS EAVES
7113-86041-0008 HE WAS INDEED GREATLY MINDED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THIS BEING CALLED MAN SO TAKING THE FORM OF AN OLD FIELD LABOURER HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A FARMER UNDER HIS CARE ALL THE CROPS FLOURISHED EXCEEDINGLY
7113-86041-0010 AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
7113-86041-0011 SO HE RAN AWAY AND WENT TO SERVE THE JUDGE HERE HE UPHELD THE LAW WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND WAS A TERROR TO THIEVES AND EVILDOERS BUT THE JUDGE WAS A BAD MAN WHO TOOK BRIBES AND DESPISED THE LAW
7113-86041-0013 WHERE STOOD A CHARMING MAIDEN FRESH AS THE SPRING AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON AROUND HER UPON THE GRASS LAY HER YOUNG COMPANIONS AS IF THEY HAD THROWN THEMSELVES DOWN TO REST AFTER SOME MERRY GAME
7113-86041-0014 BEYOND THEM FLOWED A LITTLE BROOK INTO WHICH A WATERFALL LEAPT FROM A HIGH ROCK FILLING THE AIR WITH ITS PLEASANT SOUND AND MAKING A COOLNESS EVEN IN THE SULTRY NOONTIDE
7113-86041-0016 HE COULD ONLY SEE WITH A RAVEN'S EYES AND FEEL AS A RAVEN FEELS AND A NEST OF FIELD MICE AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE INTERESTED HIM FAR MORE THAN THE SPORT OF THE MAIDENS
7113-86041-0017 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0019 BY THE BROOK TO REST OR TO BATHE IN THE COOL WATERS ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING THE FANCY TOOK THEM TO WANDER OFF AGAIN INTO THE WOOD THIS
7113-86041-0020 STEPPING OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE
7113-86041-0022 THE RED ROCKS HAD BECOME WHITE MARBLE AND ALABASTER THE STREAM THAT MURMURED AND STRUGGLED BEFORE IN ITS ROCKY BED FLOWED IN SILENCE NOW IN ITS SMOOTH CHANNEL FROM WHICH A CLEAR FOUNTAIN LEAPT
7113-86041-0023 AS THE WANDERING BREEZE SCATTERED IT DAISIES AND FORGET ME NOTS FRINGED ITS BRINK WHILE TALL HEDGES OF ROSES AND JASMINE RINGED IT ROUND MAKING THE SWEETEST AND DAINTIEST BOWER IMAGINABLE
7113-86041-0025 BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
7113-86041-0026 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN HIGH GLEE AND CALLING MERRILY TO EACH OTHER AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE QUITE WEARY THE PRINCESS CRIED OUT SUDDENLY THAT NOTHING WOULD CONTENT HER BUT TO BATHE IN THE MARBLE POOL
7113-86041-0028 AND VANISHED IN ITS DEPTHS BEFORE HER FRIGHTENED PLAYMATES COULD SEIZE HER BY SO MUCH AS A LOCK OF HER FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR LOUDLY DID THEY WEEP AND WAIL RUNNING ABOUT THE BRINK OF THE POOL WHICH LOOKED SO SHALLOW AND SO CLEAR
7113-86041-0029 BUT WHICH HAD SWALLOWED UP THEIR PRINCESS BEFORE THEIR EYES THEY EVEN SPRANG INTO THE WATER AND TRIED TO DIVE AFTER HER BUT IN VAIN THEY ONLY FLOATED LIKE CORKS IN THE ENCHANTED POOL AND COULD NOT KEEP UNDER WATER FOR A SECOND
7113-86041-0031 THE SCENE OF THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THINKING AS PEOPLE WILL IN SORROW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISTAKE AFTER ALL BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT BEHOLD ALL WAS CHANGED AGAIN
7113-86041-0032 THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
7113-86041-0034 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
7113-86041-0035 THEY SWAM WITH HER QUICKLY BY STRANGE UNDERGROUND WAYS TO A PALACE SO SPLENDID THAT HER FATHER'S SEEMED BUT A POOR COTTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH IT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED UPON A COUCH
7113-86041-0037 AND HIS GREAT UNDERGROUND KINGDOM AND PRESENTLY LED HER THROUGH THE MANY ROOMS AND HALLS OF THE PALACE AND SHOWED HER THE RARE AND WONDERFUL THINGS DISPLAYED IN THEM TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SPLENDOUR
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7113-86041-0041 AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
7113-86041-0043 CARROTS TURNIPS AND RADISHES AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY IN AN ELEGANT BASKET BROUGHT THEM TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAT PENSIVE IN THE SHADE OF THE ROSE BOWER LOVELIEST DAUGHTER OF EARTH SAID THE GNOME BANISH ALL SORROW
7113-86041-0044 NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
7113-86041-0046 THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
7113-86041-0047 AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
7113-86041-0049 AND SHOWED SO MUCH TASTE THAT NOBODY
7113-86041-0050 THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0053 THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
7113-86041-0055 TAKE PART IN THE GAMES OF THE PRINCESS TILL AT LAST ONE FINE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCESS STARTED FROM BED AND HASTENED OUT TO JOIN HER GAY PLAYFELLOWS SHE SHUDDERED
7113-86041-0056 AND STARTED BACK AT THE SIGHT OF A GROUP OF SHRIVELLED CRONES WITH BENT BACKS AND TREMBLING LIMBS WHO SUPPORTED THEIR TOTTERING STEPS WITH STAVES AND CRUTCHES AND COUGHED DISMALLY A LITTLE NEARER TO THE HEARTH
7113-86041-0058 THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
7113-86041-0059 SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
7113-86041-0061 AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
7113-86041-0062 AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
7113-86041-0064 BY THE TRELLIS OF GRAPE VINES SHE MET THE GNOME WHO WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSED AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT SHE BECAME AWARE OF HIS CONFUSION WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
7113-86041-0065 DEAR QUEEN OF MY HEART ANSWERED HE I PRAY YOU TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS I PROMISED MORE THAN I COULD PERFORM I HAVE SOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND FOR THE ROOTS YOU DESIRE BUT THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DRYING IN MUSTY CELLARS
7113-86041-0067 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0070 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0074 FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
7113-86041-0076 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0079 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0082 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0085 UNLESS HE COULD BE FOR EVER CHATTERING
7113-86041-0086 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0088 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0089 AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DECKED AS A BRIDE IN THE WONDERFUL ROBES AND JEWELS WHICH THE FOND GNOME HAD PREPARED FOR HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED AND CROWNED WITH MYRTLE BLOSSOMS
7113-86041-0091 YOUR CONSTANCY HAS OVERCOME ME SHE SAID I CAN NO LONGER OPPOSE YOUR WISHES BUT BELIEVE MY WORDS AND SUFFER THIS VEIL STILL TO HIDE MY BLUSHES AND TEARS WHY TEARS BELOVED ONE CRIED THE GNOME ANXIOUSLY
7113-86041-0092 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0097 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0098 PRETTY LOOKS AND WORDS AS FOR THE MAIDEN NO SOONER WAS HER DELUDED LOVER FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT THAN SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD A FINE FRESH TURNIP HIDDEN CLOSE AT HAND
7113-86041-0100 INTO THE ARMS OF HER BELOVED PRINCE RATIBOR MEANWHILE THE TOILING GNOME WENT THROUGH HIS TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE COULD NO LONGER PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0103 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0106 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0109 AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
7113-86041-0110 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
7148-7763-0001 IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0002 MIGHT TRULY BE CALLED AN OBJECT IN LIFE TO BE A REFORMER OF THE WORLD MY CONCEPTION OF MY OWN HAPPINESS WAS ENTIRELY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS OBJECT THE PERSONAL SYMPATHIES I WISHED FOR WERE THOSE OF FELLOW LABOURERS
7148-7763-0004 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0007 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT THE QUESTION DIRECTLY TO MYSELF SUPPOSE THAT ALL YOUR OBJECTS IN LIFE WERE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONS AND OPINIONS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
7148-7763-0008 THE WHOLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH MY LIFE WAS CONSTRUCTED FELL DOWN ALL MY HAPPINESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CONTINUAL PURSUIT OF THIS END THE END HAD CEASED TO CHARM AND HOW COULD THERE EVER AGAIN BE ANY INTEREST IN THE MEANS
7148-7763-0010 FOR SOME MONTHS THE CLOUD SEEMED TO GROW THICKER AND THICKER THE LINES IN COLERIDGE'S DEJECTION I WAS NOT THEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM EXACTLY DESCRIBE MY CASE A GRIEF WITHOUT A PANG VOID
7148-7763-0011 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0013 I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
7148-7763-0014 I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0016 HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0017 AND THE MORE I DWELT UPON IT THE MORE HOPELESS IT APPEARED MY COURSE OF STUDY
7148-7763-0019 WITH ALL THINGS BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT WHOLE
7148-7763-0020 ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
7148-7763-0022 I DID NOT DOUBT THAT BY THESE MEANS BEGUN EARLY AND APPLIED UNREMITTINGLY INTENSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ESPECIALLY OF PAIN MIGHT BE CREATED
7148-7763-0023 AND MIGHT PRODUCE DESIRES AND AVERSIONS CAPABLE OF LASTING UNDIMINISHED TO THE END OF LIFE BUT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL AND CASUAL IN ASSOCIATIONS THUS PRODUCED
7148-7763-0025 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026 THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0028 ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029 TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0031 OF THE ENTIRE INSUFFICIENCY OF WHICH TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE NO ONE HAD A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN I HAD THESE WERE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE BY WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO ME
7148-7763-0032 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-7763-0034 THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
7148-7763-0035 AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
7148-59157-0001 WE ARE STILL LEFT IN THE DARK IT IS TRUE AS TO KEATS'S RACE AND DESCENT WHETHER KEATS'S FATHER CAME TO LONDON FROM CORNWALL OR NOT SIR SIDNEY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE ON
7148-59157-0002 THE RATHER SHAKY EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD IF IT SHOULD HEREAFTER TURN OUT THAT KEATS WAS A CORNISHMAN AT ONE REMOVE MATTHEW ARNOLD'S CONJECTURE AS TO THE CELTIC ELEMENT IN HIM
7148-59157-0004 THAT KEATS WAS PREMATURELY BORN AT THE END OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
7148-59157-0005 HE WAS SCARCELY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE HE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN WHEN HIS MOTHER WHO HAD RE MARRIED UNHAPPILY AND THEN BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND DIED A VICTIM OF CHRONIC RHEUMATISM AND CONSUMPTION
7148-59157-0007 SHE WAS A PERSON OF UNBRIDLED TEMPERAMENT AND THAT IN HER LATER YEARS SHE FELL INTO LOOSE WAYS AND WAS NO CREDIT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE HAD OTHER QUALITIES BESIDES THOSE MENTIONED BY THE TEA DEALER IS SHOWN BY THE PASSIONATE AFFECTION
7148-59157-0008 THAT EXISTED BETWEEN HER AND HER SON JOHN ONCE AS A YOUNG CHILD WHEN SHE WAS ORDERED TO BE KEPT QUIET DURING AN ILLNESS HE IS SAID TO HAVE INSISTED ON KEEPING WATCH AT HER DOOR WITH AN OLD SWORD AND ALLOWING NO ONE TO GO IN
7148-59157-0010 THEIR GRANDFATHER THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0011 TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0013 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON INDEED IN ALL THE KEATS CIRCLE TO WHOM ONE IS MORE PASSIONATELY GRATEFUL THAN TO COWDEN CLARKE THAT IS FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0014 WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
7148-59157-0016 AS THE INTENSIFIER OF KEATS'S GENIUS THE MINX AS KEATS IRRITABLY CALLED HER WHO TRANSFORMED HIM IN A FEW MONTHS FROM A POET OF STILL DOUBTFUL FAME INTO A MASTER AND AN IMMORTAL THE ATTACHMENT
7148-59157-0017 SIR SIDNEY THINKS WAS A MISFORTUNE FOR HIM THOUGH HE QUALIFIES THIS BY ADDING THAT SO PROBABLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST ANY PASSION FOR A WOMAN HAVE BEEN WELL LET US TEST THIS MISFORTUNE BY ITS CONSEQUENCES
7148-59157-0019 AND WROTE THE ODE TO AUTUMN
7148-59157-0020 IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0022 DOES HIS BEST TO BE FAIR TO FANNY
7148-59157-0023 AS WELL AS ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO TRANSMUTE IT INTO PERFECT LITERATURE HE SEEMS TO HAVE ADMIRED WOMEN VULGARLY AS CREATURES WHOSE HANDS WERE WAITING TO BE SQUEEZED RATHER THAN AS EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS
7148-59157-0025 WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0026 SIR SIDNEY COLVIN REGRETS THAT THE LOVE LETTERS OF KEATS TO FANNY WERE EVER PUBLISHED IT WOULD BE AS REASONABLE IN MY OPINION
7148-59157-0028 I ETERNALLY SEE HER FIGURE ETERNALLY VANISHING AND WHEN HE REACHES NAPLES HE WRITES TO THE SAME FRIEND I CAN BEAR TO DIE I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HER O GOD
7148-59157-0029 MY IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLY VIVID ABOUT HER I SEE HER I HEAR HER O THAT I COULD BE BURIED NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES I AM AFRAID TO WRITE TO HER
7148-59157-0031 SANS MERCI SIR SIDNEY IS ALL IN FAVOUR AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR HIS PREFERENCE OF THE EARLIER VERSION WHICH BEGINS O WHAT CAN AIL THEE KNIGHT AT ARMS ALONE AND PALELY LOITERING
7148-59157-0032 BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
7148-59157-0034 EVERY EDITION OF KEATS OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS JUST AS IT OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS OF HYPERION NOTHING THAT I HAVE WRITTEN WILL BE REGARDED I TRUST AS
7148-59157-0035 DEPRECIATING THE ESSENTIAL EXCELLENCE POWER AND IN ITS SCHOLARLY WAY EVEN THE GREATNESS OF SIR SIDNEY COLVIN'S BOOK BUT A CERTAIN FALSE EMPHASIS HERE AND THERE

7178-34644-0001 GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
7178-34644-0003 HE FELT HIMSELF PLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH THE SHERIFF HAD JUST VACATED HE LET IT BE DONE WITHOUT SEEKING AN EXPLANATION WHEN GWYNPLAINE WAS SEATED THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM AND THE WAPENTAKE RETIRED A FEW STEPS

7178-34644-0015 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LORD CLANCHARLIE HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF GWYNPLAINE THIS FACT IS THE RESULT OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SLIGHT POWERS OF MEMORY HE COULD HAVE HAD WHEN HE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED

7178-34644-0042 HARDQUANONNE THEN THE SHERIFF RESUMING THAT MONOTONOUS TONE OF VOICE WHICH RESEMBLES NOTHING ELSE AND WHICH MAY BE TERMED A JUDICIAL ACCENT TURNED TOWARDS THE SUFFERER
7178-34644-0043 HARDQUANONNE WHEN BY US THE SHERIFF THIS BOTTLE ON WHICH IS YOUR NAME WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME SHOWN EXHIBITED AND PRESENTED TO YOU YOU AT ONCE AND WILLINGLY

7178-34644-0052 HARDQUANONNE THANK HER MAJESTY BY A SIGN THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM SET IN MOTION THE MAN DRESSED IN LEATHER THIS MAN WHO WAS THE EXECUTIONER'S ASSISTANT
7178-34644-0054 THEN HE FREED HIS WRISTS AND ANKLE BONES FROM THE FOUR CHAINS THAT FASTENED HIM TO THE PILLARS THE PRISONER RELEASED ALIKE FROM STONES AND CHAINS LAY FLAT ON THE GROUND HIS EYES CLOSED

7178-34644-0067 AND HE BOWED TO HIM THE SERJEANT ON THE RIGHT THE DOCTOR THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM THE WAPENTAKE THE SECRETARY ALL THE ATTENDANTS EXCEPT THE EXECUTIONER
7178-34644-0069 IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS MAN HAD BEEN THERE IN THE SHADOW BEFORE GWYNPLAINE HAD ENTERED THAT HE HAD A REGULAR RIGHT OF ATTENDANCE
7178-34644-0070 THE MAN WAS FAT AND PURSY AND WORE A COURT WIG AND A TRAVELLING CLOAK HE WAS RATHER OLD THAN YOUNG AND VERY PRECISE HE SALUTED GWYNPLAINE WITH EASE AND RESPECT
7178-34644-0072 IT IS TIME TO AWAKE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE GWYNPLAINE YOU ARE CLANCHARLIE YOU BELIEVE YOURSELF TO BE ONE OF THE PEOPLE YOU BELONG TO THE PEERAGE
7178-34644-0073 SAID THE FAT MAN THAT I AM CALLED BARKILPHEDRO THAT I AM AN OFFICER OF THE ADMIRALTY THAT THIS WAIF THE FLASK OF HARDQUANONNE WAS FOUND ON THE BEACH AND WAS BROUGHT TO BE UNSEALED BY ME
7178-34644-0075 A LEGISLATOR AND A JUDGE A SUPREME JUDGE A SOVEREIGN LEGISLATOR DRESSED IN PURPLE AND ERMINE EQUAL TO PRINCES LIKE UNTO EMPERORS THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR BROW THE CORONET OF A PEER
7178-34645-0000 PICKED UP ON THE SAND AT LOW WATER A FLASK COVERED WITH WICKER WHICH HAD BEEN CAST UP BY THE TIDE THIS FLASK COVERED WITH MOULD WAS CORKED BY A TARRED BUNG THE SOLDIER CARRIED THE WAIF TO THE COLONEL OF THE CASTLE
7178-34645-0002 CARRIED IT TO THE QUEEN THE QUEEN IMMEDIATELY TOOK THE MATTER INTO CONSIDERATION TWO WEIGHTY COUNSELLORS WERE INSTRUCTED AND CONSULTED NAMELY THE LORD CHANCELLOR
7178-34645-0003 WE MUST NOT CONFOUND THIS CHANCELLOR WITH HIS NAMESAKE AND CONTEMPORARY WILLIAM COWPER THE ANATOMIST AND COMMENTATOR ON BIDLOO WHO PUBLISHED A TREATISE ON MUSCLES IN ENGLAND
7178-34645-0005 THAT IN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION THE RESTORATION OF A PEER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE RESTORATION OF A KING
7178-34645-0006 THE AUTHOR OF A MAXIM DELIGHTS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO WHICH IT MAY BE APPLIED HERE WAS A CASE OF THE RESTORATION OF A PEER SEARCH WAS MADE GWYNPLAINE BY THE INSCRIPTION OVER HIS DOOR
7178-34645-0008 HARDQUANONNE WAS STILL IN PRISON AT CHATHAM THEY HAD ONLY TO PUT THEIR HANDS ON HIM HE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM CHATHAM TO LONDON IN THE MEANTIME INFORMATION WAS SOUGHT IN SWITZERLAND
7178-34645-0009 THE FACTS WERE FOUND TO BE CORRECT THEY OBTAINED FROM THE LOCAL ARCHIVES AT VEVEY AT LAUSANNE THE CERTIFICATE OF LORD LINNAEUS'S MARRIAGE IN EXILE THE CERTIFICATE OF HIS CHILD'S BIRTH THE CERTIFICATE OF THE DECEASE OF THE FATHER AND MOTHER
7178-34645-0011 TO THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED PATHOLOGICALLY THE CASES OF CAPRICE CALLED OUR GOOD WILL AND PLEASURE
7178-34645-0012 WHOSE CREDIT REQUIRED THE CONCEALMENT OF SUCH ACTS HAVE ALLOWED THAT TO BE WRITTEN WHICH ENDANGERED THEIR SUCCESS THE ANSWER IS CYNICISM HAUGHTY INDIFFERENCE OH
7178-34645-0014 OFTEN WHEN IT WOULD BE TO A MAN'S GREATEST ADVANTAGE TO ESCAPE FROM THE HANDS OF THE POLICE OR THE RECORDS OF HISTORY
7178-34645-0015 LOOK AT MY ARM OBSERVE THE DESIGN I AM LACENAIRE SEE A TEMPLE OF LOVE AND A BURNING HEART PIERCED THROUGH WITH AN ARROW
7178-34645-0017 CHRISTINA SEIZED MONALDESCHI HAD HIM CONFESSED AND ASSASSINATED AND SAID I AM THE QUEEN OF SWEDEN IN THE PALACE OF THE KING OF FRANCE
7178-34645-0018 THERE IS THE TYRANT WHO CONCEALS HIMSELF LIKE TIBERIUS AND THE TYRANT WHO DISPLAYS HIMSELF
7178-34645-0020 HIS CRIMES LAY LIGHT UPON HIS CONSCIENCE HE WAS A MONSTER BY THE GRACE OF GOD THEREFORE HE HAD NOTHING TO DISSIMULATE NOR TO EXTENUATE AND HIS ASSASSINATIONS WERE BY DIVINE RIGHT
7178-34645-0021 HE TOO WOULD NOT HAVE MINDED LEAVING BEHIND HIM THOSE ARCHIVES OF SIMANCAS WITH ALL HIS MISDEEDS DATED CLASSIFIED LABELLED AND PUT IN ORDER EACH IN ITS COMPARTMENT LIKE POISONS IN THE CABINET OF A CHEMIST
7178-34645-0023 JUSSU REGIS QUEEN ANNE IN ONE PARTICULAR UNFEMININE SEEING THAT SHE COULD KEEP A SECRET DEMANDED A CONFIDENTIAL REPORT OF SO GRAVE A MATTER FROM THE LORD CHANCELLOR
7178-34645-0024 ONE OF THE KIND SPECIFIED AS REPORT TO THE ROYAL EAR REPORTS OF THIS KIND HAVE BEEN COMMON IN ALL MONARCHIES AT VIENNA THERE WAS A COUNSELLOR OF THE EAR AN AULIC DIGNITARY
7178-34645-0026 WHOM THE QUEEN BELIEVED IN BECAUSE HE WAS SHORT SIGHTED LIKE HERSELF OR EVEN MORE SO HAD COMMITTED TO WRITING A MEMORANDUM COMMENCING THUS TWO BIRDS WERE SUBJECT TO SOLOMON A LAPWING THE HUDBUD
7178-34645-0027 THE LORD CHANCELLOR PROVED THE FACT THAT THE HEIR TO A PEERAGE HAD BEEN CARRIED OFF MUTILATED AND THEN RESTORED
7178-34645-0029 SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
7178-34645-0030 THE EYES OF DUKES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HAVE BEEN PLUCKED OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE KINGDOM CERTAIN PRINCES TOO NEAR TO THE THRONE HAVE BEEN CONVENIENTLY STIFLED BETWEEN MATTRESSES
7178-34645-0032 IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
7178-34645-0033 THUS SHOULD BE DONE TO GWYNPLAINE WHO IS ALSO A KING SEEING THAT HE IS A PEER
7178-34645-0035 THAT OF APOLLO WHO WAS A GOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERD IN SHORT THE LEARNED CHANCELLOR CONCLUDED BY ADVISING THE REINSTATEMENT IN ALL HIS ESTATES AND DIGNITIES OF LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34645-0036 MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
7178-34645-0038 FOR IF THE PRISONER DIES ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE CONFRONTATION BECOMES DIFFICULT STILL THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED
7190-90542-0000 THE IDENTITY OF THE FINAL VICTIM
7190-90542-0002 BUT SUCH WAS MY CASE AND SINCE ZENA'S MANNER DID NOT SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ME MY LOVE AFFAIR SEEMED RATHER A HOPELESS ONE MY ASSOCIATION WITH CHRISTOPHER QUARLES HAS HOWEVER
7190-90542-0003 LED TO THE SOLUTION OF SOME STRANGE MYSTERIES AND SINCE MY OWN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN I MAY CONFINE MYSELF TO THOSE CASES WHICH SINGLE HANDED I SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO SOLVE I KNOW THAT IN MANY OF THEM I WAS CREDITED WITH HAVING UNRAVELED THE MYSTERY
7190-90542-0005 HE WAS OFTEN AS ASTONISHED AT MY ACUMEN IN FOLLOWING A CLEW AS I WAS AT HIS MARVELOUS THEORIES
7190-90542-0006 PERHAPS HIS CURIOUS POWER WAS NEVER MORE NOTICEABLE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE WITHAN MURDER A FARMER RETURNING FROM MEDWORTH THE NEIGHBORING MARKET TOWN ONE NIGHT IN JANUARY
7190-90542-0008 IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME DAYS LATER THAT THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND IN THE INTERVAL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN IDLE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE MAN WAS POORLY DRESSED THAT HIS HANDS PROVED HE WAS USED TO MANUAL LABOR BUT THERE WAS NO MARK EITHER ON HIS BODY OR ON HIS CLOTHING
7190-90542-0009 NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
7190-90542-0011 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0012 AND WOULD BE FOUND BURIED IN THE WOOD IT WAS NOT FOUND HOWEVER AND THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON PANIC FOR A FEW DAYS THE WITHAN MURDER SEEMED UNIQUE IN ATROCITIES AND THEN CAME A COMMUNICATION FROM THE FRENCH POLICE
7190-90542-0014 AND THE MURDER HAD REMAINED A MYSTERY THESE WERE THE POINTS KNOWN AND CONJECTURED WHEN THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND MY INVESTIGATIONS ADDED LITTLE TO THEM ONE POINT HOWEVER IMPRESSED ME I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE SHOWN TO ME HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN ENGLAND
7190-90542-0015 THEY WERE POOR WORN ALMOST THREADBARE BUT THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AND THE CUT WAS NOT ENGLISH THAT IT WAS FRENCH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFIRM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND SO I FASHIONED A FRAGILE LINK WITH THE NORMANDY CRIME
7190-90542-0017 WHENEVER HE WAS INTERESTED IN A CASE I WAS ALWAYS TAKEN INTO HIS EMPTY ROOM AT OTHER TIMES WE WERE IN THE DINING ROOM OR THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS THE EMPTY ROOM ON THIS OCCASION AND ZENA REMAINED WITH US
7190-90542-0018 THE FOREIGN CUT OF THE CLOTHES MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE HE SAID I AM NOT SURE IS THIS WOOD YOU MENTION OF ANY GREAT EXTENT NO IT RUNS BESIDE THE ROAD FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD WITHAN NO IT WAS NEAR THE WITHAN END OF IT THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0020 WHICH IS CONTINUED AS A DIVISION BETWEEN TWO FIELDS WHICH FORM PART OF THE FARM LAND BEHIND THE WOOD BY WALKING ALONG THIS THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE WOOD WITHOUT LEAVING TRACKS BEHIND HIM A GOOD POINT WIGAN AND WHERE WOULD THAT DITCH LEAD HIM EVENTUALLY TO THE HIGH ROAD
7190-90542-0021 WHICH RUNS ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WITHAN ROAD MUCH WATER IN THE DITCH ASKED QUARLES HALF A FOOT WHEN I WENT THERE
7190-90542-0023 AND AFTER GOING TO THE VILLAGE THE FARMER RETURNED TO MEDWORTH FOR THE POLICE
7190-90542-0024 SAID ZENA AND IF HE WERE MET ON THE ROAD CARRYING A BAG HE WOULD ARREST ATTENTION WHY CARRYING A BAG ASKED QUARLES WITH THE HEAD IN IT SHE ANSWERED THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT WIGAN CHUCKLED QUARLES OF COURSE
7190-90542-0026 ONE OR TWO DOUBTFUL PLACES I HAD DUG UP I THINK THE MURDERER MUST HAVE TAKEN THE HEAD WITH HIM TO BURY SOMEWHERE ELSE ASKED QUARLES
7190-90542-0027 A MAD DOCTOR BENT ON BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IS THAT YOUR THEORY WIGAN
7190-90542-0029 AT THAT DATE SAID QUARLES YOU HAVE A THEORY PROFESSOR AN OUTLANDISH ONE WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO NO I DO NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT I NEVER MENTION MY THEORIES UNTIL I HAVE SOME FACTS TO SUPPORT THEM
7190-90542-0030 I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO MAKE INQUIRY WHETHER ANY SIMILAR CRIME HAD HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE JANUARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AND HAD THE SAME INQUIRY MADE IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY MURDER BEARING THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE WITHAN TRAGEDY
7190-90542-0032 WE TOOK ROOMS AT A HOTEL IN MEDWORTH QUARLES EXPLAINING THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE SOME DAYS NEXT MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING TO WITHAN AS I HAD EXPECTED HE TOOK ME TO THE POLICE COURT
7190-90542-0033 THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
7190-90542-0035 SAID QUARLES MIND YOU WIGAN I'M VERY DOUBTFUL ABOUT MY THEORY AT LEAST I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT I SHALL FIND THE FACTS I WANT A FEW HOURS WILL SETTLE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AFTER WALKING ALONG THE ROAD FOR ABOUT A MILE
7190-90542-0036 QUARLES SCRAMBLED THROUGH A HEDGE INTO A WOOD BY THE ROADSIDE
7190-90542-0038 DO YOU GO ARMED ALWAYS I ANSWERED I DO SOMETIMES HE SAID TAPPING HIS POCKET WE MIGHT COME UP AGAINST DANGER IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT IF I TELL YOU TO SHOOT SHOOT AND QUICKLY
7190-90542-0039 YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
7190-90542-0041 TO OUR RIGHT WAS A LARGE HOUSE ONLY PARTIALLY SEEN THROUGH ITS SCREEN OF TREES BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY MELLOW WITH AGE TO OUR LEFT TOWARD WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXTREMITY OF THE PARK WAS HILLY GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN WILD
7190-90542-0042 TO THIS QUARLES POINTED THAT IS OUR WAY HE SAID WE'LL USE WHAT COVER WE CAN WE PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD AGAIN AND WERE SOON IN THE WILDERNESS FORCING OUR WAY SOMETIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH
7190-90542-0044 GRUNTING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT EACH TIME HE FAILED TO FIND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR I SAID I WASN'T CERTAIN HE WHISPERED WHEN OUR PATH HAD LED US INTO A DAMP HOLLOW WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY MAN FOR CENTURIES MY THEORY SEEMS
7190-90542-0045 AND YET THIS IS SUCH A LIKELY PLACE THERE MUST BE A WAY HE WAS GOING FORWARD AGAIN THE HOLLOW WAS SURROUNDED BY PERPENDICULAR WALLS OF SAND AND CHALK IT WAS A PIT IN FACT WHICH NATURE HAD FILLED WITH VEGETATION THE WAY WE HAD COME SEEMED THE ONLY WAY INTO IT
7190-90542-0047 SAID QUARLES LET'S GET ON THE ROOF I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS SO HELP ME UP IT WAS NOT MUCH HELP HE WANTED IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE ON THE ROOF AS I THOUGHT HE SAID
7190-90542-0048 WE'LL GO CAREFULLY SAID QUARLES THERE MAY BE WORSE THAN POACHERS TRAPS HERE WITHOUT HELP FROM ME HE DROPPED FROM THE ROOF AND I FOLLOWED HIM THE NATURAL PASSAGE WAS WINDING AND ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG AND OPENED INTO ANOTHER PIT OF SOME SIZE
7190-90542-0050 THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
7190-90542-0051 I THINK WE ARE ALONE HERE BUT KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN THE SHED WAS EVIDENTLY USED SOMETIMES THERE WAS A STONE SLAB WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FIREPLACE AND FROM A BEAM ABOVE HUNG A SHORT CHAIN ON WHICH A POT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WE'LL GET AWAY QUICKLY SAID QUARLES
7190-90542-0053 I DARESAY ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE OVER THE HOUSE
7190-90542-0054 HE WAS ALWAYS AS SECRET AS THE GRAVE UNTIL HE HAD PROVED HIS THEORY AND THEN HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO FORGET THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND SHRANK FROM PUBLICITY
7190-90542-0056 I THINK WE ARE FIRST BUT GREAT CARE IS NECESSARY HE WHISPERED WE CREPT FORWARD AND CONCEALED OURSELVES AMONG THE SCRUB VEGETATION WHICH GREW IN THAT PART OF THE PIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE SKY IT WAS DARK THE LONG SHED BARELY DISCERNIBLE
7190-90542-0057 BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS PARTICULAR ABOUT OUR POSITION WE MAY HAVE TO CREEP A LITTLE NEARER PRESENTLY HE WHISPERED FROM HERE WE CAN DO SO SILENCE WIGAN AND DON'T BE ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING THE WAITING SEEMED LONG MOONLIGHT WAS PRESENTLY ABOVE US
7190-90542-0059 I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE RAISED FLOOR OF THE SHED A MAN'S STEP AND ONLY ONE MAN'S I HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME I THINK HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER ONCE AND WENT UP AGAIN
7190-90542-0060 THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
7190-90542-0062 WHEN HE GOT DOWN AGAIN I SAW THAT A BUNDLE WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE FIRE
7190-90542-0063 ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
7190-90542-0065 WERE FIVE OR SIX HUMAN HEADS BLACKENED SHRIVELED FACES WHICH SEEMED TO GRIN HORRIBLY AS THEY SWUNG DEEPLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIT UP BY THE FLICKER OF THE FLAMES DO YOU SEE WIGAN QUARLES ASKED AGAIN YES
7190-90542-0066 AND THE MAN WHO IS HE ON THE BENCH YESTERDAY SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM
7190-90542-0068 AND I WAITED EXPECTING SOME FURTHER REVELATION LISTENING FOR OTHER FOOTSTEPS NONE CAME THE FIRE FLICKERED LOWER AND WENT OUT THE MOON HAD SET AND THE COLD OF THE EARLY MORNING GOT INTO MY BONES
7190-90542-0069 IN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THE MAN MOVED ABOUT THE SHED AGAIN AND PRESENTLY I HEARD HIM GO PATIENCE WHISPERED QUARLES AS I STARTED UP TO GO AFTER HIM HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY
7190-90542-0071 THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
7190-90542-0072 WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
7190-90542-0074 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90542-0075 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
7190-90542-0077 HE WAS SANE ENOUGH TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HE WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THIS TIME OF THE YEAR CAME ROUND AT THE FULL MOON HE IS ALWAYS QUEER WITNESS LAST NIGHT BUT HE IS ONLY DANGEROUS IN JANUARY DANGEROUS I MEAN WITHOUT PROVOCATION
7190-90542-0078 TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
7190-90542-0080 SIR HENRY WAITING IN THE WOOD PERHAPS FOR HOURS MAY HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS TO PASS BEFORE THIS MAN CAME HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND ATTACKED HIM BUT THE HEAD
7190-90542-0081 WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
7190-90542-0083 THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
7190-90543-0000 HOWEVER OBSCURE A MYSTERY MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME POINT OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF RIGHTLY INTERPRETED WILL LEAD TO ITS SOLUTION EVEN IN THOSE CRIMES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED THIS POINT EXISTS ONLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN DULY APPRECIATED
7190-90543-0002 AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WHICH CAUSED SUCH SPECULATION FOR A TIME WAS NOT THE LEAST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD THE EMINENT PHYSICIAN OF HARLEY STREET HAD GIVEN A SMALL DINNER PARTY ONE EVENING THE GUESTS LEFT EARLY
7190-90543-0003 AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
7190-90543-0005 THERE WERE SEVERAL SILVER ARTICLES ON THE SIDEBOARD BUT THESE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED THE BURGLARS APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION TO SIR JOSEPH'S ROOM WHICH WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION TWO CUPBOARDS AND EVERY DRAWER HAD BEEN TURNED OUT AND THE CONTENTS THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7190-90543-0006 BUT OF AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE PRESENTING LITTLE DIFFICULTY TO EXPERTS IN IT BESIDES PAPERS AND ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS IN GOLD IN A CANVAS BAG
7190-90543-0008 IT LOOKED AS IF THE BOX HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND TRODDEN ON BY MISTAKE FOR THE COUNTERS WERE IN A LITTLE HEAP CLOSE TO THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS IT APPEARED THAT THE BURGLARS MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND HAD MADE OFF WITHOUT SECURING THEIR BOOTY
7190-90543-0009 THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
7190-90543-0011 HAD NEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ANY MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY
7190-90543-0012 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
7190-90543-0014 AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7190-90543-0015 MOREOVER THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND THE DIRTY GLASSES SUGGESTED A CERTAIN LEISURELY METHOD OF GOING TO WORK AND MEN OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE EASILY FRIGHTENED THE CIGARETTE ENDS PUZZLED ME THEY WERE OF A CHEAP AMERICAN BRAND
7190-90543-0017 IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
7190-90543-0018 AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID HAD BEEN EMPTIED OUT OF THIS INTO THE OTHER TWO ON INQUIRY ONE OF THE SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT ONLY A VERY LITTLE OF THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TAKEN SHE ALSO SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE BISCUIT LEFT IN THE BOX LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THERE NOW
7190-90543-0020 HE SAID I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE BURGLAR BUT FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE BELIEVED THERE WERE MORE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A REASONABLE CONCLUSION I FANCY SAID QUARLES IF YOU ARE RIGHT IT NARROWS THE SPHERE OF INQUIRY
7190-90543-0021 NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
7190-90543-0023 AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
7190-90543-0024 WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR
7190-90543-0026 I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
7190-90543-0027 SIR JOSEPH'S STANDING IS VERY HIGH SUDDEN TEMPTATION OR NECESSITY MAY SUBVERT THE HIGHEST CHARACTER I ANSWERED
7190-90543-0029 NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY DIRECT QUESTION OF MINE SHOWING THAT THE IDEAS WERE IN HIS MIND WHY THE EXPLANATION WOULD BE SIMPLE IF HE WERE THE BURGLAR OF HIS OWN PAPERS
7190-90543-0030 I ADMIT THE ARGUMENT IS SOUND WIGAN BUT IT DOES NOT CREEP INTO MY BRAIN WITH ANY COMPELLING INFLUENCE THERE IS A LINK MISSING IN THE CHAIN SOMEWHERE AND HE LOOKED AT ZENA HIS OFTEN REPEATED STATEMENT THAT SHE HELPED HIM BY HER QUESTIONS HAD NEVER IMPRESSED ME VERY GREATLY
7190-90543-0032 IT WAS SO NOW YOU DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN THE BROKEN BOX OF COUNTERS SHE SAID TURNING TOWARD HER GRANDFATHER I WONDER WIGAN IS THAT THE CLEW QUARLES SAID QUICKLY IT CREEPS INTO MY BRAIN THE COUNTERS WERE IN A HEAP I SAID
7190-90543-0033 ASKED QUARLES NO THAT WOULD HAVE SCATTERED THEM MORE THEY WERE ROUND AND MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OVER AFTER HAVING BEEN PUT ONE UPON ANOTHER AS ONE GATHERS COPPERS TOGETHER WHEN COUNTING A NUMBER OF THEM SIR JOSEPH PICKED THEM UP
7190-90543-0035 THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT WIGAN BUT I CANNOT SEE YET IN WHICH DIRECTION THEY LEAD US WE MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE I HAD BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO QUARLES JUMPING TO SOME SUDDEN CONCLUSION THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED
7190-90543-0036 NATURALLY I WAS NOT IDLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT AT THE END OF THEM I HAD LEARNT NOTHING THEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS TWO DOCTORS HOUSES WERE BURGLED THE FIRST WAS IN KENSINGTON
7190-90543-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
7190-90543-0039 ONLY SERVANTS BEING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK SUFFERING FROM FACEACHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS ALL NIGHT BUT HAD HEARD NOTHING
7190-90543-0041 THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED I SAID NO NO THE EXPECTED
7190-90543-0042 I'VE READ EVERY REPORT BUT TELL ME YOURSELF EVERY DETAIL I DID SO THE SAME BRAND OF CIGARETTES HE ASKED NO BUT ALL CHEAP AMERICAN ONES
7190-90543-0044 NO I HOLD TO THE ONE MAN THEORY AND YOU ARE RIGHT HE SNAPPED I ADMIT I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT UPON THE RIGHT TRACK HAD YOU NOT MADE THAT DISCOVERY IT WAS CLEVER WIGAN IT DID NOT SEEM TO HELP YOU TO A THEORY I ANSWERED TRUE
7190-90543-0045 MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ANSWER IF HE HAD
7226-86964-0000 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
7226-86964-0001 IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
7226-86964-0003 AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
7226-86964-0004 IN THE BOTTOMS THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF BIRDS CROWS HAWKS BLACKBIRDS WITH STATELY BLUE HERONS AND AGILE PLOVERS FORAGING ON THE LONG GRAVEL SPITS WHICH FREQUENTLY JUT FAR INTO THE STREAM
7226-86964-0006 WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0009 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0015 THE SNAGS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AS THE LEGACY OF LAST SPRING'S FLOOD AND THE FREQUENT SAND BANKS AND GRAVEL SPITS NAVIGATION WAS ATTENDED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES AND SOME DANGERS FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW PROPHETSTOWN
7226-86964-0016 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0018 BUT WHERE OUR INFORMANT HAD GONE THROUGH WITH HIS UNWIELDY HULK WE CONSIDERED IT SAFE TO VENTURE WITH A CANOE SO READILY RESPONSIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST PADDLE STROKE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0021 JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7226-86964-0022 THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
7226-86964-0024 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0027 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0030 WHICH HE CONSIDERED A GOODLY SUM AND HIS FATHER IN LAW HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE AN ESTABLISHED PLANT FOR HIM BUT THE YOUNG FELLOW SAID THAT FERRYING WAS A DOG'S LIFE AND KEPT A FELLER HOME LIKE BARN CHORES
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0033 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0036 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0037 WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
7226-86964-0039 ENDED IN OUR BEING DIRECTED TO A SMALL FARM HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE INLAND WHERE LUCKLESS TRAVELERS BELATED ON THE DREARY BOTTOMS WERE OCCASIONALLY KEPT MAKING THE CANOE FAST FOR THE NIGHT WE STRUNG OUR BAGGAGE PACKS UPON THE PADDLE WHICH WE CARRIED BETWEEN US
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0042 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS
7226-86964-0043 AS HER HANDS FOLDED WITHIN HER UP TURNED APRON SHE COURTESIED TO W WE WERE AT ONCE SHOWN INTO A FROWSY APARTMENT WHICH SERVED AS PARLOR SITTING ROOM AND PARENTAL DORMITORY
7226-86964-0045 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0046 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR ON AN EVENING VISIT DECKED OUT IN A SMART JOCKEY CAP WITH A GREEN OSTRICH TIP AND BRIGHT BLUE RIBBONS AND GAY IN A NEW CALICO DRESS
7226-86964-0048 COMING IN LIKE MOURNFUL EJACULATIONS FROM THE AMEN CORNER AT A SUCCESSFUL REVIVAL HAVING EXHAUSTED HER STOCK OF TUNES SHE WHEELED AROUND UPON HER STOOL AND AFTER DECLARING TO HER HALF DOZEN ADMIRING AUDITORS THAT HER HANDS
7226-86964-0049 WERE AS TIRED AS AFTER THE MORNIN'S MILKIN ABRUPTLY ACCOSTED W MA'AM KIN YE PLAY ON THE ORGIN W CONFESSED HER INABILITY CHIEFLY FROM LACK OF PRACTICE IN THE ART OF INCESSANTLY WORKING THE PEDALS
7226-86964-0051 W MODESTLY CONFESSED TO NEVER HAVING POSSESSED SUCH AN INSTRUMENT DOWN IN THESE PARTS REJOINED THE YOUNG WOMAN AS SHE WORKED THE BELLERS INTO A STRAIN OR TWO OF HOLD THE FORT APPARENTLY TO SHOW HOW EASY IT CAME TO TRAINED FEET
7226-86964-0052 NO HOUSE IS NOW CONSIDERED QUITE UP TO THE FASHI'N AS AIN'T GOT A ORGIN THE RAIN BEING NOW OVER SHE SOON DEPARTED
7226-86964-0054 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP
7226-86964-0055 WITH THE ODDEST COLLECTION OF CALICO AND GINGHAM GOWNS BUSTLES HOOPSKIRTS HATS BONNETS AND WINTER UNDERWEAR I THINK I HAD EVER LAID EYES ON MUCH OF THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS WAS NOT KNOWN HOWEVER UNTIL NEXT MORNING
7226-86964-0057 THAN THE CREAKY OLD CLEAT DOOR WAS GENTLY CLOSED UPON US AND BUTTONED BY OUR HOSTESS UPON THE OUTSIDE AS THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING IT SHUT AND WE WERE LEFT FREE TO GROPE ABOUT AMONG THESE MYSTERIES AS BEST WE MIGHT
7226-86964-0058 WE HAD HARDLY RECOVERED FROM OUR ASTONISHMENT AT THUS BEING LOCKED INTO A DARK HOLE THE SIZE OF A FASHIONABLE LADY'S TRUNK AND WERE QUIETLY LAUGHING OVER THIS ODD ADVENTURE WHEN THE LANDLADY APPLIED HER MOUTH TO A CRACK AND SHOUTED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE WAKED THE DEAD HI THERE
7226-86964-0060 REPRESSING OUR MIRTH WE ASSURED OUR GOOD HOSTESS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DUE REGARD FOR OUR PERSONAL SAFETY
7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN
7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0008 AN SO I JINED AN I STUCK HER OUT GEMMEN TILL THE THING WAS DONE THEY AIN'T NO COWARD BOUT ME
7226-86965-0009 NOW HE SAYS HOLD ON A MINUTE YOU DIDN'T HEV SHAKES AFORE THE WAR SAYS HE NOT AS MUCH I SAYS NOT KNOWIN WHAT THE FELLER WAS DRIVIN AT BUT SOME I WAS A KID THEN AND KIDS DON'T SHAKE MUCH SAYS I
7226-86965-0011 AN I DON'T KNOW WHAT MY SHOW IS BUT I OUGHT TO HEV A PENSION AN NO MISTAKE GEMMEN THEY WA'N'T NO FELLERS DID HARDER WORK N ME IN THE WAR EF I DO SAY IT MYSELF W VENTURED TO ASK WHAT BATTLES OUR HOST HAD BEEN IN
7226-86965-0012 WHAT I WANTED WAS TO GIT A BEAD ON OL WADE HIMSELF AN EF I DO SAY IT MYSELF THE OL MAN WOULD A HUNTED HIS HOLE GEMMEN WHEN I GET A SIGHT ON A DUCK GEMMEN THAT DUCK'S MINE AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7264-92310-0000 LET US HALT AT THIS PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THING TO CONSIDER CERTAIN OTHER CHANGES WHICH WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE AND WHY THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ADVERTISEMENT HAD COME TO BE THE STAND BY OF A NEWSPAPER
7264-92310-0001 THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
7264-92310-0003 WHERE A GREAT DAILY PAPER IS CONCERNED HE WAS COMPELLED THEN TO RESPECT HIS ADVERTISERS AS HIS PAYMASTERS TO THAT EXTENT THEREFORE HIS POWER OF GIVING TRUE NEWS AND OF PRINTING SOUND OPINION WAS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH HIS OWN INCLINATIONS SHOULD LEAN TOWARDS SUCH NEWS AND SUCH OPINION
7264-92310-0004 AN INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER OWNER MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISLIKE FOR THE TRADE IN PATENT MEDICINES HE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE SWINDLING OF THE POOR WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THAT TRADE HE MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SUFFERED ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
7264-92310-0006 AND FEAR FRICTION IN THEIR OWN CASE HE WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN HIS INCOME PERSUADE HIS READERS TO BUY POISON AND REMAIN FREE PERSONALLY FROM TOUCHING THE STUFF HE RECOMMENDED FOR PAY
7264-92310-0007 THE PROPRIETOR WAS ALWAYS AT THE CHOICE OF PUBLISHING MATTER WHICH DID NOT AFFECT HIM AND SAVING HIS FORTUNE OR REFUSING IT AND JEOPARDIZING HIS FORTUNE HE CHOSE THE FORMER COURSE IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE WAS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ADVERTISEMENT
7264-92310-0009 COULD NOT BUT REGARD HIS GIVING OF AN ADVERTISEMENT AS SOMETHING OF A FAVOUR THERE IS ALWAYS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL OR IF YOU WILL ARTISTIC ELEMENT IN EXCHANGE IN PURE ECONOMICS EXCHANGE IS EXACTLY BALANCED BY THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE EXCHANGERS
7264-92310-0010 JUST AS IN PURE DYNAMICS YOU HAVE THE PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES IN THE IMMENSE COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD MATERIAL FRICTION AND A MILLION OTHER THINGS AFFECT THE IDEAL PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES AND IN ECONOMICS OTHER CONSCIOUS PASSIONS
7264-92310-0012 HE WOULD NOT ADVERTISE IN PAPERS WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BY THEIR PUBLICATION OF OPINION ULTIMATELY HURT CAPITALISM AS A WHOLE STILL LESS IN THOSE WHOSE OPINIONS MIGHT AFFECT HIS OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE ADVERSELY STUPID LIKE ALL PEOPLE GIVEN UP TO GAIN
7264-92310-0013 HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92310-0015 THE ADVERTISER CAME TO SEE THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY DICTATE POLICY AND OPINION AND THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER MOST POWERFUL AND NOVEL WEAPON IN HIS HAND WHICH WAS THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS
7264-92310-0016 WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
7264-92310-0018 THERE WAS NO ANTAGONISM OF CLASS INTEREST ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND WHAT WAS MORE THEY WERE OF THE SAME KIND AND BREED
7264-92310-0019 WAS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF MAN AS HE WHO BOUGHT A PEERAGE OUT OF A COMBINE IN MUSIC HALLS OR CUT HIS THROAT WHEN HIS BLUFF IN INDIAN SILVER WAS CALLED THE TYPE IS THE COMMON MODERN TYPE PARLIAMENT IS FULL OF IT AND IT RUNS NEWSPAPERS ONLY AS ONE OF ITS ACTIVITIES
7264-92310-0021 OFTEN QUITE CONSCIOUS AND DIRECT OF ADVERTISING POWER OVER THE PRESS AND THIS WAS AS I HAVE SAID NOT ONLY NEGATIVE THAT WAS LONG OBVIOUS BUT AT LAST POSITIVE
7264-92310-0022 BOTH COMBATANTS ARE OF A LOW CUNNING AND UNINTELLIGENT TYPE MINOR FRICTION DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE SOMETIMES THE VICTORY FALLS TO THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR MORE OFTEN TO THE ADVERTISER NEVER TO THE PUBLIC
7264-92310-0024 THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
7264-92310-0025 BUT THE FACT THAT ADVERTISEMENT MAKES A PAPER HAS CREATED A STANDARD OF PRINTING AND PAPER SUCH THAT NO ONE SAVE AT A DISASTROUS LOSS CAN ISSUE REGULARLY TO LARGE NUMBERS NEWS AND OPINION WHICH THE LARGE CAPITALIST ADVERTISERS DISAPPROVE
7264-92310-0027 THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92310-0028 IT IS THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNER AS THE TRUE GOVERNING POWER IN THE POLITICAL MACHINERY OF THE STATE SUPERIOR TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE NOMINATING MINISTERS AND DISMISSING THEM IMPOSING POLICIES AND IN GENERAL USURPING SOVEREIGNTY
7264-92310-0030 IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
7264-92310-0031 NO POLICY IS ATTEMPTED UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED THAT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER IS IN FAVOUR OF IT FEW ARE PROFFERED WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING HIS WISHES MANY ARE DIRECTLY ORDERED BY HIM WE ARE IF WE TALK IN TERMS OF REAL THINGS AS MEN DO IN THEIR PRIVATE COUNCILS AT WESTMINSTER
7264-92314-0000 I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0001 THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
7264-92314-0003 LEAST OF ALL IN ENGLAND WHAT HAS GROWN UP HERE IS A PRESS ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT AND FAVOUR TO THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICS WHICH COLOURS THE WHOLE OF OUR GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS TO DAY IN ENGLAND THIS GIVES THEM SO DISTINCT A CHARACTER OF PARLIAMENTARY FALSEHOOD
7264-92314-0004 AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0006 WHICH CONTINENTAL NATIONS KNEW IN THE PAST BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CONTINENTAL EXPERIMENTS NEVER CONSISTED IN MORE THAN A FEW CHOSEN ORGANS
7264-92314-0007 THE CHARACTER OF WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AND THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE REST BUT OUR OFFICIAL PRESS FOR IT IS NO LESS COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD IT HAS IN THE REGION OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPERS NO COMPETITOR INDEED IT HAS NO COMPETITORS AT ALL
7264-92314-0009 COULD BE BETTER SERVED EVEN UNDER A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT CENSORSHIP THAN IT IS IN THE GREAT DAILIES OF LONDON AND THE PRINCIPAL PROVINCIAL CAPITALS IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH THE REGIME DESIRES TO BE SUPPRESSED SUPPRESSED IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH IT DESIRES SUGGESTED SUGGESTED
7264-92314-0010 AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC QUESTION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE REGIME AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS EVER ALLOWED TO APPEAR IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST JOURNALS THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A CASE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS
7264-92314-0012 ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013 IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0015 I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0016 THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
7264-92314-0018 THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0019 THEY HAVE NOT ADVANCED NEARLY AS FAR AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNERS AND THEIR SYSTEM THEY ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART DUPED
7264-92314-0021 AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
7264-92314-0022 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0024 NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0025 NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
7264-92314-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028 I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0030 THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92316-0001 MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
7264-92316-0002 AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT GREAT BODIES OF MEN WHO CARED INTENSELY FOR A DEFINITE CREED FOUND THAT EXPRESSION FOR IT WAS LACKING
7264-92316-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
7264-92316-0005 BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
7264-92316-0007 A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
7264-92316-0008 THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
7264-92316-0010 AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0011 RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
7264-92316-0013 THESE FOUNDERS OF THE FREE PRESS SEEMED TO SAY WE MAY CONVERT THE MASS TO OUR VIEWS BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE ADMITTEDLY A CLIQUE AN EXCEPTIONAL BODY WITH THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO SUCH
7264-92316-0014 THEY SAID THIS ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE LIFE OF FRANCE IS AT LEAST AS CATHOLIC AS THE LIFE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS PLUTOCRATIC OR THE LIFE OF SWITZERLAND DEMOCRATIC AND THEY SAID IT BECAUSE THEY AROSE AFTER THE CAPITALIST PRESS NEUTRAL IN RELIGION AS IN EVERY VITAL THING
7264-92316-0016 FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS
7264-92316-0017 TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
7264-92316-0019 FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
7264-92316-0020 THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
7264-92316-0022 IF ONE PASSES IN REVIEW ALL THE FREE PRESS JOURNALS WHICH OWED THEIR EXISTENCE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE ALONE TO THIS MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA ONE FINDS MANY SIDE SHOWS AS IT WERE BESIDE THE MAIN MOTIVES OF LOCAL OR RACE PATRIOTISM RELIGION OR SOCIALIST CONVICTION
7264-92316-0023 YOU HAVE THE SINGLE TAX PAPERS YOU HAVE THE TEETOTAL PAPERS AND REALLY IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ALSO HAD THE ICONOCLASTS AND THE DIABOLISTS PRODUCING PAPERS THE RATIONALIST AND THE ATHEIST PROPAGANDA I RECKON AMONG THE RELIGIOUS
7264-92316-0025 I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
7264-92316-0026 BUT I KNOW THAT WHEREVER I GET HOLD OF SUCH AN ORGAN IT WILL BE VERY STRONGLY COLOURED WITH THE OPINION OR EVEN FANATICISM OF SOME MINORITY THE FREE PRESS AS A WHOLE
7264-92316-0028 NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0029 BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0031 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0032 BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
7264-92316-0034 BUT NOT A CABINET MINISTER THAT COULD NOT PASS AN EXAMINATION IN THE LIFE VICES VULNERABILITY FORTUNE INVESTMENTS AND FAVOURS OF THE OWNER THE CHANGE WAS RAPIDLY ADMITTED IT CAME QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY AT LAST LIKE MOST RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IT EXCEEDED ITSELF
7264-92316-0035 MEN OWNING THE CHIEF NEWSPAPERS COULD BE HEARD BOASTING OF THEIR POWER IN PUBLIC AS AN ADMITTED THING AND AS THIS POWER WAS RECOGNIZED AND AS IT GREW WITH TIME AND EXPERIMENT IT BRED A REACTION
7264-92316-0037 TO LIE THE SHEER NECESSITY OF GETTING CERTAIN TRUTHS TOLD WHICH THESE POWERFUL BUT HIDDEN FELLOWS REFUSED TO TELL WAS A FORCE WORKING AT HIGH POTENTIAL AND ALMOST COMPELLING THE PRODUCTION OF FREE PAPERS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BIG OFFICIAL ONES
7264-92316-0038 THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
7264-92316-0040 BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT SIMILAR POWER SHOULD RESIDE IN THE HANDS OF OBSCURE NOBODIES ABOUT WHOM NO ILLUSION COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WHOSE TYRANNY IS NOT ADMITTED OR PUBLIC AT ALL WHO DO NOT EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEIR FEATURES AND TO WHOM NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER ATTACHES
7264-92316-0041 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS SO PROVIDED THE THIRD AND PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS
7264-92316-0043 THEY HAD A GENERAL CONCEPTION THAT THE OWNER OF A WIDELY CIRCULATED POPULAR NEWSPAPER COULD AND DID BLACKMAIL THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN MAKE OR UNMAKE THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN BY GRANTING OR REFUSING HIM THE LIMELIGHT
7264-92316-0044 DISPOSE OF CABINETS NOMINATE ABSURD MINISTERS BUT THE PARTICULAR VIVID CONCRETE INSTANCES THAT SPECIALLY MOVE MEN TO ACTION WERE HIDDEN FROM THEM ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH PARTICULAR TRUTHS
7278-91083-0000 LET US ENTER THE ELEGANT BUILDING OCCUPIED BY HIS NEWSPAPER EVERY PORTION IS INTERESTING THE ROOMS WHERE EDITORS AND ASSISTANTS WORK ARE LARGE LIGHT AND AIRY AND AS TASTEFUL AS PARLORS ALAS HOW UNHOMELIKE AND BARREN

7278-91083-0016 HIS HABITS WERE THE BEST AND WHY SHOULD NOT SUCH A BOY SUCCEED IN THREE YEARS WHEN HE WAS TWENTY ONE HE HAD BECOME THE HEAD OF A PUBLISHING HOUSE
7278-91083-0018 AS A PUBLISHER BUT THE PRIZE THAT HE HAD SET OUT TO WIN WAS TO OWN THE PUBLIC LEDGER THE OPPORTUNITY CAME IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR BUT HIS PAPER WAS LOSING MONEY HIS FRIENDS ADVISED AGAINST TAKING SUCH A BURDEN HE WOULD SURELY FAIL

7278-104730-0028 THE EXTREMISTS WHO HAD CAST ASIDE ALL REGARD FOR WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE AND WHO UTTERLY SCORNED TO CONSIDER THE FEASIBILITY OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF MEASURES

7278-104730-0031 AND SO FAR THAT SCARCELY A SLAVE HOLDING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DARES TO VOTE WITH ME UPON ANY QUESTION I HAVE AS YET BEEN THOROUGHLY SUSTAINED BY MY OWN STATE BUT ONE STEP FURTHER AND I HAZARD MY OWN STANDING AND INFLUENCE THERE
7278-104730-0033 WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD IN THE WORLD AND IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTEST WHICH WILL RAGE WITH INCREASING FURY AS IT DRAWS TO ITS CRISIS BUT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF WHICH MY AGE INFIRMITIES AND APPROACHING END
7278-104730-0034 TOTALLY DISQUALIFY ME THERE IS NO SUCH MAN IN THE HOUSE SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HE SAYS I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME OCCUPIED DAY AND NIGHT
7278-104730-0036 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN STILL AT THIS SAME WORK HE MADE A HARD BUT FRUITLESS EFFORT

7278-104730-0042 AND PRESENTED ANOTHER PETITION HE DID NOT DARE TELL ME
7278-246956-0000 AFTER THE SERMON AS THE SERMON DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE MIST OF HIS EMOTION BEGAN TO DISPERSE INDIVIDUAL FACES OF HIS AUDIENCE AGAIN DAWNED OUT ON THE PREACHER'S KEN
7278-246956-0002 REGARDED FROM THE IDEAL POINT OF THE DIVINE IN
7278-246956-0003 OF THE ADVANTAGES HE TOOK FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD KNOWN THEM SUCH AS SHRUNK FROM THE LIGHT NOT COMING
7278-246956-0005 FROM THEM BY THE INDWELLING PRESENCE OF THE GOD OF ALL LIVING MEN AND TRUE MERCHANTS WAS A BLESSEDNESS UNSPEAKABLE SMALL WAS THE SUSPICION IN THE ABBEY CHURCH OF OLASTON THAT MORNING
7278-246956-0006 BATTERY OF SIN SPRUNG SUFFERING WITHSTANDING AND ENDURING AND STILLING THE RECOIL OF THE AWFUL FORCE WHEREWITH HIS FATHER HAD LAUNCHED THE WORLDS AND GIVEN BIRTH TO HUMAN SOULS
7278-246956-0008 THAN ALL THE REST LEOPOLD WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM AND WHILE HE STROVE TO AVOID ABSORPTION IN A PERSONAL INTEREST HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE IT WAS OF NECESSITY
7278-246956-0009 OF HIS UTTERANCE AT TIMES INDEED HE FELT AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TO HIM ONLY AT OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEN HE SAW HER NO MORE THAN HIM
7278-246956-0011 AND THE FIRM MOUTH HAD FORGOTTEN ITSELF INTO A TREMULOUS FORM WHICH THE STILLNESS OF ABSORPTION HAD THERE FOR THE MOMENT FIXED BUT EVEN ALREADY ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT YET READ IT UPON HER
7278-246956-0012 COUNTENANCE A SNAKE HAD BEGUN TO LIFT ITS HEAD FROM THE CHAOTIC SWAMP WHICH RUNS A CREEK AT LEAST INTO EVERY SOUL THE RUDIMENTARY DESOLATION A REMNANT OF THE TIME
7278-246956-0014 WELL BECOMING A PRIEST OF THE GENTLE JESUS OR IF HE FANCIED HE MUST SPEAK OF CONFESSION WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK OF IT IN PLAIN HONEST TERMS INSTEAD OF SUGGESTING THE IDEA OF IT SO THAT THE POOR BOY
7278-246956-0015 IMAGINED IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SPIRIT AND MUST THEREFORE BE OBEYED AS THE WILL OF GOD SO SAID THE SNAKE AND BY THE TIME HELEN HAD WALKED HOME WITH HER AUNT THE GLOW HAD SUNK FROM HER SOUL AND
7278-246956-0017 SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN AND AS LEOPOLD HAD CHOSEN OTHER COUNSELLORS HAD THUS DECLARED HER UNWORTHY OF CONFIDENCE AND AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND DONE FOR LOVE OF HIM
7278-246956-0018 HAD SHE NOT DONE ENOUGH WOULD EVEN HER FATHER REQUIRE MORE OF HER THAN SHE HAD ALREADY DONE AND ENDURED
7278-246956-0020 FOR THE TIME AT LEAST THAN WHEN OCEANS LAY BETWIXT THEIR BIRTH AND THEIR MEETING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING BACK WITH VAGUE LONGING EVEN TO THE TERRIBLE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON
7278-246956-0021 AND THE SHARING OF THEIR AGONY THEREIN HIS EYES FOLLOWED HER AS SHE WALKED ACROSS TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND THE TEARS ROSE AND FILLED THEM BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND THE SISTER WHO ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON
7278-246956-0023 NOW CAST ON HIM A CHILLY GLANCE AND SAID NEVER A WORD OF THE THINGS TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH HEAVINGS OF THE SPIRIT OCEAN FOR SHE FELT WITH AN INSTINCT MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN HER WILL
7278-246956-0024 THAT THEY WOULD BUT STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER THE TEACHER OF THEM MIGHT APPROVE AS SHE REPASSED HIM TO GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE DID INDEED SAY A WORD OF KINDNESS BUT IT WAS IN A FORCED TONE
7278-246956-0026 IN ORDER THEREBY TO ATTAIN TO A BETTER INNOCENCE THAN WITHOUT IT COULD EVER BE THEIRS HOW FAR SHE MISTOOK OR HOW FAR SHE KNEW OR SUSPECTED THAT SHE SPOKE FALSELY I WILL NOT PRETEND TO KNOW BUT ALTHOUGH SHE SPOKE AS SHE DID
7278-246956-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THE CURATE OR IN THE SERMON THAT HAD QUIETED HER A LITTLE AND SHE WAS LESS CONTEMPTUOUS IN HER CONDEMNATION OF HIM THAN USUAL HAPPILY BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS THE CURATE
7278-246956-0029 OCCASION TO THE DISHONEST TO CAVIL AND CONDEMN IMAGINE SAINT PAUL HAVING A PREVISION OF HOW HE WOULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND HEEDING IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF ALL THOSE HIS MOST MAGNIFICENT OUTBURSTS AND WOULD ANY AMOUNT OF
7278-246956-0030 APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
7278-246956-0032 LET HIM PREACH AGAIN TO ENFORCE THE TRUTH FOR WHICH HE IS JEALOUS AND IF IT SHOULD SEEM TO ANY THAT THE TWO UTTERANCES NEED RECONCILING LET THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE THEM CONSISTENT RECONCILE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
7278-246956-0033 THAT AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HE HAD MOUNTED HELEN'S MARE AND SET OUT TO CALL ON MISTER HOOKER

7302-86814-0006 IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE
7302-86814-0008 SOON RECOVERED ITS GLOSS IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE STILL PERFECT FOR THE WEARER TRIED HIS BEST TO MAKE IT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF A NEW COAT HE BESTOWED THE SAME ATTENTION UPON THE CAMBRIC FRONT OF A SHIRT WHICH HAD CONSIDERABLY CHANGED IN COLOR

7302-86814-0015 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY

7302-86814-0018 ROLLED HIS TONGUE AROUND HIS CHEEKS AND SMACKED HIS LIPS IN A MANNER EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED WORDS AMONG THE BANDITS WHEN FORCED TO BE SILENT IT WAS A MASONIC SIGN CADEROUSSE HAD TAUGHT HIM

7312-92432-0023 AND OF THE BIRTH AND BAPTISM OF HER CHILD AFTER A FEW WORDS MORE I TOOK MY DEPARTURE THE HOUR SHE NAMED HAVING NEARLY ARRIVED AT THE PORTER'S LODGE I MET THE MARQUIS OSSOLI

7367-86737-0013 IN AN HOUR IN AN HOUR IT WILL BE AT THE DOOR AN HOUR AFTER THE VEHICLE WAS AT THE DOOR IT WAS A HACK CONVEYANCE WHICH WAS ELEVATED TO THE RANK OF A PRIVATE CARRIAGE IN HONOR OF THE OCCASION BUT IN SPITE OF ITS HUMBLE EXTERIOR
7367-86737-0015 SHALL I BRING THE CARRIAGE NEARER TO THE PALACE ACCUSTOMED AS FRANZ WAS TO THE ITALIAN PHRASEOLOGY HIS FIRST IMPULSE WAS TO LOOK ROUND HIM BUT THESE WORDS WERE ADDRESSED TO HIM FRANZ WAS THE EXCELLENCY
7367-86737-0016 WAS THE PALACE THE GENIUS FOR LAUDATION CHARACTERISTIC OF THE RACE WAS IN THAT PHRASE FRANZ AND ALBERT DESCENDED THE CARRIAGE APPROACHED THE PALACE THEIR EXCELLENCIES STRETCHED THEIR LEGS ALONG THE SEATS
7367-86737-0018 SUDDENLY THE DAYLIGHT BEGAN TO FADE AWAY FRANZ TOOK OUT HIS WATCH IT WAS HALF PAST FOUR THEY RETURNED TO THE HOTEL AT THE DOOR FRANZ ORDERED THE COACHMAN TO BE READY AT EIGHT HE WISHED TO SHOW ALBERT THE COLOSSEUM BY MOONLIGHT
7367-86737-0019 AS HE HAD SHOWN HIM SAINT PETER'S BY DAYLIGHT WHEN WE SHOW A FRIEND A CITY ONE HAS ALREADY VISITED WE FEEL THE SAME PRIDE AS WHEN WE POINT OUT A WOMAN WHOSE LOVER WE HAVE BEEN
7367-86737-0021 BUT AT THE FIRST WORDS HE WAS INTERRUPTED EXCELLENCY SAID PASTRINI I AM DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOUR APPROBATION BUT IT WAS NOT FOR THAT I CAME
7367-86737-0022 WHEN YOU ARE TOLD ANYTHING CANNOT BE DONE THERE IS AN END OF IT IT IS MUCH MORE CONVENIENT AT PARIS WHEN ANYTHING CANNOT BE DONE YOU PAY DOUBLE AND IT IS DONE DIRECTLY THAT IS WHAT ALL THE FRENCH SAY RETURNED SIGNOR PASTRINI SOMEWHAT PIQUED
7367-86737-0024 OR BLOCKHEADS LIKE US EVER DO TRAVEL MEN IN THEIR SENSES DO NOT QUIT THEIR HOTEL IN THE RUE DU HELDER THEIR WALK ON THE BOULEVARD DE GAND AND THE CAFE DE PARIS IT
7367-86737-0025 SIGNOR PASTRINI REMAINED SILENT A SHORT TIME IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS MUSING OVER THIS ANSWER WHICH DID NOT SEEM VERY CLEAR BUT SAID FRANZ IN HIS TURN INTERRUPTING HIS HOST'S MEDITATIONS
7367-86737-0027 WHAT DO YOU NOT KNOW HIM I HAVE NOT THAT HONOR YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD HIS NAME NEVER WELL THEN HE IS A BANDIT COMPARED TO WHOM THE DECESARIS AND THE GASPARONES WERE MERE CHILDREN
7367-86737-0028 NOW THEN ALBERT CRIED FRANZ HERE IS A BANDIT FOR YOU AT LAST I FOREWARN YOU SIGNOR PASTRINI THAT I SHALL NOT BELIEVE ONE WORD OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US HAVING TOLD YOU THIS BEGIN
7367-86737-0030 EXCELLENCY SAID HE GRAVELY ADDRESSING FRANZ IF YOU LOOK UPON ME AS A LIAR IT IS USELESS FOR ME TO SAY ANYTHING IT WAS FOR YOUR INTEREST ALBERT DOES NOT SAY YOU ARE A LIAR SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ
7367-86737-0031 BUT THAT HE WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO TELL US BUT I WILL BELIEVE ALL YOU SAY SO PROCEED BUT IF YOUR EXCELLENCY DOUBT MY VERACITY SIGNOR PASTRINI RETURNED FRANZ
7367-86737-0033 WELL WHAT HAS THIS BANDIT TO DO WITH THE ORDER I HAVE GIVEN THE COACHMAN TO LEAVE THE CITY BY THE PORTA DEL POPOLO
7367-86737-0034 THIS REPLIED SIGNOR PASTRINI THAT YOU WILL GO OUT BY ONE BUT I VERY MUCH DOUBT YOUR RETURNING BY THE OTHER WHY ASKED FRANZ BECAUSE AFTER NIGHTFALL YOU ARE NOT SAFE FIFTY YARDS FROM THE GATES
7367-86737-0036 AND KNOWS TOO THAT THESE THINGS ARE NOT TO BE LAUGHED AT MY DEAR FELLOW SAID ALBERT TURNING TO FRANZ HERE IS AN ADMIRABLE ADVENTURE WE WILL FILL OUR CARRIAGE WITH PISTOLS BLUNDERBUSSES AND DOUBLE BARRELLED GUNS
7367-86737-0037 LUIGI VAMPA COMES TO TAKE US AND WE TAKE HIM WE BRING HIM BACK TO ROME AND PRESENT HIM TO HIS HOLINESS THE POPE WHO ASKS HOW HE CAN REPAY SO GREAT A SERVICE THEN WE MERELY ASK FOR A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES AND WE SEE THE CARNIVAL IN THE CARRIAGE
7367-86737-0039 SIGNOR PASTRINI'S FACE ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE AND PRAY ASKED FRANZ WHERE ARE THESE PISTOLS BLUNDERBUSSES AND OTHER DEADLY WEAPONS WITH WHICH YOU INTEND FILLING THE CARRIAGE NOT OUT OF MY ARMORY
7367-86737-0040 FOR AT TERRACINA I WAS PLUNDERED EVEN OF MY HUNTING KNIFE
7367-86737-0042 YOUR ANSWER IS SUBLIME AND WORTHY THE LET HIM DIE OF CORNEILLE ONLY WHEN HORACE MADE THAT ANSWER THE SAFETY OF ROME WAS CONCERNED
7367-86737-0043 ALBERT POURED HIMSELF OUT A GLASS OF LACRYMA CHRISTI WHICH HE SIPPED AT INTERVALS MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS WELL SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ NOW THAT MY COMPANION IS QUIETED AND YOU HAVE SEEN HOW PEACEFUL MY INTENTIONS ARE
7367-86737-0045 YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
7367-86737-0046 RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
7367-86737-0048 AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
7367-86737-0049 AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
7367-86737-0051 HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
7367-86737-0052 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
7367-86737-0054 AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
7367-86737-0055 WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
7367-86737-0091 WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0096 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0097 DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0100 THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
7367-86737-0102 RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
7367-86737-0103 RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
7367-86737-0105 BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
7367-86737-0106 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0108 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0111 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
7367-86737-0114 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7367-86737-0115 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7367-86737-0117 HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
7367-86737-0118 HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
7402-59171-0001 AND HE DOES EXPRESS AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING WITHOUT MAKING A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE SHAKE THEIR FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER HIS LIFE AT LEAST HIS PUBLIC LIFE
7402-59171-0002 HE HAS GONE ABOUT LIKE A PICKPOCKET OF ILLUSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF LITERATURE TO THE WORLD OF MORALS AND FROM THE WORLD OF MORALS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS AND EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE AN INNUMERABLE GROWL HAS FOLLOWED HIM
7402-59171-0004 BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
7402-59171-0005 SEEMS LIKE LIFE IN RUINS ARE FILLED AT TIMES WITH A WILD LUST TO DENOUNCE AND BELITTLE HIM HE HAS BEEN CALLED MORE NAMES THAN ANY OTHER MAN OF LETTERS ALIVE
7402-59171-0007 WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
7402-59171-0008 PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
7402-59171-0010 STOP ADVERTISING MYSELF ON THE CONTRARY I MUST DO IT MORE THAN EVER LOOK AT PEARS'S SOAP THERE IS A SOLID HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT EVERY WALL IS STILL PLASTERED WITH THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS IF I WERE TO GIVE UP ADVERTISING
7402-59171-0011 MY BUSINESS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO FALL OFF YOU BLAME ME FOR HAVING DECLARED MYSELF TO BE THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN OF MY TIME BUT THE CLAIM IS AN ARGUABLE ONE WHY SHOULD I NOT SAY IT WHEN I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE
7402-59171-0013 UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT HE IS AN ARTIST NOT ONLY IN THE INVENTION OF HIS OWN LIFE BUT IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE HIS BROADBENT IS AS WONDERFUL A FIGURE AS HIS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW NOT THAT HIS PORTRAITURE IS ALWAYS FAITHFUL
7402-59171-0014 HE SEES MEN AND WOMEN TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE REFRACTING SHALLOWS OF THEORIES HE IS A DOCTRINAIRE AND HIS CHARACTERS ARE OFTEN COMIC STATEMENTS OF HIS DOCTRINES RATHER THAN THE REFLECTIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN
7402-59171-0016 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0017 RATHER WHEN HE IS PRESENTING A QUEER FIZZING MIXTURE OF HUMAN NATURE AND HIS OPINIONS ABOUT IT THIS MAY BE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY A VIRTUE IN HIS COMEDY CERTAINLY FROM THE TIME OF ARISTOPHANES ONWARDS
7402-59171-0019 THE REDEMPTION OF ALL THINGS BY BEAUTY EVERLASTING AND THE MESSAGE OF ART THAT HAS MADE THESE HANDS BLESSED AMEN AMEN THESE SENTENCES ARE NO MORE NATURAL OR NATURALISTIC
7402-59171-0020 WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF HUMANITY REPEATING MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE CREED OF ARTISTS THERE IS A SIMILAR FALSIFICATION IN THE SAME PLAY IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO IS PRESENT AT DUBEDAT'S DEATH
7402-59171-0022 BY A HURRIED ALTERATION OF ATMOSPHERE IN THIS MANNER COMEDY AS WELL AS TRAGEDY MUST CREATE SOME KIND OF ILLUSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ILLUSION EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF A JOKE MAY MEAN THE DESTRUCTION OF LAUGHTER
7402-59171-0023 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0025 IT IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AMID ALL HIS FALSIFICATIONS DOCTRINAL AND JOCULAR HE HAS A GENUINE COMIC SENSE OF CHARACTER MOST FRENCH CRITICS
7402-59171-0026 DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
7402-59171-0028 AND THE CHARACTERIZATION IN MOLIERE IN SHAW'S PLAYS THE CHARACTERS ARE LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF VICES OR PASSIONS THAN THOSE OF MOLIERE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF CLASS PROFESSION OR SECT
7402-59171-0029 MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
7402-59171-0031 OF FARCE AND SO FORTH IS A SUGGESTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO CRITICISM I AM NOT SURE THAT THE COMPARISON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY PUT IN A CHAPTER THAN A BOOK
7402-59171-0032 IS INTENDED AS A BIOGRAPHY AND GENERAL CRITICISM OF MISTER SHAW AS WELL AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN HIS WORK AND MOLIERE'S IT CONTAINS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A GREAT DEAL THAT IS NOT NEW TO ENGLISH READERS
7402-59171-0034 IS AN OFFERING AT A SHRINE THE TRUE THINGS IT CONTAINS HOWEVER MAKE IT WORTH READING
7402-59171-0035 FOR INSTANCE WHAT MANY CRITICS HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT IN HIS DRAMATIC WORK MISTER SHAW IS LESS A WIT THAN A HUMORIST IN SHAW'S WORK WE FIND FEW STUDIED JESTS FEW EPIGRAMS EVEN
7402-59171-0037 THE DEFENCE OF MISTER SHAW HOWEVER DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY REAL OR IMAGINARY RESEMBLANCE OF HIS PLAYS TO MOLIERE'S HIS JOY AND HIS MISERY BEFORE THE LUDICROUS SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE ARE HIS OWN AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THEM
7402-59171-0038 IS HIS OWN HE HAS STUDIED WITH HIS OWN EYES THE SWOLLEN BELLIED PRETENCES OF PREACHERS AND POETS AND RICH MEN AND LOVERS AND POLITICIANS AND HE HAS DERIDED THEM AS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DERIDED ON THE ENGLISH STAGE BEFORE
7402-59171-0040 HE HAS DONE THIS SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE EXUBERANCE OF MIRTH SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF A SATIRIST EVEN HIS BITTERNESS IS NEVER VENOMOUS HOWEVER HE IS GENIAL BEYOND THE MAJORITY OF INVETERATE CONTROVERSIALISTS AND PROPAGANDISTS
7402-59171-0041 HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
7402-59171-0043 THAT HE WAS NOT INTENSELY SERIOUS IN ALL THAT HE WROTE ABOUT THE WAR BUT HIS SERIOUSNESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SERIOUSNESS OF IN THE HIGHER SENSE OF THE WORD THE COMIC ARTIST OF THE DISILLUSIONIST
7402-59171-0044 HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
7402-59171-0046 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A PRO GERMAN THE FACT IS IN WAR TIME MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME PEOPLE DREAD THE VISION OF THE SATIRIST AND THE SCEPTIC
7402-59171-0047 THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE MISTER SHAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION OF POLITICS THAT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN BRILLIANT CHALLENGING AND HUMANE AND NOT MORE WAYWARD THAN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PARTISAN
7402-90848-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS AN OLD WIDOW WOMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS THE FIRST TWO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THE THIRD BOBO BY NAME WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SILLY SIMPLETON ALL HIS MOTHER'S SCOLDINGS AND BEATINGS
7402-90848-0001 AND SHE SMACKED THE POOR LAD SOUNDLY A DOZEN TIMES A DAY DID HIM NO GOOD WHATEVER NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MORNING PRINCESS ZENZA THE RULER OF THE LAND HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE COTTAGE AND HEARD BOBO BEING GIVEN A TERRIBLE TONGUE LASHING
7402-90848-0003 NOW HE WOULD BE SENT TO FIND A WHITE CRAW'S FEATHER OR A SPRAY OF YELLOW BLUEBELLS NOW HE WAS ORDERED TO LOOK FOR A SQUARE WHEEL OR A GLASS OF DRY WATER EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM THAT IS
7402-90848-0004 EVERYBODY EXCEPT LITTLE TILDA THE KITCHEN MAID WHEN POOR BOBO USED TO RETURN FROM SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE TIRED OUT MUD STAINED AND OFTEN ENOUGH WET TO THE SKIN
7402-90848-0006 ONE PLEASANT MID SUMMER MORNING WHEN BOBO HAD BEEN NEARLY A YEAR AT THE CASTLE PRINCESS ZENZA OVERSLEPT HALF AN HOUR AND DID NOT COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST AT THE USUAL TIME WHEN SHE DID GET UP SHE FOUND HER COURT WAITING FOR HER IN THE CASTLE GARDENS
7402-90848-0007 SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
7402-90848-0009 GOOD BYE BOBO CRIED THE ASSEMBLED COURTIERS WHO WERE ALMOST BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH LAUGHTER AT THE SIMPLETON AND HIS ERRAND DON'T FAIL TO BRING BACK THE LOST HALF HOUR SO BOBO RODE OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY
7402-90848-0010 IT WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND WORE TORTOISE SHELL GLASSES BUT BOBO HAD TO ANSWER NO AND THE OLD MAN WANDERED ON AGAIN ANOTHER DAY THE SIMPLETON ENCOUNTERED A TALL DARK FIERCE KIND OF FELLOW
7402-90848-0012 I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I'VE LOST MYSELF I'VE LOST MY TEMPER
7402-90848-0013 ANSWER ME YOU SILLY HAVE YOU SEEN A LOST TEMPER ANYWHERE IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE MELON AND HAS SHARP LITTLE POINTS ON BOBO'S ANSWERING NO THIS DREADFUL PERSON UTTERED SO PERFECTLY AWFUL A SCREECH OF RAGE
7402-90848-0015 HERE THE POOR OLD KING TOOK OUT A GREAT GREEN HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES SHE WAS STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES ON MIDSUMMER EVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FIND HER WORTHY BOBO AND AN IMMENSE REWARD WILL BE YOURS
7402-90848-0016 AND HE CONTINUED HIS WAY ON FOOT THREE LONG YEARS PASSED AND BOBO GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD BUT REMAINED A SIMPLETON STILL FINALLY AFTER HE HAD WANDERED ALL ABOUT FAIRYLAND HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE SEA
7402-90848-0018 SO BOBO WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND SAILED OUT UPON THE DARK SEA FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND CLEAR BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN FAR OFF HER COURSE INTO THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
7402-90848-0019 AND WAS WRECKED UPON A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF ROCKS THAT SHONE IN THE NIGHT LIKE WET MATCHES A GREAT WAVE SWEPT THE DECKS AND BOBO WAS BORNE AWAY FROM HIS COMPANIONS AND CARRIED TOWARD THE SHINING LAND
7402-90848-0021 LOOKING ABOUT BOBO FOUND HIMSELF ON A LOVELY ISLAND WHOSE HEART WAS A HIGH MOUNTAIN MASS HIDDEN IN THE FOG STILL SWEEPING IN FROM THE SEA THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE A ROAD OR A PATH TO BE SEEN
7402-90848-0022 IN WHICH WERE A PAIR OF WOODEN SHOES ABOVE THE SHOES WAS A CARD SAYING SIMPLY
7402-90848-0024 SO BOBO OBEDIENTLY LET THE SHOES GUIDE HIM AT CORNERS THE SHOES ALWAYS TURNED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF BOBO FORGOT AND BLUNDERED ON THE WRONG WAY THE SHOES SWIFTLY BEGAN TO PINCH HIS TOES
7402-90848-0025 FOR TWO DAYS BOBO WALKED INLAND TOWARD THE GREAT MOUNTAIN A WARM WIND BLEW THE CLOUDS AND RAIN AWAY THE SUN SHONE SWEET AND CLEAR ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY THE SIMPLETON ENTERED A WOOD OF TALL SILENT TREES
7402-90848-0027 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN LYING BETWEEN THE CASTLE WALLS AND THE RISING SLOPES OF A GREAT MOUNTAIN STRANGE TO SAY NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN AND THOUGH THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE CASTLE
7402-90848-0028 THERE WAS NOT EVEN A WARDER AT THE GATE SUDDENLY A GREAT BOOMING BELL STRUCK SEVEN O'CLOCK BOBO BEGAN TO HEAR VOICES AND SOUNDS AND THEN BEFORE THE HUMMING OF THE BELL HAD DIED AWAY
7402-90848-0030 STOOD BY THE GATE TO SEE THE HORSEMAN RIDE AWAY PLUCKING UP COURAGE BOBO CAME FORWARD FELL ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE OLD MAN AND TOLD HIS STORY TRULY YOU SHOULD THANK THE STORM FAIRIES SAID THE OLD MAN
7402-90848-0031 FOR HAD YOU NOT BEEN WRECKED UPON THIS ISLAND NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOST HALF HOUR I AM FATHER TIME HIMSELF AND THESE ARE MY TWELVE SONS THE HOURS EVERY DAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7402-90848-0033 BOBO WILLINGLY AGREED SO TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE HOURS TOOK HIM TO THE STABLES AND SHOWED HIM THE LITTLE ROOM IN THE TURRET THAT HE WAS TO HAVE
7402-90848-0034 HE TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF THE GREAT BLACK HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THE WHITE HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE DAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER MORE PROUD AND STRONG NOR THEIR COATS SMOOTHER AND MORE GLEAMING WHEN THE YEAR WAS UP BOBO AGAIN SOUGHT OUT FATHER TIME
7402-90848-0036 DON'T TRY TO PEEK AT IT OR OPEN THE BOX UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME HAS COME IF YOU DO THE HALF HOUR WILL FLYAWAY AND DISAPPEAR FOREVER FAREWELL BOBO SAID KIND YOUNG TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO HAD BEEN THE SIMPLETON'S GOOD FRIEND
7402-90848-0037 I TOO HAVE A GIFT FOR THEE DRINK THIS CUP OF WATER TO THE LAST DROP AND THE YOUTH HANDED THE SIMPLETON A SILVER CUP FULL TO THE BRIM OF CLEAR SHINING WATER NOW THIS WATER WAS THE WATER OF WISDOM
7402-90848-0039 TELL THE FIRST SAID FATHER TIME THAT HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO A THOUSAND PIECES WHICH HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY HIS NEIGHBORS AND CARRIED HOME IF HE CAN PERSUADE HIS NEIGHBORS TO GIVE THEM UP
7402-90848-0040 AS FOR THE MISSING DAUGHTER SHE IS THE KITCHEN MAID IN PRINCESS ZENZA'S PALACE WHO IS KNOWN AS TILDA SO BOBO THANKED FATHER TIME AND AT NOON
7402-90848-0042 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SEASHORE THE WHITE HORSE HESITATED NOT AN INSTANT BUT SET FOOT UPON THE WATER WHICH BORE HIM UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN NOT WATER BUT EARTH ITSELF
7402-90848-0043 BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7402-90848-0045 IN A WORD THE GREATEST NOBLEMAN IN ALL FAIRYLAND
7402-90848-0046 ALL IN SPLENDID SILKS AND SOLDIERS IN SHINING ARMOR THE DELIGHTED KING RODE OFF TO CLAIM HIS MISSING DAUGHTER FROM PRINCESS ZENZA SO ON THEY RODE THE HARNESSES JINGLING THE BRIDLE BELLS RINGING
7402-90848-0048 ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES SAT AN OLD WOMAN ALL ALONE AND WEEPING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY GOOD WOMAN SAID THE KING
7402-90848-0049 EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
7402-90848-0051 THAT WE ARE MOURNING AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE IS TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THE DRAGON IT IS ALMOST TWO NOW ALAS ALAS HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE TOWN BELL STRUCK TWICE SOLEMNLY AND SADLY
7402-90848-0052 QUICK QUICK CRIED THE KING AND BOBO IN THE SAME BREATH LET US HURRY TO THE CASTLE WE MAY SAVE HER YET BUT THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY WERE TOO LATE AND THAT POOR TILDA HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO THE DRAGON
7402-90848-0054 THINGS SHOULD BE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE OPENED THE COVER OF THE EBONY BOX SOMETHING LIKE A WINGED WHITE FLAME ESCAPED FROM IT AND FLEW HISSING THROUGH THE AIR TO THE SUN
7402-90848-0055 AS FOR THE SUN ITSELF TURNING ROUND LIKE A CARTWHEEL AND HISSING LIKE TEN THOUSAND ROCKETS IT ROLLED BACK ALONG THE SKY TO THE EAST THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKS WHICH MARKED HALF PAST TWO WHIRRED BACK TO TWO O'CLOCK IN A TWINKLING
7402-90848-0057 THE DRAGON WAS ADVANCING TOWARD HER BOBO RAN DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND STOOD BESIDE TILDA READY TO DEFEND HER TO THE END THE DRAGON CAME NEARER AND NEARER SUDDENLY
7402-90848-0058 ANGERED BY THE SIGHT OF BOBO AND HIS DRAWN SWORD HE ROARED ANGRILY BUT CONTINUED TO APPROACH BOBO STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS SWORD THE BLADE BROKE UPON HIS STEELY SCALES THE DRAGON ROARED AGAIN NOW
7402-90848-0060 FOR THE DRAGON HAD BLOWN UP THE LOST TEMPER HAD FINISHED HIM ONLY ONE FRAGMENT OF HIM A TINY BIT OF A CLAW WAS EVER FOUND
7402-90848-0061 THE GRAND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE BLACK CAT WAS CONFERRED UPON BOBO BY PRINCESS ZENZA WHO ALSO ASKED HIS PARDON FOR HAVING TREATED HIM SO SHABBILY THIS BOBO GAVE READILY
7447-91186-0000 HOW SOON KEYS WERE ADDED TO THE MONOCHORD AS THIS MEASURING INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED CANNOT POSITIVELY BE ASCERTAINED WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME IT WAS NOT SLOW IN ADOPTING THE RUDE KEYBOARD ASCRIBED BY TRADITION TO PAN PIPES
7447-91186-0001 AND APPLIED TO THE PORTABLE ORGAN OF EARLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONOCHORD SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST TWO OR MORE STRINGS OF EQUAL LENGTH ARE NOW DIVIDED
7447-91186-0003 WERE BROUGHT TO ACT ON A FEW STRINGS COMMANDING OFTEN THREE OCTAVES
7447-91186-0004 THE FAMOUS SIGHT READING MUSIC TEACHER OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ADVISED HIS PUPILS TO EXERCISE THE HAND IN THE USE OF THE MONOCHORD SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEYBOARD THE KEYED MONOCHORD GAINED THE NAME
7447-91186-0006 OR KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS THAT CAME INTO USE DANCE MUSIC FOUND IN THEM A CONGENIAL FIELD
7447-91186-0007 I ANSWER THAT YOU CANNOT YET OWING TO YOUR YOUTH UNDERSTAND THAT PLAYING IS ONLY SUITED FOR VOLATILE FRIVOLOUS WOMEN WHEREAS I DESIRE YOU TO BE THE MOST LOVABLE MAIDEN IN THE WORLD
7447-91186-0009 CONSIDER A MOMENT WHETHER THIS WOULD BECOME YOU IF YOUR FRIENDS WISH YOU TO PLAY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM PLEASURE TELL THEM YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS IN THEIR EYES AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS
7447-91186-0010 A DIFFERENT VIEW WAS ENTERTAINED IN ENGLAND DURING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN WHERE CLAVIERS WERE IN VOGUE STYLED VIRGINALS BECAUSE AS AN ANCIENT CHRONICLE EXPLAINED VIRGINS DO MOST COMMONLY PLAY ON THEM
7447-91186-0012 IF SHE ACTUALLY DID JUSTICE TO SOME OF THE AIRS WITH VARIATIONS IN THE QUEEN ELIZABETH VIRGINAL BOOK SHE MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN PROFICIENT ON THE INSTRUMENT QUAINT DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY
7447-91186-0013 SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARES IN HIS HISTORY OF MUSIC THAT NO PERFORMER OF HIS DAY COULD PLAY THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A MONTH'S PRACTICE
7447-91186-0015 BECAME THE FIRST CLAVIER MASTER HE AND DOCTOR JOHN BULL
7447-91186-0016 REPRESENT THE TWO TYPES WHICH RUN THROUGH THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE CLAVIER BYRD WAS THE MORE INTIMATE DELICATE SPIRITUAL INTELLECT BULL THE UNTAMED GENIUS THE BRILLIANT
7447-91186-0018 THE FOUNDING OF WHOSE CHAIR OF MUSIC IS POPULARLY ATTRIBUTED TO ALFRED THE GREAT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLAVIERS HAD APPEARED WHOSE STRINGS WERE PLUCKED BY QUILLS
7447-91186-0019 ATTACHED TO JACKS AT THE END OF THE KEY LEVERS TO THIS GROUP BELONGED THE VIRGINAL OR VIRGINALS THE CLAVICEMBALO THE HARPSICHORD OR CLAVECIN AND THE SPINET STOPS WERE ADDED AS IN THE ORGAN
7447-91186-0021 THE SECULAR MUSIC PRINCIPLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THAT CALLED INTO ACTIVE BEING THE ORCHESTRA LED ALSO TO A DESIRE FOR RICHER MUSICAL EXPRESSION IN HOME AND SOCIAL LIFE THAN THE FASHIONABLE LUTE AFFORDED
7447-91186-0022 AND THE CLAVIER ADVANCED IN FAVOR IN FRANCE BY FIFTEEN THIRTY THE DANCE THAT PROMOTER OF PURE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WAS FREELY TRANSCRIBED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY
7447-91186-0024 NOW WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN ALTHOUGH ONCE MENTIONED IN THE SAME BREATH WITH MOLIERE WROTE THE PIONEER CLAVIER INSTRUCTION BOOK IN IT HE DIRECTS SCHOLARS HOW TO AVOID A HARSH TONE AND HOW TO FORM A LEGATO STYLE
7447-91186-0025 HE ADVISES PARENTS TO SELECT TEACHERS ON WHOM IMPLICIT RELIANCE MAY BE PLACED AND TEACHERS TO KEEP THE CLAVIERS OF BEGINNERS UNDER LOCK AND KEY THAT THERE MAY BE NO PRACTICING WITHOUT SUPERVISION HIS SUGGESTIONS DESERVE CONSIDERATION TO DAY
7447-91186-0027 DESIGNED TO DEPICT SENTIMENTS MOODS PHASES OF CHARACTER AND SCENES FROM LIFE HE FASHIONED MANY CHARMING TURNS OF EXPRESSION INTRODUCED AN OCCASIONAL TEMPO RUBATO FORESHADOWED THE INTELLECTUAL
7447-91186-0028 ELEMENT IN MUSIC AND LAID THE CORNER STONE OF MODERN PIANO PLAYING JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU
7447-91186-0030 AND JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH
7447-91186-0031 THE GERMAN OF GERMANS THE STYLE OF SCARLATTI IS PECULIARLY THE PRODUCT OF ITALIAN LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL TONE
7447-91186-0033 AMATEUR OR PROFESSOR WHOEVER THOU ART SEEK NOT IN THESE COMPOSITIONS FOR ANY PROFOUND FEELING THEY ARE ONLY A FROLIC OF ART MEANT TO INCREASE THY CONFIDENCE IN THE CLAVIER
7447-91186-0034 IN GERMANY WITH GRAND OLD FATHER BACH THE KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND CAPABLE OF MIRRORING A MIGHTY SOUL THE GERM OF ALL MODERN MUSICAL DESIGN LIES IN HIS CLAVIER WRITINGS
7447-91186-0036 HAVE EXTOLLED HIM FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS MELODIES AND HARMONIES THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF HIS MODULATIONS THE WEALTH SPONTANEITY AND LOGICAL CLEARNESS OF HIS IDEAS AND THE SUPERB ARCHITECTURE OF HIS PRODUCTIONS
7447-91186-0037 STUDENTS MISS THE SOUL OF BACH BECAUSE OF THE SOULLESS MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY DEFACE HIS LEGACY TO THEM HIS TWELVE LITTLE PRELUDES ALONE CONTAIN THE MATERIALS FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF MUSIC THE INVENTIONS
7447-91186-0039 AND JUST DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE ELEMENTS OF MUSICAL TASTE AS WELL AS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF THE FINGERS HIS WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD HAS BEEN CALLED THE PIANIST'S SACRED BOOK
7447-91186-0040 ITS PRELUDES AND FUGUES ILLUSTRATE EVERY SHADE OF HUMAN FEELING AND WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO EXEMPLIFY THE MODE OF TUNING KNOWN AS EQUAL TEMPERAMENT INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL USE BY BACH
7447-91186-0042 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91186-0043 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0056 INDICATIONS OF IT IN BACH ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BEETHOVEN USED IT EFFECTIVELY CHOPIN APPROPRIATED IT AS ONE OF HIS MOST POTENT AUXILIARIES IN PLAYING HE EMPHASIZED THE SAYING OF MOZART
7447-91187-0058 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0059 CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0061 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7447-91187-0064 DISCUSSING THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHOPIN IN HIS DELIGHTFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK CHOPIN THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC CALLS THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS
7447-91187-0065 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0067 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7505-83618-0000 THEIR CULTURE MYTH WHICH HE HAS RECORDED
7505-83618-0001 THE BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIM AT EVERY STEP AND AS IT FELL TURNED INTO FLINT STONES THE VICTOR RETURNED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND ESTABLISHED HIS LODGE IN THE FAR EAST ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT OCEAN WHENCE THE SUN COMES IN TIME HE BECAME THE FATHER OF MANKIND
7505-83618-0003 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0006 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0007 BUT IN PSYCHOLOGY MAN CHIEFLY COGNIZANT OF HIS SOUL THROUGH HIS SENSES THOUGHT WITH AN AWFUL HORROR OF THE NIGHT WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF ONE AND FORESHADOWED THE LOSS OF ALL THEREFORE
7505-83618-0009 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0012 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0013 FOR ASKED THE INCAS
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7505-83618-0016 TEACHER OF ALL THINGS AT LAST HE DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN OCEAN FOUR PERSONAGES COMPANIONS OR SONS WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM
7505-83618-0018 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0021 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE
7505-83618-0022 YOLCUAT THE RATTLESNAKE TOHIL THE RUMBLER HUEMAC THE STRONG HAND
7505-83618-0024 HE WAS FIGURATIVELY SAID TO SWEEP THE ROAD FOR HIM SINCE IN THAT COUNTRY VIOLENT WINDS ARE THE PRECURSORS OF THE WET SEASONS WHEREVER HE WENT ALL MANNER OF SINGING BIRDS BORE HIM COMPANY EMBLEMS OF THE WHISTLING BREEZES
7505-83618-0025 THE HILL OF SHOUTING WITH SUCH A MIGHTY VOICE THAT IT COULD BE HEARD A HUNDRED LEAGUES AROUND THE ARROWS WHICH HE SHOT TRANSFIXED GREAT TREES THE STONES HE THREW LEVELLED FORESTS
7505-258958-0000 SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION BEING ONLY TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ECONOMIC WANTS APPEAR IN MORE OR LESS REGULARLY RECURRING SERIES IMPRESSIONS ARE SHORT LIVED SENSATIONS ARE TEMPORARY
7505-258958-0001 WANTS THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED RECUR WANTS RECUR FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THEY FIRST AROSE NO IMPRESSION ON THE NERVES OR ON THE SENSES IS LASTING
7505-258958-0003 IN ITS POWER TO GRATIFY WANTS THE CLOSER THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT OF WANTS AND THAT OF GOODS THE GREATER WILL BE THE TOTAL OF GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0004 OR BY SOCIETY DURING THE INCOME PERIOD THE TERM NATIONAL OR SOCIAL INCOME MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL OR PRIVATE INCOME IN THE OBJECTIVE SENSE
7505-258958-0006 THE OBJECTIVE INCOME OF SOCIETY BEING THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE GOODS ACQUIRED OR PARTED WITH BY ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER SOCIAL OR PRIVATE OBJECTIVE INCOMES INCLUDE ONLY MATERIAL GOODS
7505-258958-0007 FOR MANY UTILITIES AND LABOR SERVICES THAT NEVER TAKE ON A MATERIAL OR MONEY EXPRESSION ARE INCLUDED IN EITHER CASE INDEED WE ARE CLOSE HERE TO THE CONCEPTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7505-258958-0009 AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
7505-258958-0010 MEN MAKE USE OF OTHER GOODS WHILE THEY ARE STORING UP A SUPPLY OF WOOD OR COAL IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE INCOME BUT THEY MAY BURN IT TO HELP GROW HOTHOUSE PLANTS
7505-258958-0012 THE GOODS THAT COME INTO A MAN'S POSSESSION IN ANY PERIOD ARE OF MANY SORTS TO GET SOME HE HAS DESTROYED MANY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GOODS
7505-258958-0013 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0015 A CROP OF CORN IS NOT ALL INCOME IN A TIME OF FAMINE IT COULD BE USED BUT SEED CORN WAS SAVED FROM LAST YEAR
7505-258958-0016 IT IS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING CALLED WEALTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SOONER OR LATER IN SOME WAY TO THE SUM OF GRATIFICATIONS IT IS FOR THAT REASON IT IS CALLED WEALTH IT IS HOWEVER
7505-258958-0018 BETWEEN PRESENT AND FUTURE INCOMES THE VALUE OF THE MASS OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION AND YIELDING INCOME RESTS IN LARGE PART UPON ITS POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO INCOME IN SOME FUTURE PERIOD THUS
7505-258958-0019 SUCH AS LANDS RAILROAD STOCKS GOVERNMENT BONDS ET CETERA THE INCOME IS FUNDED BECAUSE IT CORRESPONDS TO AN ABIDING FUND OF WEALTH THE INCOME ARISING FROM CURRENT LABOR IS UNFUNDED
7505-258958-0021 IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
7505-258958-0022 THE REAL INCOME BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT INCOME IN THE MOST ESSENTIAL SENSE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEN CANNOT BE FEELINGS THEY CAN ONLY CALL OUT OR OCCASION FEELING
7505-258958-0024 MEN TALK OF MATERIAL INCOME AS CONSISTING OF BUSHELS OF WHEAT HEAD OF CATTLE ET CETERA AND OF IMMATERIAL INCOME AS THE USES THAT DURABLE GOODS YIELD DIRECTLY
7505-258958-0025 OR THAT MEN PERFORM FOR EACH OTHER E G THOSE OF THE SINGER PHYSICIAN TEACHER JUDGE ALL SERVICES THAT DO NOT TAKE ON MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0027 THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
7505-258958-0028 ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION IN QUESTION HE IS A PRODUCTIVE LABORER BECAUSE HIS SERVICES ARE EMBODIED IN MATERIAL FORM WHEREAS THE LECTURER IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE LABORER
7505-258958-0030 BUT A SIMILAR DISTINCTION IS INCONSISTENTLY PRESERVED BY MANY WRITERS IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL THINGS A BUILDING USED AS A FACTORY IS CALLED PRODUCTIVE
7505-258958-0031 BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
7505-258958-0033 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0034 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0006 ENABLING THEM TO CARRY A GREATER AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WITHIN A YEAR
7505-258964-0007 THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
7505-258964-0009 THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
7505-258964-0010 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0013 THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
7505-258964-0015 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0016 THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO BE WHERE MOST USEFUL TO THE OWNER A MAN HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS KEEPS ONE AT HIS OFFICE AND THE OTHER AT HOME A STUDENT HAVING TWO BOOKS OF THE SAME KIND
7505-258964-0018 SOME OF THE GROUPINGS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL WORLD THAT DO NOT FIT MAN'S PURPOSES MAY BE MADE TO DO SO
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0024 WHEN IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF LAND TAKE PLACE AND THE PRODUCT THUS IS INCREASED AND CHEAPENED THE POORER LAND IS ABANDONED
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0027 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0033 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0034 MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
7505-258964-0036 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0042 AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
7505-258964-0043 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0045 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0046 THEIR HIGH VALUE IS DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION THE CARS MULES DYNAMOS STEAM ENGINES
7505-258964-0048 DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
7505-258964-0049 CAN BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IN ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE WAYS THE OWNER OF A LARGE FACTORY MOVING IT INTO THE COUNTRY MAY BUY UP SURROUNDING LAND AND FOUND A CITY CONVERTING PASTURE LANDS AND CORN FIELDS
7505-258964-0051 AS WELL AS OF GAIN THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED IN RECENT YEARS
7511-102419-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST SEPTEMBER TWELFTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY
7511-102419-0002 TO BEGIN WITH THE MORNING WE LEFT THE HOLTS ELIZABETH SUGGESTED THAT WE THREE WOMEN RIDE IN THE BUCKBOARD SO I SEATED MYSELF ON A ROLL OF BEDDING IN THE BACK PART
7511-102419-0003 THE SKY WAS CLEAR BLUE
7511-102419-0005 AND THE STATELY PINES KEPT WHISPERING AND MURMURING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE CHIDING THE QUAKING ASPENS FOR BEING FRIVOLOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD LAY THE RIVER BORDERED BY WILLOWS AND GRASSY FLATS
7511-102419-0006 THERE WERE MANY SMALL LAKES AND THE DUCKS AND GEESE WERE NOISILY ENJOYING THEMSELVES AMONG THE RUSHES AND WATER GRASSES BEYOND THE RIVER ROSE THE FOREST COVERED MOUNTAINS HILL UPON HILL ELIZABETH DRESSED WITH ESPECIAL CARE THAT MORNING
7511-102419-0008 I NEVER SAW SUCH A COUNTRY AS THE WEST
7511-102419-0009 AND I NEVER SAW SUCH PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE FED ME CARED FOR ME AND BEFRIENDED ME A STRANGER
7511-102419-0011 WILL BE THE GREATEST HELP TO ME IN BECOMING WHAT I HOPE TO BECOME A REAL WESTERNER I MIGHT HAVE LIVED A LONG TIME IN THE WEST AND NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD MANY THINGS IF I HAD NOT FALLEN INTO YOUR HANDS YEARS AGO
7511-102419-0012 BEFORE I WAS THROUGH SCHOOL I WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT I LOST MY MOTHER JUST THEN AND WAS LEFT THE CARE OF MY PARALYTIC FATHER IF I HAD MARRIED THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE FATHER FROM HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS BECAUSE WALLACE CAME WEST IN THE FORESTRY SERVICE
7511-102419-0014 I COULD TAKE CARE OF FATHER AND TEACH ALSO WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLY SITUATED AND IN TIME BECAME REALLY HAPPY ALTHOUGH I SELDOM HEARD FROM WALLACE HIS LETTERS WERE WELL WORTH WAITING FOR AND I KNEW HE WAS DOING WELL
7511-102419-0015 EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO FATHER DIED GENTLY WENT TO SLEEP I WAITED SIX MONTHS AND THEN WROTE TO WALLACE BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
7511-102419-0017 SUPPOSIN IT'S MARRIED YOUR MAN IS WALLACE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT ME BUT HE WOULD NOT MARRY WITHOUT TELLING ME IF HE IS ALIVE HE IS HONORABLE THEN I ASKED
7511-102419-0018 IF HE IS STATIONED IN THE BRIDGES RESERVE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW OF HIM AT ANY OF THESE LITTLE PLACES I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE ONLY I THINK I OWE IT TO YOU AND IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE OF THE HOLTS
7511-102419-0020 AND WE HELD OUR BREATH UNTIL WE EMERGED ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER SORENSON IS A VERY CAPABLE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GAME WARDEN AND A VERY GENIAL GENTLEMAN HE RODE DOWN TO MEET US
7511-102419-0021 TO INSPECT OUR LICENSE AND TO TELL US ABOUT OUR PRIVILEGES AND OUR DUTIES AS GOOD WOODSMEN HE ALSO ISSUES LICENSES IN CASE HUNTERS HAVE NEGLECTED TO SECURE THEM BEFORE COMING MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAD REFUSED TO GET A LICENSE WHEN WE DID
7511-102419-0023 AS WE WERE STARTING MISTER STEWART ASKED THE GAME WARDEN CAN YOU TELL ME IF WALLACE WHITE IS STILL STATIONED HERE OH YES MISTER SORENSON SAID WALLACE'S PLACE IS ONLY A FEW MILES UP THE RIVER AND CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN FROM THE ROAD WE DROVE ON
7511-102419-0024 HAPPINESS HAD TAKEN A NEW CLUTCH UPON MY HEART I LOOKED BACK EXPECTING TO SEE ELIZABETH ALL SMILES BUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THE FOOLISH GIRL WAS SOBBING AS IF HER HEART WAS BROKEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY DREW HER HEAD DOWN UPON HER SHOULDER
7511-102419-0026 MISTER STEWART SAID WE MIGHT AS WELL NOON AS SOON AS WE CAME TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN HE WOULD RIDE ACROSS AND SEE MISTER WHITE JUST AS WE ROUNDED THE HILL A HORSEMAN CAME TOWARD US A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS
7511-102419-0027 MANLY STRENGTH AND GRACE SHOWING IN EVERY LINE THE ROAD WAS NARROW AGAINST THE HILLSIDE AND HE HAD TO RIDE QUITE CLOSE SO I SAW HIS HANDSOME FACE PLAINLY AS SOON AS HE SAW ELIZABETH HE SPRANG FROM HIS SADDLE AND SAID LIZ'BETH LIZ'BETH
7511-102419-0029 INSTEAD OF LETTING ME ENJOY THE TABLEAU HE SOLEMNLY DROVE ON SAYING HE WOULD NOT WANT ANY ONE GAWKING AT HIM IF HE WERE THE HAPPY MAN ANYWAY HE COULDN'T URGE CHUB FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MY SEEING AND HEARING WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
7511-102419-0030 BESIDES THAT I SAW THAT ELIZABETH'S HAT WAS ON AWRY HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES RED IT WAS DISAPPOINTING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL TO LOOK NICELY MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME TROTTING ALONG AND WE STOPPED FOR DINNER
7511-102419-0032 THEY WERE GOING TO START IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER ON HORSEBACK FOR THE COUNTY SEAT TO BE MARRIED AFTER WE HAD EATEN ELIZABETH SELECTED A FEW THINGS FROM HER TRUNK AND MISTER STEWART AND MISTER WHITE DROVE THE BUCKBOARD ACROSS THE RIVER TO LEAVE THE TRUNK IN ITS NEW HOME
7511-102419-0033 WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
7511-102419-0035 I BELIEVE SHE IS ONE HAPPY BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHONE ON IF THE OMEN HAS FAILED EVERYWHERE ELSE WELL WE FELT POWERFULLY REDUCED IN NUMBERS BUT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON WE CAME UPON MISTER STRUBLE AND MISTER HAYNES
7511-102419-0036 WAITING BESIDE THE ROAD FOR US THEY HAD COME TO PILOT US INTO CAMP FOR THERE WOULD BE NO ROAD SOON SUCH A WAY AS WE CAME OVER SUCH JOLTING AND SLIDING I BEGGED TO GET OFF AND WALK
7511-102419-0038 AND I COULD HEAR HER IMPLORING ALL THE SAINTS TO PRESERVE US FROM INSTANT DEATH I KEPT SHUTTING MY EYES TRYING NOT TO SEE THE TERRIFYING PLACES AND OPENING THEM AGAIN TO SEE THE BEAUTY SPREAD EVERYWHERE UNTIL MISTER STEWART SAID
7511-102419-0039 IT MUST MAKE YOU NERVOUS TO RIDE OVER MOUNTAIN ROADS DON'T BAT YOUR EYES SO FAST AND YOU'LL SEE MORE SO THEN I STIFFENED MY BACK AND KEPT MY EYES OPEN AND I DID SEE MORE IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO GO AS FAR AS WE COULD WITH THE WAGONS AND THEN SET CAMP
7511-102419-0041 LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN
7511-102419-0042 OUR TENTS ARE SET UNDER SOME BIG TREES ON A SMALL PLATEAU AND RIGHT BELOW US IS A VALLEY IN WHICH GRASS GROWS KNEE HIGH AND LITTLE STREAMS COME FROM EVERY WAY TROUT SCURRY UP STREAM WHENEVER WE GO NEAR
7511-102419-0044 THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
7511-102419-0045 MISTER STRUBLE HAS ALREADY KILLED A FINE SPIKE ELK FOR CAMP EATING WE CAMPED IN A BUNCH AND WE HAVE CAMP STOVES SO THAT IN CASE OF RAIN OR SNOW WE CAN STAY INDOORS JUST NOW WE HAVE A HUGE CAMP FIRE
7511-102419-0047 BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS YESTERDAY WE HAD PIE MADE OF WILD CURRANTS THERE ARE A POWERFUL LOT OF THEM HERE THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BLUEBERRY THAT THE MEN SAY IS THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HUCKLEBERRY THE GROUSE ARE FEEDING ON THEM
7511-102419-0048 ALTOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE THE MEN ARE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HUNTING A LITTLE DELAY MEANS COOLER WEATHER FOR THE MEAT IT IS COOL UP HERE BUT GOING BACK ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL BE WARM FOR A WHILE YET STILL
7511-102419-0050 AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
7511-102419-0051 HE IS TALL AND STRONG AND WE FIND HIM VERY PLEASANT COMPANY THEN THERE IS DOCTOR TESCHALL HE IS A QUIET FELLOW WITH AN UNEXPECTED SMILE HE IS SO RESERVED THAT I FELT THAT HE WAS KIND OF OUT OF PLACE AMONG THE REST UNTIL I CAUGHT HIS CORDIAL SMILE
7511-102419-0053 HE LOOKS TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD BUT WHOOPS AND LAUGHS LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE GOOD MON DO I HE IS JUST THE KIND QUIET GOOD MON THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HIM
7511-102419-0054 HE TOLD MISTER HAYNES HE WAS TOO TAM SEEK IN DE BEL SO WE HAD TO COME WITHOUT HIM
7511-102419-0056 I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
7511-102420-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST OCTOBER SIXTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY IT SEEMS SO ODD TO BE WRITING YOU AND GETTING NO ANSWERS
7511-102420-0002 ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0003 FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0005 WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0008 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009 THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0011 GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0014 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0017 ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0020 BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021 ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0023 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0026 THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0032 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033 WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0035 HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0038 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0041 SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0044 DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045 HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0047 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
7511-102420-0050 BUT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO RUN NIGGER RUN AND THE OLD GRAY HOSS COME A TEARIN OUT THE WILDERNESS I'LL SING THEM TO YOU WHEN I COME TO DENVER
7517-100429-0000 THE POND MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S POND STANDS AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND IS REACHED BY A WELL DRAINED GRAVEL PATH SO THAT IN ANY WEATHER ONE MAY WALK
7517-100429-0002 A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE BATH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AT THE ZOO BENEATH THE WATERS OF WHICH IF YOU PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO POINT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS OUT TO SOMEBODY HE ALWAYS LIES HIDDEN TO THE REST OF US
7517-100429-0003 IT IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE POND A DESIGNATION WHICH IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL NEIGHBOURING PONDS THE GIFTS OF NATURE AND GIVES THE WHOLE CREDIT TO THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
7517-100429-0005 THUS THE STEPS HELP TO MAKE THE POND A CONVENIENT RAIN GAUGE FOR OBVIOUSLY WHEN ONLY THREE STEPS ARE LEFT UNCOVERED AS WAS THE CASE LAST MONDAY
7517-100429-0006 WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
7517-100429-0008 FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
7517-100429-0009 HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
7517-100429-0011 AND PLANNED THE POND ACCORDINGLY A MOST NECESSARY THING IN A COUNTRY HOUSE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECOGNIZED MEETING PLACE
7517-100429-0012 WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRITING A FEW LETTERS AFTER BREAKFAST MAY WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED MEET THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF WRITING ANY AND ARRANGE PLANS WITH THEM FOR THE MORNING
7517-100429-0014 RIGHT OH SHE SAYS WILLINGLY ENOUGH HAVING SPENT THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH THE TIMES FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT ALL OF THE PAPER THAT IS LEFT TO THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST RUSH FOR THE CRICKET NEWS
7517-100429-0015 WE WANDER DOWN TO THE POND TOGETHER AND PERHAPS FIND BROWN AND MISS SMITH THERE A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT SAYS BROWN IT WAS ONLY JUST OVER THE THIRD STEP AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY
7517-100429-0017 BY AND BY TWO OR THREE OTHERS STROLL UP AND WE ALL MAKE MEASUREMENTS TOGETHER THE GENERAL OPINION IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT
7517-100429-0018 MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
7517-100429-0020 FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS
7517-100429-0021 TO BE DISINCLINED TO LEAVE IT TILL LUNCH TIME A MAN OR WOMAN AS LAZY AS THIS MUST NOT BE RUSHED SAY TO SUCH A ONE COME AND PLAY AND THE INVITATION
7517-100429-0023 ALL THIS FOR THOSE DELIGHTFUL SUMMER DAYS WHEN THERE ARE FINE INTERVALS BUT CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF THE POND WHEN THE RAIN STREAMS DOWN IN TORRENTS
7517-100429-0024 FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HOW TIRED WE GET OF BEING INDOORS ON THESE DAYS EVEN WITH THE BEST OF BOOKS THE PLEASANTEST OF COMPANIONS THE EASIEST OF BILLIARD TABLES
7517-100429-0026 ER I WAS JUST GOING TO ER WALK ABOUT A BIT BUT NOW WE TELL HER BRIGHTLY I'M GOING TO SEE THE POND IT MUST BE NEARLY FULL WON'T YOU COME TOO AND WITH ANY LUCK SHE COMES
7517-100429-0027 TO THESE STREAMING DAYS TO REFLECT THAT IT ALL GOES TO FILL THE POND FOR THERE IS EVER BEFORE OUR MINDS THAT GREAT MOMENT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE POND IS AT LAST FULL
7517-100429-0029 I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROMISED SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A BROAD AND FRIENDLY OUTLOOK TOWARDS RAIN GAUGES WILL BE SURE TO ARRANGE SOMETHING STRIKING WHEN THE GREAT MOMENT ARRIVES
7517-100429-0030 WILL HELP TO CELEBRATE IT I HAVE NO DOUBT WITH AN OPEN AIR PLAY TANK DRAMA OR WHAT NOT AT ANY RATE WE HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL EMPTY THE POND AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
7517-100429-0032 HAVE FALLEN IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
7517-100437-0000 A HOUSEHOLD BOOK ONCE ON A TIME I DISCOVERED SAMUEL BUTLER NOT THE OTHER TWO BUT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE WAY OF ALL FLESH THE SECOND BEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
7517-100437-0002 WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
7517-100437-0003 IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
7517-100437-0005 MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
7517-100437-0006 BUT I DARE NOT RISK IT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR SCORN AT MY PREVIOUS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TILLIER YOUR AMUSED CONTEMPT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED
7517-100437-0008 WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF CLAUDE TILLIER
7517-100437-0009 WHO HAS NOT READ IT IN FRENCH OR AS I DID IN AMERICAN LET US PASS ON TO ANOTHER BOOK FOR I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER DISCOVERY
7517-100437-0011 OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER WHEN I TELL YOU HIS NAME YOU WILL SAY OH YES I LOVE HIS BOOKS AND YOU WILL MENTION SO AND SO AND ITS EQUALLY FAMOUS SEQUEL SUCH AND SUCH
7517-100437-0012 BUT WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE READ MY BOOK YOU WILL PROFESS SURPRISE AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT IS IT AS GOOD AS SO AND SO AND SUCH AND SUCH YOU WILL ASK
7517-100437-0014 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7517-100437-0015 ARE THE GOLDEN AGE AND DREAM DAYS AM I NOT RIGHT THANK YOU BUT THE BOOK YOU HAVE NOT READ MY BOOK
7517-100437-0017 FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING IT USUALLY I SPEAK ABOUT IT AT MY FIRST MEETING WITH A STRANGER IT IS MY OPENING REMARK JUST AS YOURS IS SOMETHING FUTILE ABOUT THE WEATHER
7517-100437-0018 IF I DON'T GET IT IN AT THE BEGINNING I SQUEEZE IT IN AT THE END THE STRANGER HAS GOT TO HAVE IT SOME TIME SHOULD I EVER FIND MYSELF IN THE DOCK AND ONE NEVER KNOWS
7517-100437-0020 WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
7517-100437-0021 WHETHER IT IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT IT IS THE AMAZING TRUTH THAT NONE OF THOSE HUNDREDS HAD HEARD OF THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS UNTIL I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0023 GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS TWO EARLIER FAMOUS BOOKS BUT IGNORANT THEREAFTER I HAD THEIR PROMISE BEFORE THEY LEFT ME AND WAITED CONFIDENTLY
7517-100437-0024 FOR THEIR GRATITUDE NO DOUBT THEY ALSO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS IN THEIR TURN AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT REACHED YOU IN THIS WAY BUT IT WAS TO ME
7517-100437-0026 PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IT WAS I WHO INTRODUCED THAT NOVELIST TO IT SIX MONTHS BEFORE INDEED I FEEL SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS I WHO WROTE THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS
7517-100437-0027 AND RECOMMENDED IT TO KENNETH GRAHAME BUT PERHAPS I AM WRONG HERE FOR I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY LAMENTED AM I FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN ITS SALE
7517-100437-0029 THAT IT IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEHOLD BOOK BY A HOUSEHOLD BOOK I MEAN A BOOK WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD LOVES AND QUOTES CONTINUALLY EVER AFTERWARDS A BOOK WHICH IS READ ALOUD
7517-100437-0030 TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
7517-100437-0032 WHEN HE WROTE IT I HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE JONES WERE HIS FINAL WORDS AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN WELL OF COURSE YOU WILL ORDER THE BOOK AT ONCE
7517-100437-0033 BUT I MUST GIVE YOU ONE WORD OF WARNING WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO IT DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS AS TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY TASTE
7517-100442-0000 AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
7517-100442-0001 BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
7517-100442-0003 AND LORDLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WITH A PINT OF CHERRY GIN IS NOT THIS TO FOLLOW THE KING OF TRADES SOME DAY I SHALL OPEN A GROCER'S SHOP AND YOU WILL FIND ME IN MY SPARE EVENINGS
7517-100442-0004 APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
7517-100442-0006 BUT NO CURRANTS THIS EVENING I BEG YOU YES TO BE A GROCER IS TO LIVE WELL BUT AFTER ALL IT IS NOT TO SEE LIFE A GROCER
7517-100442-0007 IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
7517-100442-0009 I PERCEIVE NOW THAT I WAS OVER HASTY IN DECIDING TO BECOME A GROCER THAT IS RATHER FOR ONE'S OLD AGE WHILE ONE IS YOUNG AND INTERESTED IN PERSONS RATHER THAN IN THINGS
7517-100442-0010 THERE IS ONLY ONE PROFESSION TO FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF BOOKSTALL CLERK TO BE BEHIND A BOOKSTALL IS INDEED TO SEE LIFE THE FASCINATION OF IT STRUCK ME SUDDENLY
7517-100442-0012 YES AND HE WOULD KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL HIS PAPERS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS AND TO KNOW THIS IS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
7517-100442-0013 YOU CANNOT TELL A MAN BY THE LOBSTER HE EATS BUT YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BY THE LITERATURE HE READS FOR INSTANCE I ONCE OCCUPIED A CARRIAGE ON AN EASTERN LINE
7517-100442-0015 AND ATE HIM WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE EMPTIED THE ENDS OUT OF THE WINDOW WIPED HER HANDS AND SETTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY TO HER PAPER WHAT PAPER YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
7517-100442-0016 I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
7517-100442-0018 THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
7517-100442-0019 HE WANTS CAGE BIRDS THAT ONE OVER THERE WANTS THE MOTOR AH WELL THE AUTO CAR THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH SOON HE WOULD BEGIN TO KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES HE WOULD LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
7517-100442-0021 A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
7517-100442-0022 AND THEY WOULD BE VERY RARE HIS FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WOULD BEGIN TO OOZE AWAY UNTIL ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD TELL HIMSELF EXCITEDLY THAT THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL IN DISGUISE
7517-100442-0024 BUT HE HAS OTHER THINGS THAN PAPERS TO SELL HE KNOWS WHO BUYS THOSE LITTLE SIXPENNY BOOKS OF FUNNY STORIES A PROBLEM WHICH HAS OFTEN PUZZLED US OTHERS
7517-100442-0025 HE UNDERSTANDS BY NOW THE TYPE OF MAN WHO WANTS TO READ UP A FEW GOOD JOKES TO TELL THEM DOWN AT OLD ROBINSON'S WHERE HE IS GOING FOR THE WEEK END OUR BOOKSTALL CLERK DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED
7517-100442-0027 WHO IS ALWAYS LOSING HIS INDIARUBBER UMBRELLA RING HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATION HE CAN SEE HIM AND HE HASTENS TO GET A NEW CARD OUT IN READINESS OR WE WOULD LET YOU HAVE SEVEN FOR SIXPENCE SIR
7517-100442-0028 AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
7517-100442-0030 ONE OF OUR GREATEST SOLDIERS I THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS LAST MONDAY AND DEFINITELY RENOUNCED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A GROCER AND AS I WANDERED ROUND THE BOOKSTALL THINKING
7517-100442-0031 I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES
7517-100442-0033 THAT AN INTERESTING ARTICLE MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM IT SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY ENOUGH I LEFT IT IN THE TRAIN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO MASTER IT I SHALL BE AT THE BOOKSTALL NEXT MONDAY
7517-100442-0034 AND I SHALL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER COPY THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU SHAN'T MISS IT BUT I AM WONDERING NOW WHAT THE BOOKSTALL CLERK WILL MAKE OF ME A MAN WHO KEEPS ON BUYING PROVERBS AND MAXIMS
7635-105409-0001 THE VOICE CAME NEARER AND NEARER IN THE VAST IMMENSITY OF THESE LONELY CLIFFS WITH THE LOUD MURMUR OF THE SEA BELOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW NEAR OR HOW FAR NOR YET FROM WHICH DIRECTION CAME THAT CHEERFUL SINGER WHO SANG TO GOD TO SAVE HIS KING WHILST HE HIMSELF WAS IN SUCH DEADLY DANGER
7635-105409-0002 FELT THAT HER VERY LIFE WAS SLIPPING AWAY AS IF WHEN THAT VOICE DREW NEARER WHEN THAT SINGER BECAME ENTRAPPED SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CLICK OF DESGAS GUN CLOSE TO HER NO NO NO NO OH GOD IN HEAVEN THIS CANNOT BE
7635-105409-0004 ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
7635-105409-0005 PERCY MY HUSBAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FLY ARMAND ARMAND WHY DON'T YOU FIRE
7635-105409-0007 THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
7635-105409-0008 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0010 WAS FOR THE MOMENT PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE SAW THE SOLDIERS STANDING THERE AT ATTENTION LIKE SENTRIES ON GUARD WHILST NOT A SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE HUT FILLED WITH STRANGE ANXIOUS FOREBODING HE TOO WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND PEERING INTO THE GLOOM HE ASKED QUICKLY
7635-105409-0011 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0013 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0016 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
7635-105409-0017 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0019 TO WAIT FOR THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS THE IMPORTANT CAPTURE THEY HAD NO DOUBT REACHED ONE OF THE CREEKS WHICH JUT FAR OUT TO SEA ON THIS COAST AT INTERVALS BEHIND THIS THE BOAT OF THE DAY DREAM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM
7635-105409-0020 IT NEEDED ALL CHAUVELIN'S NERVE AND PRESENCE OF MIND NOT TO GIVE WAY TO A USELESS AND UNDIGNIFIED ACCESS OF RAGE
7635-105409-0022 THERE WERE NO FAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS ABOUT
7635-105409-0023 BY THAT TIME THE FOUR FUGITIVES MUST HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND GOT INTO THE BOAT AND THE NEAREST CREEK WAS MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HUT WHERE HAD THAT DARING SINGER GOT TO UNLESS SATAN HIMSELF HAD LENT HIM WINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE COVERED THAT MILE ON A ROCKY CLIFF IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
7635-105409-0025 WE WERE TOO LATE CITOYEN THE SOLDIER SAID WE REACHED THE BEACH JUST BEFORE THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY THAT BANK OF CLOUDS THE BOAT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BEHIND THAT FIRST CREEK A MILE OFF BUT SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE GOT TO THE BEACH AND WAS ALREADY SOME WAY OUT TO SEA
7635-105409-0026 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0029 IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
7635-105409-0031 I CANNOT QUITE REACH YOU WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIVES AND ENDANGERING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESCUE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS WAIT TWO MINUTES THEN CREEP OUT OF THE HUT ONE BY ONE TURN TO YOUR LEFT SHARPLY AND CREEP CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE CLIFF
7635-105409-0032 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0034 THAT PHRASE MIGHT YET MEAN VICTORY FOR HIM WHICH OF YOU KNOWS THIS COAST WELL HE SHOUTED TO HIS MEN WHO NOW ONE BY ONE ALL RETURNED FROM THEIR FRUITLESS RUN AND WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ONCE MORE ROUND THE HUT
7635-105409-0035 THERE IS CITOYEN I KNOW IT WELL THE ENGLISHMAN IS HOPING TO REACH THAT CREEK
7635-105409-0037 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
7635-105409-0038 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0040 HER EYES CIRCLED BY DEEP PURPLE LINES THAT TOLD OF LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HER HAIR MATTED AND DAMP ROUND HER FOREHEAD HER LIPS PARTED IN A SHARP CURVE THAT SPOKE OF PHYSICAL PAIN
7635-105409-0041 BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
7635-105409-0043 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0046 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0050 B BUT YOUR HONOUR THERE IS NO BUT I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER
7635-105409-0052 IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
7635-105409-0053 BUT ADDED CHAUVELIN WITH SLOW EMPHASIS IF YOU DECEIVED ME IN YOUR PROMISE YOU WERE TO HAVE A SOUND BEATING ONE THAT WOULD TEACH YOU NOT TO TELL LIES I DID NOT YOUR HONOUR I SWEAR IT BY ABRAHAM
7635-105409-0055 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0058 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0061 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0064 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0065 LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
7635-105409-0067 WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
7635-105409-0068 I MUCH REGRET FAIR LADY HE SAID IN HIS MOST SUAVE TONES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE FOR THE MOMENT BUT I GO AWAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT LEAVE YOU UNPROTECTED
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
7635-105661-0001 MAY SAFELY BE INTRUSTED TO THE LIBERALITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR DOCTRINES AND WHO FIND BENEFIT OR CONSOLATION FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL MINISTRY AND ASSISTANCE
7635-105661-0002 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0004 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0007 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0010 THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
7635-105661-0011 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0014 THOUGH SHE POSSESSED LARGE REVENUES WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH HER ACQUISITIONS
7635-105661-0016 AND THUS THAT CHURCH THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME ESTABLISHMENT WAS LIABLE TO MANY OF THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH BELONG TO AN ORDER OF PRIESTS TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN ART AND INVENTION FOR OBTAINING A SUBSISTENCE
7635-105661-0017 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0019 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0022 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0025 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0028 WERE PROPAGATED MORE QUICKLY AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THE MINDS OF MEN SOMEWHAT AWAKENED FROM A PROFOUND SLEEP OF SO MANY CENTURIES WERE PREPARED FOR EVERY NOVELTY AND SCRUPLED LESS TO TREAD IN ANY UNUSUAL PATH WHICH WAS OPENED TO THEM
7635-105661-0029 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0031 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0034 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0037 IN A MYSTERIOUS SPECIES OF FAITH IN INWARD VISION RAPTURE AND ECSTASY THE NEW SECTARIES SEIZED WITH THIS SPIRIT WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE
7635-105661-0038 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0041 THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
7635-105661-0043 DIED IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE A LITTLE AFTER HE RECEIVED THE KING'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER AND HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE PAPAL CHAIR BY ADRIAN A FLEMING WHO HAD BEEN TUTOR TO THE EMPEROR CHARLES THIS MAN WAS FITTED TO GAIN ON THE REFORMERS BY THE INTEGRITY CANDOR
7635-105661-0044 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0046 AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
7635-105661-0047 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0049 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
7780-274562-0000 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0002 FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
7780-274562-0003 THE PERSON OF WHOM I SPEAK SEEMED BORN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORESHADOWING THE WILD DOCTRINES OF TURGOT PRICE PRIESTLEY AND CONDORCET OF EXEMPLIFYING BY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCE
7780-274562-0005 THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
7780-274562-0006 THAT AS A SPECIES WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION THE AS YET UNWROUGHT ELEMENTS OF CONTENT AND THAT EVEN NOW IN THE PRESENT BLINDNESS AND DARKNESS OF ALL IDEA ON THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION
7780-274562-0008 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0009 EXPERIENCE MISTER ELLISON WOULD HAVE FOUND HIMSELF PRECIPITATED BY THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF HIS LIFE INTO THE COMMON VORTEX OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH YAWNS FOR THOSE OF PREEMINENT ENDOWMENTS
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0012 ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
7780-274562-0014 HIS FOURTH WAS AN OBJECT OF UNCEASING PURSUIT AND HE HELD THAT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE EXTENT OF HAPPINESS WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF THIS OBJECT
7780-274562-0015 I HAVE SAID THAT ELLISON WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE IN PERSONAL GRACE AND BEAUTY HE EXCEEDED ALL MEN
7780-274562-0017 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0020 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0021 MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
7780-274562-0023 FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
7780-274562-0024 THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0027 OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
7780-274562-0029 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0030 WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0033 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0035 OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
7780-274562-0036 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0038 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0041 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0044 WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
7780-274562-0045 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT HAS DECLARED THIS SENTIMENT CAPABLE OF EXPATIATING I MEAN THE MOST LIBERAL PUBLIC OR RECOGNIZED CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA INVOLVED IN THE PHRASE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0047 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0050 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0051 ITS ADAPTATION TO THE EYES WHICH WERE TO BEHOLD IT UPON EARTH IN HIS EXPLANATION OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY MISTER ELLISON DID MUCH TOWARDS SOLVING WHAT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME AN ENIGMA I MEAN THE FACT
7780-274562-0053 WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
7780-274562-0054 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0056 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0062 YET HIS REASONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MATURED INTO EXPRESSION IT REMAINS FOR A MORE PROFOUND ANALYSIS THAN THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN FULLY TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPRESS THEM
7780-274562-0063 IN HIS INSTINCTIVE OPINIONS BY THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL HIS COMPEERS LET A COMPOSITION BE DEFECTIVE LET AN EMENDATION BE WROUGHT IN ITS MERE ARRANGEMENT OF FORM
7780-274562-0065 EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0068 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0069 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
7780-274562-0071 OR OF THE COLLATERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SERVE TO CORROBORATE OR SUSTAIN THERE MIGHT BE A CLASS OF BEINGS HUMAN ONCE BUT NOW TO HUMANITY INVISIBLE
7780-274562-0072 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0074 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0075 DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
7780-274562-0077 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0078 WHICH BEARS SOME RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE GARDENING
7780-274562-0080 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0083 WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
7780-274562-0084 THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
7780-274562-0086 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0089 WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
7780-274562-0090 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0092 IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
7780-274562-0093 ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
7780-274562-0095 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0096 SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
7780-274562-0098 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
7780-274562-0099 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7780-274562-0102 IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE HANDIWORK OF THE ANGELS THAT HOVER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IT WAS IN DEVOTING HIS GIGANTIC WEALTH TO THE PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT OF A VISION SUCH AS THIS
7780-274562-0104 IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
7780-274562-0105 THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
7794-295947-0001 SO THAT THEY RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BUT TWO OF THE BOYS HELD DOWN THE CUB AND SEIZING IT BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WENT OFF IN HIGH GLEE THE TWO FRIENDS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE AND ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS VOICE SHOUTED OUT
7794-295947-0002 HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
7794-295947-0004 AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
7794-295947-0005 AND GAVE HALF A BU TO THE THREE BOYS WHO RAN AWAY DELIGHTED THE MAN'S FRIEND UPON THIS SAID TO HIM WELL CERTAINLY YOU HAVE GOT QUEER TASTES WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FOX FOR
7794-295947-0007 BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
7794-295947-0008 THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
7794-295947-0010 LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
7794-295947-0011 SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
7794-295947-0013 EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
7794-295947-0014 WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
7794-295947-0016 LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
7794-295947-0017 WHEN HE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND SAID INDEED I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS KINDNESS WHICH WILL SAVE MY SON'S LIFE THEN THE GOOD WIFE CAME OUT AND RECEIVED THE JAR WITH EVERY MARK OF POLITENESS
7794-295947-0019 AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
7794-295947-0020 WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
7794-295947-0022 WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
7794-295947-0023 PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
7794-295947-0025 LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
7794-295947-0026 I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
7794-295947-0028 WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
7794-295947-0029 AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
7794-295947-0031 WE HAD CONFIDED THE COMMISSION CAME HERE WITH IT HIS MATE HAS JUST BEEN AT MY PILLOW SIDE AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT HENCE IT WAS THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS MOVED TO TEARS
7794-295947-0032 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
7794-295947-0034 THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
7794-295947-0035 THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
7794-295947-0037 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0038 A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
7794-295947-0040 IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
7794-295947-0041 ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
7794-295947-0043 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295947-0044 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295947-0046 AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0026 WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
7794-295955-0000 THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
7794-295955-0002 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0008 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0011 AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
7794-295955-0012 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0014 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0017 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0020 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0021 AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
7794-295955-0023 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0024 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
7794-295955-0027 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0029 SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
7794-295955-0030 HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
7800-283478-0000 AS THE FRONT DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN AND AN EXCITED MAN HURRIED DOWN THE STEPS TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE FOUR CHUMS STOOD BREATHING HARD AFTER THEIR RECENT EXERTIONS IT'S OLD ISAAC CHASE THE MEANEST MAN IN CENTERVILLE EXCLAIMED JERRY IN DISMAY

7800-283478-0010 THE INNOCENT OFTEN HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THE GUILTY SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS AT THIS POINT TRIED TO CONVINCE MISTER CHASE THAT FRANK WAS ENTIRELY INNOCENT OF THE WHOLE TRANSACTION BUT THE MISER ACTING ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH
7800-283478-0012 THE SOONER THAT WINDOW PANE IS REPLACED THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED THAT'S ENOUGH WITH THAT HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE GROUP AND HURRIED TO REENTER HIS HOUSE AS THOUGH FEARFUL LEST SOME OF THE SPECTATORS MIGHT ENDEAVOR TO SHAME HIM OUT OF ACCEPTING PAY FROM AN INNOCENT PARTY
7800-283478-0013 FRANK AND HIS THREE COMRADES STOOD TALKING WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD GATHERED WHEN THE CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FOLLOWED BY ANGRY WORDS IN THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE OF THE MISER DREW ATTENTION TO THE SCENE OF ACTION COME LET'S BE MOVING ALONG FELLOWS BLUFF FINALLY REMARKED

7800-283492-0002 WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE FRANK THOUGHT THAT THE WOUNDED BOY MUST TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DISCUSSION WHY WHO ELSE WOULD TRY TO TURN ON MISTER DARREL THAT WAY AND BURN HIS SHANTIES DOWN JUST WHEN WINTER IS SETTING IN ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0004 AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
7800-283492-0005 OH NOW I TUMBLE TO WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED WILL WHO DID NOT OFTEN USE ANY SORT OF SLANG AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY EXCITED TO FALL INTO THE HABIT IT'S BILL BILL NACKERSON FRANK NODDED HIS HEAD
7800-283492-0007 YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
7800-283492-0008 WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
7800-283492-0010 AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
7800-283492-0011 I SAW HIS HEAD THOUGH AFTER A BIT WHEN WE HAD TALKED MATTERS OVER HE WENT BACK TO THE FIRE AGAIN
7800-283492-0013 THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
7800-283492-0014 AFTER NACKERSON STRUCK TEDDY THE BOY HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR HIM BOASTING ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT TO DO TO THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN OH I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEAN FRANK
7800-283492-0016 HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN HIS HEAD TO SHIELD A RASCAL WHO DIDN'T HESITATE TO STRIKE HIM A COWARDLY BLOW BLUFF WAS NOT SLOW OF COMPREHENSION
7800-283492-0017 JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
7800-283492-0019 BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
7800-283492-0020 WHEW IT DOES TAKE YOU TO SEE THROUGH THINGS BLUFF DECLARED WITH A LAUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THAT IT WAS A BIG STREAK OF LUCK FOR TED WHEN HE MET WITH THAT BEAR TRAP WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE WELL OFF DO WE
7800-283492-0022 SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
7800-283492-0023 HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET OVER THE NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY FOLLOWING HIS ADVENT IN THE NEW CAMP
7800-283492-0025 HE HAD TO BE SHOWN VERY LITTLE SO AS TO SUIT THEIR TASTES AND NONE OF THEM REGRETTED IN THE LEAST THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED A HELPING HAND TOWARD ONE IN DISTRESS A NEW LIFE WAS OPENING UP TO TEDDY
7800-283492-0026 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE LOT OF COMPANIONS AND EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY HE TRIED TO PROVE HIMSELF GRATEFUL STILL HE DID NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW OF THE DASTARDLY DEED
7800-283492-0028 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD
7800-283492-0029 FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
7800-283492-0031 I'D GUESS IT WAS GOING TO STRIKE US BEFORE NIGHT WE'VE GOT OFF PRETTY FORTUNATELY SO FAR ABOUT STORMS BLUFF WENT ON AS HE THREW ANOTHER ARMFUL OF FUEL ON THE ALREADY HUGE PILE
7800-283492-0032 AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
7800-283492-0034 IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0035 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING OFF TO THE PLACE WHERE WE DISCOVERED THAT COMICAL COLONY OF SQUIRRELS THAT AMUSED US YESTERDAY FRANK EXPLAINED HE HOPED BY KEEPING AS STILL AS A MOUSE TO GET A SNAP AT THEM WHEN THEY WERE CARRYING ON THAT WAY
7800-283492-0037 HE LOOKS EXCITED FELLOWS I WONDER WHAT HE'S RUN ACROSS NOW WILL WAS ALMOST OUT OF BREATH THEY COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS RED FROM HIS EXERTIONS BUT FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS WELL WHILE HIS EYES WERE AS BLUFF EXPRESSED IT
7800-283492-0038 STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD OH WHAT A WHOPPER HE GASPED AS HE DREW NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED FRANK WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND SUCH TRE MENDOUS HORNS TOO CONTINUED WILL
7800-283492-0040 BUT I SNAPPED HIM BEFORE HE TURNED AND TROTTED OFF WHAT TROTTED OFF SHRILLED BLUFF
7800-283493-0000 THE BIG MOOSE A BULL MOOSE YOU SAY WILL ECHOED BLUFF HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN REPLIED THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BLUFF AND THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW A BULL MOOSE IF I SAW ONE
7800-283493-0002 I WAS SITTING AS STILL AS ANYTHING THE OTHER RELATED AFTER I'D GOT TWO DANDY SNAPS AT THAT FUNNY SQUIRREL FAMILY PLAYING AROUND THE TREE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR HOME AND WAS HOPING FOR ANOTHER WHACK AT THEM TO COMPLETE THE SET WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A WHIFFING SOUND
7800-283493-0003 BUT GO ON WILL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT OH I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD MADE THAT QUEER SOUND AND THERE HE WAS JUST STANDING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS NEARLY SCARED TO DEATH AT FIRST FOR HE LOOKED NEARLY AS BIG AS A BARN

7859-102518-0000 THE ROMAN AND THE PERSIAN EMPIRES DRAINED OF MEN AND MONEY AND RAVAGED FROM END TO END BY EACH OTHER'S MARAUDING ARMIES SANK DOWN IN EXHAUSTION TO HEAL THEM OF THEIR DEADLY WOUNDS
7859-102518-0002 HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE
7859-102518-0003 THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
7859-102518-0005 THE POLITICS OF ARABIA HAD UP TO THIS TIME BEEN OF LITTLE MOMENT EITHER TO ROMAN OR PERSIAN EACH OF THEM HAD ALLIES AMONG THE ARAB TRIBES AND HAD SOMETIMES SENT AN EXPEDITION OR AN EMBASSY SOUTHWARD
7859-102518-0006 INTO THE LAND BEYOND THE SYRIAN DESERT BUT NEITHER OF THEM DREAMED THAT THE SCATTERED AND DISUNITED TRIBES OF ARABIA WOULD EVER COMBINE OR BECOME A SERIOUS DANGER
7859-102518-0008 INTO NEW CHANNELS AND CHANGE THE FACE OF WHOLE CONTINENTS MAHOMET THAT STRANGEST OF MORAL ENIGMAS PROPHET AND SEER FANATIC AND IMPOSTOR WAS DEVELOPING HIS CAREER ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE PERSIAN WAR
7859-102518-0009 BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
7859-102518-0011 GOD WAS GOD AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET
7859-102518-0012 BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
7859-102518-0014 IS NOT A THING TO BE DESPISED
7859-102518-0015 NOR SCOFF WITH GIBBON AT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE TROOPS WHO WERE ROUTED BY THEM IF THE SOLDIERS OF QUEEN VICTORIA ARMED WITH MODERN RIFLES AND ARTILLERY FOUND THE FANATICAL ARAB A FORMIDABLE FOE LET US NOT BLAME THE SOLDIERS OF HERACLIUS WHO FACED THE SAME ENEMY
7859-102518-0017 WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
7859-102518-0018 THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
7859-102518-0020 SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION
7859-102518-0021 BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
7859-102518-0023 THE DETAILS OF THE ARAB CONQUEST OF SYRIA HAVE NOT BEEN PRESERVED BY THE EAST ROMAN HISTORIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE HATED THE IDEA OF RECORDING THE DISASTERS OF CHRISTENDOM THE MOSLEMS ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NOT YET COMMENCED TO WRITE AND ERE HISTORIANS AROSE AMONG THEM
7859-102518-0024 THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
7859-102518-0026 THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
7859-102518-0027 BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
7859-102518-0029 MOST OF ITS POPULATION WERE MASSACRED
7859-102518-0030 AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
7859-102518-0032 HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
7859-102518-0033 AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
7859-102519-0000 WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
7859-102519-0001 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0003 AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
7859-102519-0004 BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
7859-102519-0006 JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
7859-102519-0007 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
7859-102519-0009 STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
7859-102519-0010 WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
7859-102519-0012 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0018 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0021 AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
7859-102519-0022 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0024 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0025 THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102521-0000 THE ICONOCLASTS
7859-102521-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0003 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0006 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0007 SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
7859-102521-0009 THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
7859-102521-0010 WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
7859-102521-0012 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0013 SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
7859-102521-0015 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
8014-112586-0000 ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS FOR THE PUBLICATION OF THE ANCIENT LAWS OF IRELAND PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES IRELAND LONDON LONGMANS GREEN AND CO DUBLIN M H GILL AND SON
8014-112586-0001 NINETEEN O SEVEN PRINTED BY PONSONBY AND GIBBS UNIVERSITY PRESS DUBLIN PREFACE
8014-112586-0003 WHEN IT WAS WHOLLY GOVERNED BY NATIVE RULERS THE PUBLICATION COMES AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME WHEN THERE IS AN AWAKENING OF INTEREST IN THE IRISH LANGUAGE AND IN IRISH LORE OF EVERY KIND UNPARALLELED IN OUR HISTORY BUT THE BOOK HAS A FURTHER MISSION
8014-112586-0004 THERE ARE MANY ENGLISH AND MANY ANGLO IRISH PEOPLE WHO THINK MERELY FROM IGNORANCE THAT IRELAND WAS A BARBAROUS AND HALF SAVAGE COUNTRY BEFORE THE ENGLISH CAME AMONG THE PEOPLE AND CIVILISED THEM THIS BOOK SO FAR AS IT FINDS ITS WAY AMONG THE TWO CLASSES ABOVE MENTIONED WILL
8014-112586-0006 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0007 AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
8014-112586-0009 AND FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ALL OVER ENGLAND BY THE RAVAGES OF THE DANES BUT THERE WERE AND ARE ENGLISHMEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY
8014-112586-0010 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT ENGLISH POET EDMUND SPENSER LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN IRELAND AND MADE HIMSELF WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS HISTORY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN PAST AGES
8014-112586-0012 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
8014-112586-0013 THE FIRST A SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0015 THE SECOND A SMALLER SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0016 FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
8014-112586-0018 FOR ALL THE STATEMENTS IT CONTAINS FULL AND SATISFACTORY AUTHORITIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE TWO LARGER WORKS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE ALL THREE READABLE AND INTERESTING AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIVE
8014-112586-0019 THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
8014-112602-0000 AN OVAL FACE BROAD ABOVE AND NARROW BELOW GOLDEN HAIR FAIR SKIN WHITE DELICATE AND WELL FORMED HANDS WITH SLENDER TAPERING FINGERS THESE WERE CONSIDERED AS MARKING THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND OF HIGH FAMILY DESCENT
8014-112602-0001 THEY WERE THE MARKS OF ARISTOCRACY TO THESE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE ADDED BY THE USUAL ARTIFICIAL MEANS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FINGER NAILS WERE KEPT CAREFULLY CUT AND ROUNDED
8014-112602-0003 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0006 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0007 THE HAIR WAS COMBED DAILY AFTER A BATH THE HEROES OF THE FENA OF ERIN BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO THEIR DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING ALWAYS TOOK A BATH AND CAREFULLY COMBED THEIR LONG HAIR AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES IN VERY EARLY TIMES
8014-112602-0009 FLOWED DOWN HIS BACK AND WAS DONE UP IN
8014-112602-0010 HOOKS AND PLAITS AND SWORDLETS
8014-112602-0012 IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
8014-112602-0013 AND MUST HAVE OCCUPIED MUCH TIME WHETHER IN CASE OF MEN OR WOMEN
8014-112602-0015 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0016 AND GRADUALLY NARROWED TO TWO POINTS BELOW SOMETIMES AS SHOWN IN MANY ANCIENT FIGURES IT FALLS DOWN IN A SINGLE MASS WHILE IN A FEW IT IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT BOTTOM NOT UNLIKE ASSYRIAN BEARDS NEARLY ALL HAVE A MUSTACHE
8014-112602-0018 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0019 FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
8014-112602-0021 THE MODES OF MANUFACTURING THEM WILL BE MENTIONED SILK AND SATIN WHICH WERE OF COURSE IMPORTED WERE MUCH WORN AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FURS OF ANIMALS SUCH AS SEALS OTTERS BADGERS FOXES ET CETERA WERE MUCH USED FOR CAPES AND JACKETS
8014-112602-0022 AND FOR THE EDGINGS OF VARIOUS GARMENTS SO THAT SKINS OF ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS WERE VALUABLE THEY FORMED TOO AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVERYDAY TRAFFIC AND THEY WERE ALSO EXPORTED THE ANCIENT IRISH LOVED BRIGHT COLOURS

8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
8014-280382-0012 AND SWAM ACROSS TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THOUGH MANY JAVELINS OF THE ENEMY FELL ABOUT HIM HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT HURT NOR DID SUCH VALOR FAIL TO RECEIVE DUE HONOR FROM THE CITY
8051-118101-0000 IN ORDER TO ECONOMIZE TIME AND SPACE WITH A VIEW TO GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF AS MANY OF THE TRAVELERS AS POSSIBLE IT SEEMS EXPEDIENT WHERE A NUMBER OF ARRIVALS COME IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER TO REPORT THEM BRIEFLY UNDER ONE HEAD
8051-118101-0002 BEING FAR IN THE SOUTH AND IN THE HANDS OF A BRUTAL CAPTAIN OF A SMALL BOAT CHANCES OF FREEDOM OR OF MODERATE TREATMENT HAD RARELY EVER PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN ANY ASPECT
8051-118101-0003 THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO LIVE UNDER A TRADER WAS SO TERRIBLE HE WAS MOVED TO ESCAPE LEAVING HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE HAD ONLY BEEN MARRIED THREE MONTHS HENRY WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
8051-118101-0005 CHARLES AND HIS WIFE WERE FORTUNATE IN MANAGING TO FLEE TOGETHER THEIR ATTACHMENT TO EACH OTHER WAS EVIDENTLY TRUE THEY WERE BOTH OWNED BY A FARMER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF DAVID STEWART AND RESIDED IN MARYLAND
8051-118101-0006 AS HE HAD MORE OF THAT KIND OF STOCK THAN HE HAD USE FOR HE HIRED THEM OUT TO ANOTHER FARMER
8051-118101-0008 AROUSED HIM TO SEEK THEIR FREEDOM BY FLIGHT HE RESOLVED TO SPARE NO PAINS TO GIVE HIMSELF NO REST UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH FREE
8051-118101-0009 CHARLES WAS TWENTY EIGHT WITH A GOOD HEAD AND STRIKING FACE AS WELL AS OTHERWISE WELL MADE CHESTNUT COLOR AND INTELLIGENT THOUGH UNABLE TO READ LEFT TWO SISTERS IN BONDAGE
8051-118101-0011 THE ORDER OF THE DAY WAS LITERALLY AS FAR AS COLORED MEN WERE CONCERNED NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT CHASKEY BROWN WM HENRY WASHINGTON JAMES ALFRED FRISLEY
8051-118101-0012 AND CHARLES HENRY SALTER CHASKEY IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK MEDIUM SIZE SOUND BODY AND INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE NEVERTHELESS HE RESEMBLED A FARM HAND IN EVERY PARTICULAR
8051-118101-0014 THE MAJOR IN DISPOSITION WAS VERY ABUSIVE AND PROFANE THOUGH OLD AND GREY HEADED HIS WIFE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF A WOMAN AS HE WAS A MAN ONE WHO DELIGHTED IN MAKING THE SLAVES TREMBLE AT HER BIDDING
8051-118101-0015 CHASKEY WAS A MEMBER OF THE STILL POND CHURCH OF KENT COUNTY MARYLAND OFTEN CHASKEY WAS MADE TO FEEL THE LASH ON HIS BACK NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GOOD STANDING IN THE CHURCH HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD
8051-118101-0017 CHARLES HENRY IS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE OF GOOD PROPORTION NICE LOOKING AND INTELLIGENT BUT TO ROUGH USAGE HE WAS NO STRANGER TO SELECT HIS OWN MASTER WAS A PRIVILEGE NOT ALLOWED
8051-118101-0018 PRIVILEGES OF ALL KINDS WERE RARE WITH HIM SO HE RESOLVED TO FLEE LEFT HIS MOTHER THREE SISTERS AND FIVE BROTHERS IN SLAVERY HE WAS A MEMBER OF ALBANY CHAPEL AT MASSEY'S CROSS ROADS
8051-118101-0020 AND THEY WERE SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING TO CANADA STEPHEN TAYLOR CHARLES BROWN CHARLES HENRY HOLLIS AND LUTHER DORSEY STEPHEN WAS A FINE YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE FLED TO KEEP FROM BEING SOLD
8051-118101-0021 AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY BEFORE THIS WATCHFUL AND RESOLUTE PURPOSE THE WAY OPENED AND HE SOON FOUND IT COMPARATIVELY EASY TO FIND HIS WAY FROM MARYLAND TO PENNSYLVANIA AND LIKEWISE INTO THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
8051-118101-0023 BEING A YOUNG MAN OF PROMISE STEPHEN WAS ADVISED EARNESTLY TO APPLY HIS MIND TO SEEK AN EDUCATION AND TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE ENDEAVOR TO RAISE HIMSELF IN THE SCALE OF MANHOOD MORALLY RELIGIOUSLY AND INTELLECTUALLY
8051-118101-0024 AND HE SEEMED TO DRINK IN THE ADMONITIONS THUS GIVEN WITH A RELISH AFTER RECRUITING AND ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIS COMFORT AND PASSAGE TO CANADA HE WAS DULY FORWARDED
8051-118101-0026 THOUGH HIS STOUT AND HEARTY APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM VERY DESIRABLE TO A TRADER HE FLED FROM WILLIAM WHEELING OF SANDY HOOK MARYLAND HE SPOKE OF HIS MASTER AS A PRETTY BAD MAN WHO WAS ALWAYS QUARRELING AND WOULD DRINK SWEAR AND LIE
8051-118101-0027 LEFT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT ANYTHING FOR HIS LABOR
8051-118101-0029 AND IN MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH CANADA HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUFFER MANY THINGS SO THE FIRST CHANCE CHARLES GOT HE STARTED AND PROVIDENCE SMILED UPON HIS RESOLUTION
8051-118101-0030 TRUE THE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AND BROTHERS LEFT IN THE PRISON HOUSE LARGELY MARRED HIS JOY AS IT DID ALSO THE COMMITTEE'S STILL THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT CHARLES HAD GAINED HIS FREEDOM HONORABLY
8051-118101-0032 AND THIS WAS WHAT MADE CHARLES UNHAPPY UNEDUCATED AS HE WAS HE WAS TOO SENSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WEBSTER HAD ANY GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO HIS MANHOOD CONSEQUENTLY HE LEFT BECAUSE HIS MASTER DID NOT TREAT HIM RIGHT
8051-118101-0033 WEBSTER WAS A TALL MAN WITH LARGE BLACK WHISKERS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
8051-118101-0035 RATHER SMART BLACK WELL MADE AND WELL CALCULATED FOR A CANADIAN HE WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE PURELY FROM THE DESIRE TO BE FREE HE FLED FROM A VERY INSULTING MAN BY THE NAME OF EDWARD SCHRINER FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAIRSVILLE MILLS
8051-118101-0036 THIS SCHRINER WAS DESCRIBED AS A LOW CHUNKY MAN WITH GRUM LOOK BIG MOUTH ET CETERA AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN REFORMED CHURCH DON'T SWEAR THOUGH MIGHT AS WELL HE WAS SO BAD OTHER WAYS
8051-119902-0000 CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
8051-119902-0001 AT ANOTHER OATEN CAKE AND AT ANOTHER CORN PONE BREAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHATEVER CEREAL HAPPENED TO BE CONVENIENT EVEN SUCH UNBREADLIKE FOOD AS RICE IS TO SOME RACES WHAT BREAD IS TO US
8051-119902-0003 TO UNDERSTAND WHY MAKE A DOUGH WITH A LITTLE WHITE FLOUR AND WATER AND THEN GENTLY KNEAD IT IN COLD WATER THE CONSISTENCY CHANGES THE STARCH IS WASHED OUT AND A RUBBERY STICKY BALL IS LEFT
8051-119902-0004 THE GLUTEN WHICH IS THE PROTEIN OF THE WHEAT IT IS THIS GLUTEN IN THE FLOUR THAT STRETCHES WHEN BREAD RISES AND THEN STIFFENS WHEN IT IS BAKED MAKING A LIGHT POROUS LOAF
8051-119902-0006 PRODUCTS RAISED WITH BAKING POWDER FOR WHICH OUR STANDARD OF LIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT QUICK BREADS LIKE BISCUITS AND MUFFINS AND CAKES DO NOT REQUIRE THE GLUTEN AND CAN EASILY BE MADE FROM SUBSTITUTE CEREALS
8051-119902-0007 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PRODUCE A WHEATLESS LOAF WHICH IS LIGHT PALATABLE AND SUFFICIENTLY DURABLE TO STAND TRANSPORTATION THE DURABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION CRUMBLY CORN BREAD CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED BY BAKERS NOR SERVED TO ARMIES
8051-119902-0009 ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
8051-119902-0010 AND MANY HOTELS CLUBS AND INSTITUTIONS ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THE BREAD IN THE UNITED STATES IS MADE IN BAKERIES AND THREE FIFTHS IN THE HOME THE BAKERIES HAVE USED THIRTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS OF FLOUR EACH YEAR
8051-119902-0012 TWENTY PER CENT WAS REQUIRED AND LATER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN PIES AND CAKES THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE THIRD SUBSTITUTE THE AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND FAT USED ARE LIMITED
8051-119902-0013 EVEN THE SIZES OF THE LOAVES ARE FIXED SO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF MAKING AND HANDLING ALL SORTS OF FANCY SHAPES AND SIZES MAY BE AVOIDED BREAD MUST NOT BE SOLD TO THE RETAILER AT UNREASONABLE PRICES
8051-119902-0015 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0016 HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE OR SERVE BREAD CONTAINING AT LEAST AS MUCH OF THE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES AS VICTORY BREAD THEY MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO OUNCES OF BREAD AND OTHER WHEAT PRODUCTS TO A GUEST AT A MEAL
8051-119902-0018 UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
8051-119902-0019 AND YOU NEED NO BREAD AT ALL AT SOME MEALS AN EXTRA POTATO OR A SERVING OF RICE CAN BE EATEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TWO SLICES OF BREAD AND THE BODY WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY DO NOT BE THE SLAVE OF OLD FOOD HABITS
8051-119902-0021 HUNDREDS IN CROWDED CITY QUARTERS HAVE NO FACILITIES OF THEIR OWN FOR BAKING WOMEN DOING THEIR SHARE IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS CANNOT GET UP EARLIER TO MAKE CORN BREAD FOR BREAKFAST VICTORY BREAD MUST BE SAVED FOR THEM
8051-119902-0022 FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHICH MUST USE WHEAT
8051-119902-0024 THE INTERESTS AND DESIRES OF EACH OF US IN THIS WAR CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO SERVICE IN NO MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAN BY CONFORMING OUR FOOD HABITS TO THE NEEDS OF THE HOUR FLOUR AND BREAD IN THE ALLIED COUNTRIES
8051-119902-0025 IN ENGLAND THERE ARE LOCAL REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF MASHED POTATO IN BREAD THEIR BREAD MUST BE TWELVE HOURS OLD BEFORE IT IS SOLD SO THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO EAT TOO MUCH THE RESULT IS SELDOM PALATABLE
8051-119902-0027 MUST CONTAIN FORTY THREE PER CENT SUBSTITUTE AND IN SOME PLACES MAY NOT BE MANUFACTURED AT ALL BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAVE SUBSIDIZED BREAD THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET A PRICE BELOW COST
8051-119902-0028 AND ITSELF MAKES UP THE DIFFERENCE TO THE BAKER ENGLAND HAS APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSE BREAD RATIONS ARE IN FORCE IN BOTH FRANCE AND ITALY
8051-119902-0030 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8051-119902-0031 THE VOLUNTARY RATION ALLOWS ONE HALF POUND OF BREAD A DAY FOR SEDENTARY AND UNOCCUPIED WOMEN AND LARGER ALLOWANCES UP TO A LITTLE OVER A POUND FOR MEN DOING HEAVY LABOR
8051-119902-0033 THE ANSWERS ARE MANY IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ARE SENDING CORN OVER OUR EXPORTS OF CORN DURING MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INCREASED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT AND OF CORN MEAL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PER CENT
8051-119902-0034 OVER THE PRE WAR AVERAGE THIS THEY ARE USING AS WE ARE USING IT IN OUR VICTORY BREAD BUT THEY MUST HAVE ENOUGH WHEAT TO MAKE A DURABLE LOAF OF BREAD AT THE BAKESHOPS WHERE FOR GENERATIONS ALL THE BAKING HAS BEEN DONE
8051-119902-0036 BY THE FAILURE OF A NEIGHBOR TO CONSERVE WHEAT HAVE ASKED WHY THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TRUSTS TO VOLUNTARY METHODS WHY IT DOES NOT RATION THE COUNTRY RATIONING MAY COME YET BUT ANY SUCH SYSTEM BRISTLES WITH DIFFICULTIES
8051-119902-0037 THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
8051-295385-0000 AND HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE CHAPTER ONE HITHERTO MOST VENERABLE AND COURTEOUS READER HAVE I SHOWN THEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VALOROUS STUYVESANT UNDER THE MILD MOONSHINE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0001 OR RATHER THE GRIM TRANQUILLITY OF AWFUL EXPECTATION BUT NOW THE WAR DRUM RUMBLES FROM AFAR THE BRAZEN TRUMPET BRAYS ITS THRILLING NOTE
8051-295385-0003 NOR THROUGH THE LIVELONG LAZY SUMMER'S DAY CHANTS FORTH HIS LOVE SICK SOUL IN MADRIGALS TO MANHOOD ROUSED HE SPURNS THE AMOROUS FLUTE DOFFS FROM HIS BRAWNY BACK THE ROBE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0004 AND CLOTHES HIS PAMPERED LIMBS IN PANOPLY OF STEEL O'ER HIS DARK BROW WHERE LATE THE MYRTLE WAVED WHERE WANTON ROSES BREATHED ENERVATE LOVE HE REARS THE BEAMING CASQUE AND NODDING PLUME GRASPS THE BRIGHT SHIELD
8051-295385-0006 EQUIPPING OUR WARRIORS WITH BUCKLERS HELMS AND LANCES AND SUCH LIKE OUTLANDISH AND OBSOLETE WEAPONS THE LIKE OF WHICH PERCHANCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN THE SAME MANNER THAT A CUNNING STATUARY ARRAYS A MODERN GENERAL OR AN ADMIRAL
8051-295385-0007 IN THE ACCOUTREMENTS OF A CAESAR OR AN ALEXANDER THE SIMPLE TRUTH THEN OF ALL THIS ORATORICAL FLOURISH IS THIS THAT THE VALIANT PETER STUYVESANT ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUND IT NECESSARY
8051-295385-0009 WHICH STILL HANGS IN THE FAMILY MANSION OF THE STUYVESANTS ARRAYED IN ALL THE TERRORS OF A TRUE DUTCH GENERAL HIS REGIMENTAL COAT OF GERMAN BLUE GORGEOUSLY DECORATED WITH A GOODLY SHOW OF LARGE BRASS BUTTONS
8051-295385-0010 REACHING FROM HIS WAISTBAND TO HIS CHIN THE VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS TURNED UP AT THE CORNERS AND SEPARATING GALLANTLY BEHIND SO AS TO DISPLAY THE SEAT OF A SUMPTUOUS PAIR OF BRIMSTONE COLORED TRUNK BREECHES
8051-295385-0012 STUCK WITH A GALLANT AND FIERY AIR OVER HIS LEFT EYE SUCH WAS THE CHIVALRIC PORT OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG AND WHEN HE MADE A SUDDEN HALT PLANTED HIMSELF FIRMLY ON HIS SOLID SUPPORTER
8051-295385-0013 WITH HIS WOODEN LEG INLAID WITH SILVER A LITTLE IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING A GOLD HEADED CANE HIS LEFT RESTING UPON THE PUMMEL OF HIS SWORD HIS HEAD DRESSING SPIRITEDLY TO THE RIGHT
8051-295385-0015 PROCEED WE NOW TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE OF THIS WARLIKE PREPARATION IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE FOUNDING OF FORT CASIMIR AND OF THE MERCILESS WARFARE WAGED BY ITS COMMANDER
8051-295385-0016 UPON CABBAGES SUNFLOWERS AND PUMPKINS FOR WANT OF BETTER OCCASION TO FLESH HIS SWORD NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HIGHER UP THE DELAWARE AT HIS STRONGHOLD OF TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0018 DESCRIBES HIM AS WEIGHING UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS A HUGE FEEDER AND BOUSER IN PROPORTION TAKING THREE POTATIONS POTTLE DEEP AT EVERY MEAL HE HAD A GARRISON AFTER HIS OWN HEART AT TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0019 GUZZLING DEEP DRINKING SWASHBUCKLERS WHO MADE THE WILD WOODS RING WITH THEIR CAROUSALS NO SOONER DID THIS ROBUSTIOUS COMMANDER HEAR OF THE ERECTION OF FORT CASIMIR THAN HE SENT A MESSAGE TO VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0021 FROM THE MANHATTOES AS WITNESS THE BREECHES OF THEIR LAND MEASURER TEN BROECK TO THIS THE GOVERNOR REJOINED THAT THE LAND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLD BY THE INDIANS TO THE SWEDES AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS UNDER THE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT
8051-295385-0022 OF HER SWEDISH MAJESTY CHRISTINA AND WOE BE TO ANY MORTAL THAT WORE A BREECHES WHO SHOULD DARE TO MEDDLE EVEN WITH THE HEM OF HER SACRED GARMENT
8051-295385-0024 GOVERNOR PRINTZ FINDING HE WAS NOT TO BE DISLODGED BY THESE LONG SHOTS NOW DETERMINED UPON COMING TO CLOSER QUARTERS ACCORDINGLY HE DESCENDED THE RIVER IN GREAT FORCE AND FUME AND ERECTED A RIVAL FORTRESS
8051-295385-0025 JUST ONE SWEDISH MILE BELOW FORT CASIMIR TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAME OF HELSENBURG AND NOW COMMENCED A TREMENDOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN THESE TWO DOUGHTY COMMANDERS STRIVING TO OUTSTRUT AND OUTSWELL EACH OTHER
8051-295385-0027 AND WHICHEVER HAD THE WIND IN ITS FAVOR WOULD KEEP UP A CONTINUAL FIRING OF CANNON TO TAUNT ITS ANTAGONIST WITH THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON ALL THESE POINTS OF WINDY WARFARE THE ANTAGONISTS WERE WELL MATCHED
8051-295385-0028 BUT SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE SWEDISH FORTRESS BEING LOWER DOWN THE RIVER ALL THE DUTCH VESSELS BOUND TO FORT CASIMIR WITH SUPPLIES HAD TO PASS IT
8051-295385-0030 AND SORELY WOULD HE SWELL WHEN FROM THE RAMPARTS OF FORT CASIMIR HE BEHELD THE FLAG OF THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES STRUCK TO THE RIVAL FORTRESS TO HEIGHTEN HIS VEXATION GOVERNOR PRINTZ WHO AS HAS BEEN SHOWN WAS A HUGE TRENCHERMAN
8051-295385-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE PAID TO THE DUTCH SKIPPERS THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR COMMODITIES BUT WHAT CONSOLATION WAS THIS TO JACOBUS VAN POFFENBURGH AND HIS GARRISON WHO THUS FOUND THEIR FAVORITE SUPPLIES CUT OFF
8051-295385-0033 DAILY FAILING THEM AT LENGTH THE SUMMER HEATS AND SUMMER SHOWERS SET IN AND NOW LO AND BEHOLD A GREAT MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE NEDERLANDS
8051-295385-0034 FOR IT CAME TO PASS THAT A GREAT CLOUD OF MOSQUITOS AROSE OUT OF THE MARSHY BORDERS OF THE RIVER AND SETTLED UPON THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG BEING DOUBTLESS ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE FRESH BLOOD OF THE SWEDISH GORMANDISERS
8051-295385-0036 WAS SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE MOSQUITO FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME THE GARRISON ENDEAVORED TO HOLD OUT BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN THE MOSQUITOS PENETRATED INTO EVERY CHINK AND CREVICE AND GAVE THEM NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT
8051-295385-0037 SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES
8063-274112-0000 AND EXCEEDINGLY UNHAPPY IN FACT D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WE SAY FOR WE MUST CALL HIM BY HIS NAME TO REMIND OUR READERS OF HIS EXISTENCE D'ARTAGNAN WE REPEAT
8063-274112-0001 HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO AMIDST THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES OF FASHION AFTER FOLLOWING THE KING DURING TWO WHOLE DAYS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0003 WHY I THINK YOU ARE QUITE AS WELL DRESSED AS THE
8063-274112-0004 IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
8063-274112-0006 AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
8063-274112-0007 QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM DANCING YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN INQUIRED THE KING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
8063-274112-0009 AH IF I COULD ONLY HOLD THE BALANCING POLE WHILE YOU WERE DANCING IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID THE KING GRAVELY PEOPLE DANCE WITHOUT BALANCING POLES
8063-274112-0010 AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
8063-274112-0012 AND THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW OPEN AND THAT ONE BELONGING TO A ROOM
8063-274112-0013 A PERFUME OF SPICES MINGLED WITH ANOTHER PERFUME LESS EXOTIC BUT MORE PENETRATING NAMELY THAT WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET ASCENDED TO SALUTE THE NOSTRILS OF THE MUSKETEER D'ARTAGNAN RECLINING IN AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS NOT STRETCHED OUT
8063-274112-0015 USUALLY SO QUICK AND INTELLIGENT IN THEIR EXPRESSION WERE NOW HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED FASTENED AS IT WERE UPON A SMALL CORNER OF BLUE SKY THAT WAS VISIBLE BEHIND THE OPENING OF THE CHIMNEYS
8063-274112-0016 THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH BLUE AND NO MORE TO FILL ONE OF THE SACKS OF LENTILS OR HARICOTS WHICH FORMED THE PRINCIPAL FURNITURE OF THE SHOP ON THE GROUND FLOOR THUS EXTENDED AT HIS EASE AND SHELTERED IN HIS PLACE OF OBSERVATION BEHIND THE WINDOW D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0018 WHILE THE WINDOWS OF THE UPPER APARTMENTS WERE BEING CLOSED AND THE RHYTHMIC STEPS OF A PATROL OF SOLDIERS FORMING THE NIGHT WATCH COULD BE HEARD RETREATING D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED HOWEVER TO THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT THE BLUE CORNER OF THE SKY A FEW PACES FROM HIM
8063-274112-0019 AND HIS EYES FIXED ON D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS EITHER THINKING DREAMING OR SLEEPING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
8063-274112-0021 AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
8063-274112-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOISE PRODUCED BY PLANCHET'S FALL D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE HEARD MANY OTHER AND VERY DIFFERENT FALLS DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT ONE BESIDES
8063-274112-0024 I AM IN DESPAIR SAID PLANCHET TO HEAR SUCH A WORD AS EVEN WELL
8063-274112-0025 OF COURSE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WELL WELL THEN THE WORD DISTRESSES ME BEYOND MEASURE TELL ME WHY YOU ARE DISTRESSED PLANCHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN ASLEEP
8063-274112-0027 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
8063-274112-0028 WHEN YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE BOTH WERE THERE A CERTAIN ARAB
8063-274112-0030 AS I AM RESTING MYSELF NOW AND SMOKED I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF MAGICAL LEAVES IN A LARGE AMBER MOUTHED TUBE
8063-274112-0031 BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP TO LIE DOWN THAN TO SIT DOWN TO BE DEAD THAN TO LIE DOWN HE WAS AN ACUTELY MELANCHOLY ARAB AND I REMEMBER HIM PERFECTLY WELL
8063-274112-0033 HE LOOKED LIKE A BASKET MAKER MAKING BASKETS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT PLANCHET HE DID
8063-274112-0034 I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MODE OF REASONING
8063-274112-0036 IT IS IN MY OPINION VERY ABSURD MY OWN UNDOUBTED PREFERENCE BEING FOR MY BED AND IF YOU ARE NOT OF MY OPINION IT IS SIMPLY AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH PLANCHET
8063-274112-0037 EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN
8063-274112-0039 AND YET MONSIEUR YOU HAVE A LOOK OUT UPON THE STREET YES AND WONDERFULLY INTERESTING THAT IS OF COURSE BUT IT IS NO LESS TRUE MONSIEUR THAT
8063-274112-0040 AH PLANCHET MY FRIEND RETURNED D'ARTAGNAN YOU ARE GETTING AMBITIOUS
8063-274115-0001 FOR THE MORROW BUT THE GROCER HAD A HEART OF GOLD EVER MINDFUL OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES A TRAIT THAT CARRIES YOUTH INTO OLD AGE SO PLANCHET NOTWITHSTANDING A SORT OF INTERNAL SHIVER CHECKED AS SOON AS EXPERIENCED

8088-284756-0010 MERCER PICKED THE PLACE UP FOR ME AT A SONG THE MONSTROSITY WAS SOME FOUR MILES FURTHER OUT FROM TOWN AND OFF THE HIGHWAY PERHAPS A HALF MILE MORE
8088-284756-0011 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0013 A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
8088-284756-0014 APPARENTLY EVERY BULB IN THE PLACE WAS BURNING JUST A FEW YARDS BEYOND THE SURF BOOMED HOLLOWLY ON THE SMOOTH SHADY SHORE LITTERED NOW I KNEW BY THE PITIFUL SPOILS OF THE STORM

8088-284756-0020 HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
8088-284756-0022 THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
8088-284756-0023 YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE TRIP WAS WORTH WHILE HERE SHE IS WITH A GESTURE HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND I STARED FOLLOWING HIS GLANCE DOWN AT THE GREAT TILED SWIMMING POOL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE
8088-284756-0025 WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
8088-284756-0026 WE WERE STANDING AT ONE SIDE OF THE POOL NEAR THE CENTER DIRECTLY OPPOSITE US SEATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL WAS A HUMAN FIGURE NUDE SAVE FOR A GREAT MASS OF TAWNY HAIR THAT FELL ABOUT HER LIKE A SILKEN MANTLE
8088-284756-0028 PORCELAIN I ASKED HOARSELY THE THING HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY EERY EFFECT HE LAUGHED WILDLY PORCELAIN WATCH LOOK MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
8088-284756-0029 THE GREAT CLOUD OF CORN COLORED HAIR FLOATED DOWN ABOUT IT FALLING BELOW THE KNEES SLOWLY WITH A GRACE OF MOVEMENT COMPARABLE ONLY WITH THE SLOW SOARING OF A GULL SHE CAME TOWARD ME WALKING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER AS THOUGH SHE FLOATED IN AIR
8088-284756-0031 I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
8088-284756-0032 HE LAUGHED AN EXCITED HIGH PITCHED LAUGH THAT IRRITATED ME IN SOME SUBTLE WAY SHE WAS SMILING AND LOOKING UP INTO MY EYES SHE WAS VERY CLOSE NOW WITHIN A FEW FEET OF US
8088-284756-0034 HE ASKED HIS DARK EYES DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT TELL ME ABOUT IT I SAID SHAKING MY HEAD DAZEDLY SHE IS NOT HUMAN I DON'T KNOW I THINK SO AS HUMAN AS YOU OR I I'LL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
8088-284756-0035 I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
8088-284756-0037 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0038 THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
8088-284756-0040 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT

8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER

8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0052 IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0058 NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0022 WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023 ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0025 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026 THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0028 AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029 SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0001 THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0004 THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0007 THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0010 WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0013 WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0016 THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020 BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0022 HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0025 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026 COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0028 BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0031 THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032 SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0034 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0037 NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038 BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041 THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0043 THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0046 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0049 HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050 SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0052 WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0055 TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274348-0000 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001 HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0006 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0009 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0012 AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013 THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0015 AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL

8098-278252-0023 CANNON BOOMED STEAM WHISTLES SHRIEKED AND THE CITIZENS SHOUTED AND HURRAHED AND I WAS GLAD MAC WAS NOT WITH ME TO ADD HIS SALUTE
8098-278252-0024 I SAW A MEADOW LARK ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THIS DAY I HEARD BLUE BIRDS AND ROBINS SINGING GAILY IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SPRING HAD COME TO STAY I EXPECTED THAT DAY TO REACH DALTON ONLY EIGHT MILES DISTANT
8098-278252-0026 A STORE LOOMED INTO VIEW SHORTLY I WAS ELATED ACCORDING TO THE SIGN OVER THE ENTRANCE THE YOUNGER GENERATION WAS THE RULING POWER IT READ HEZEKIAH BRIMLEY AND FATHER
8098-278252-0027 I MADE FOR HEZ HE SAID THE TOWN HADN'T REACHED THE HOTEL STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT YET BUT THAT HE WOULD GLADLY TAKE ME IN PROVIDED I'D SLEEP WITH HIS CLERK IN THE GARRET
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS
8098-278252-0030 AND FELT BOOTS ENCASED IN HEAVY OVERSHOES THESE RURAL MEN EYED ME WITH SUSPICION UNTIL I MENTIONED MAC A'RONY THEN THERE WAS A RUSH TO THE DOOR AS IT SWUNG OPEN IN LEAPED MY GREAT DOG
8098-278252-0032 AND ONLY THIS MORNING ATE TWO CHICKENS AND A DUCK AND CHASED A FARMER INTO HIS HAY LOFT BUT HE DOESN'T BITE MY STATEMENT HAD A SENSATIONAL EFFECT ON THE ASSEMBLY WHO ONE BY ONE SNEAKED OUT OF THE DOOR
8098-278252-0033 LEAVING HEZ AND HIS ODD GUEST ALONE AS SOON AS THE JUNIOR MEMBER HEZ'S FATHER CAME IN HEZ TOOK MY ANIMALS TO THE SHED AND FED THEM AND TOLD ME TO HELP MYSELF TO THE BEST IN THE STORE
8098-278252-0035 TO BE GOOD CHOCOLATE MUST BE WELL DISSOLVED NO POT WAS TO BE HAD SAVE A FLOWER POT WITH A HOLE IN THE BOTTOM A GREAT IDEA POPPED INTO MY HEAD
8098-278252-0036 DID YOU EVER TRY IT IF NOT DON'T LET YOUR CURIOSITY GET THE BETTER OF YOU CHOCOLATE BELONGS TO THE BEAN FAMILY AND THE BEAN IS A VERY TREACHEROUS THING
8098-278252-0038 THAT MIXTURE MIGHT SUIT MY STOMACH I THOUGHT BUT IT DOESN'T DELIGHT MY PALATE I FELT I HAD EATEN A HEAVY MEAL UNWITTINGLY AND SAT DOWN TO DIGEST IT I HADN'T SAT LONG BEFORE I FELT MYSELF SWELLING
8098-278252-0039 SOMETHING WITHIN WAS SIZZLING AND BREWING AND STEAMING GAS AND STEAM CHOKED ME I WAS SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOR THAT I HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR THE YEAST CAKE CAME TO MIND THEN I KNEW THE CAUSE
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
8108-274318-0001 IT CAME ABOUT WITH SUCH UNCANNY SWIFTNESS AND TERROR THE LIGHT WAS SO UNCERTAIN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BLACK CAT SO DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ON THE DARK CARPET AND THE DOCTOR HIMSELF SO WEARY AND TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT HE FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
8108-274318-0002 TO OBSERVE ACCURATELY OR TO RECALL AFTERWARDS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS HE HAD SEEN OR IN WHAT ORDER THE INCIDENTS HAD TAKEN PLACE HE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT DEFECT OF VISION ON HIS PART MADE IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE CAT HAD DUPLICATED ITSELF AT FIRST
8108-274318-0004 WITH BRILLIANT GREEN EYES FLASHING FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS LIKE THE REFLECTIONS FROM A SCORE OF MIRRORS PLACED ROUND THE WALLS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES NOR COULD HE MAKE OUT AT THE TIME WHY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED
8108-274318-0005 THE SNARLING OF THE ENRAGED AND TERRIFIED COLLIE SOUNDED SOMETIMES SO FAR AWAY THE CEILING SEEMED TO HAVE RAISED ITSELF SO MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE AND MUCH OF THE FURNITURE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND SHIFTED MARVELLOUSLY IT WAS ALL SO CONFUSED AND CONFUSING
8108-274318-0007 UPON THE PROCEEDINGS OF SMOKE AND THE COLLIE THAT HE ONLY OBSERVED THEM AS IT WERE SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND THE EXCITEMENT THE FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT THE DISTRESS HE FELT FOR THE COLLIE
8108-274318-0008 WERE THE POOREST POSSIBLE ALLIES TO CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THE DOG WAS REPEATING HIS SHORT DANGEROUS BARK FROM TIME TO TIME SNAPPING VICIOUSLY AT THE EMPTY AIR A FOOT OR SO FROM THE GROUND ONCE INDEED
8108-274318-0010 AS THOUGH TO SPRING AGAIN SNARLING HORRIBLY AND MAKING SHORT HALF CIRCLES WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SMOKE ALL THE WHILE MEOWED PITEOUSLY BY THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TRYING TO DRAW THE ATTACK UPON HIMSELF THEN IT WAS THAT THE RUSH OF THE WHOLE DREADFUL BUSINESS
8108-274318-0011 SEEMED TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE DOG AND DIRECT ITSELF UPON HIS OWN PERSON THE COLLIE HAD MADE ANOTHER SPRING AND FALLEN BACK WITH A CRASH INTO THE CORNER WHERE HE MADE NOISE ENOUGH IN HIS SAVAGE RAGE TO WAKEN THE DEAD BEFORE HE FELL TO WHINING
8108-274318-0013 WALLS ANIMALS AND FIRE IN A MIST OF DARKNESS AND FOLDING ALSO ABOUT HIS OWN MIND OTHER FORMS MOVED SILENTLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VISION FORMS THAT HE RECOGNISED FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND WELCOMED NOT
8108-274318-0014 UNHOLY THOUGHTS BEGAN TO CROWD INTO HIS BRAIN SINISTER SUGGESTIONS OF EVIL PRESENTED THEMSELVES SEDUCTIVELY ICE SEEMED TO SETTLE ABOUT HIS HEART AND HIS MIND TREMBLED HE BEGAN TO LOSE MEMORY
8108-274318-0016 AND IT WAS THEN THAT THE ROOM FILLED WITH THIS HORDE OF CATS ALL DARK AS THE NIGHT ALL SILENT ALL WITH LAMPING EYES OF GREEN FIRE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PLACE ALTERED AND SHIFTED HE WAS IN A MUCH LARGER SPACE
8108-274318-0017 THE WHINING OF THE DOG SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND ALL ABOUT HIM THE CATS FLEW BUSILY TO AND FRO SILENTLY PLAYING THEIR TEARING RUSHING GAME OF EVIL WEAVING THE PATTERN OF THEIR DARK PURPOSE UPON THE FLOOR
8108-274318-0019 A MIST LAY OVER HIS MIND AND MEMORY HE FELT DAZED AND HIS FORCES SCATTERED THE DEEPS WITHIN WERE TOO TROUBLED FOR HEALING POWER TO COME OUT OF THEM IT WAS GLAMOUR OF COURSE HE REALISED AFTERWARDS
8108-274318-0020 THE STRONG GLAMOUR THROWN UPON HIS IMAGINATION BY SOME POWERFUL PERSONALITY BEHIND THE VEIL BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF THIS AND AS WITH ALL TRUE GLAMOUR WAS UNABLE TO GRASP
8108-274318-0022 SOMETHING FROM THE REGION OF UTTER COLD WAS UPON HIM AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THROUGH THE CONFUSED MISTS ABOUT HIM THERE SLOWLY ROSE UP THE PERSONALITY THAT HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME DIRECTING THE BATTLE SOME FORCE ENTERED HIS BEING
8108-274318-0023 THAT SHOOK HIM AS THE TEMPEST SHAKES A LEAF AND CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES CLEAN LEVEL WITH HIS FACE HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING INTO THE WRECK OF A VAST DARK COUNTENANCE A COUNTENANCE THAT WAS TERRIBLE EVEN IN ITS RUIN
8108-274318-0025 HE NEVER COULD PROPERLY MEASURE OR DETERMINE THESE TWO A MAN AND A WOMAN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S VISAGES AND DOWN INTO EACH OTHER'S HEARTS AND JOHN SILENCE THE SOUL WITH THE GOOD UNSELFISH MOTIVE
8108-274318-0026 HELD HIS OWN AGAINST THE DARK DISCARNATE WOMAN WHOSE MOTIVE WAS PURE EVIL AND WHOSE SOUL WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE DARK POWERS IT WAS THE CLIMAX THAT TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF POWER WITHIN HIM AND BEGAN TO RESTORE HIM SLOWLY TO HIS OWN
8108-274318-0028 THE INNER FORCES STIRRED AND TREMBLED IN RESPONSE TO HIS CALL THEY DID NOT AT FIRST COME READILY AS WAS THEIR HABIT FOR UNDER THE SPELL OF GLAMOUR THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DIABOLICALLY LULLED INTO INACTIVITY BUT COME THEY EVENTUALLY DID
8108-274318-0029 AND POWER AND CONFIDENCE CAME WITH THEM HE BEGAN TO BREATHE DEEPLY AND REGULARLY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSORB INTO HIMSELF THE FORCES OPPOSED TO HIM AND TO TURN THEM TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
8108-274318-0031 ULTIMATELY IS EVERYWHERE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS THE MOTIVE BEHIND THAT MAKES IT GOOD OR EVIL AND HIS MOTIVE WAS ENTIRELY UNSELFISH HE KNEW PROVIDED HE WAS NOT FIRST ROBBED OF SELF CONTROL
8108-274318-0032 HOW VICARIOUSLY TO ABSORB THESE EVIL RADIATIONS INTO HIMSELF AND CHANGE THEM MAGICALLY INTO HIS OWN GOOD PURPOSES AND SINCE HIS MOTIVE WAS PURE AND HIS SOUL FEARLESS THEY COULD NOT WORK HIM HARM
8108-274318-0034 AND THEREFORE OF POWER AND AS HIS SELF CONTROL RETURNED TO HIM HE GRADUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THIS PURPOSE EVEN THOUGH TREMBLING WHILE HE DID SO YET THE STRUGGLE WAS SEVERE AND IN SPITE OF THE FREEZING CHILL OF THE AIR
8108-274318-0035 THE PERSPIRATION POURED DOWN HIS FACE THEN BY SLOW DEGREES THE DARK AND DREADFUL COUNTENANCE FADED THE GLAMOUR PASSED FROM HIS SOUL THE NORMAL PROPORTIONS RETURNED TO WALLS AND CEILING THE FORMS MELTED BACK INTO THE FOG
8108-274318-0037 HE MADE CERTAIN SIGILS GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE CONTINUED TO UTTER THESE WORDS UNTIL AT LENGTH THE GROWING VOLUME DOMINATED THE WHOLE ROOM AND MASTERED THE MANIFESTATION OF ALL THAT OPPOSED IT
8108-274318-0038 FOR JUST AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY THAT CAN TRANSMUTE EVIL FORCES BY RAISING THEM INTO HIGHER CHANNELS SO HE KNEW FROM LONG STUDY THE OCCULT USE OF SOUND AND ITS DIRECT EFFECT UPON THE PLASTIC REGION
8108-274318-0040 FLAME BEGAN SUDDENLY UTTERING SOUNDS OF PLEASURE THAT SOMETHING BETWEEN A GROWL AND A GRUNT THAT DOGS MAKE UPON BEING RESTORED TO THEIR MASTER'S CONFIDENCE DOCTOR SILENCE HEARD THE THUMPING OF THE COLLIE'S TAIL AGAINST THE FLOOR AND THE GRUNT
8108-274318-0041 AND THE THUMPING TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF AFFECTION IN THE MAN'S HEART AND GAVE HIM SOME INKLING OF WHAT AGONIES THE DUMB CREATURE HAD SUFFERED NEXT FROM THE SHADOWS BY THE WINDOW A SOMEWHAT SHRILL PURRING ANNOUNCED THE RESTORATION OF THE CAT TO ITS NORMAL STATE
8108-274318-0043 CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
8108-274318-0044 AND PAWED HIS KNEES AND STARED BESEECHINGLY UP INTO HIS FACE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE COLLIE STILL LAY THUMPING HIS TAIL FEEBLY AND PATHETICALLY JOHN SILENCE UNDERSTOOD HE BENT DOWN AND STROKED THE CREATURE'S LIVING FUR
8108-274318-0046 AND UTTERING LITTLE SOFT SOUNDS OF AFFECTION IN HIS THROAT THE DOCTOR LIT THE CANDLE AND BROUGHT IT OVER HE SAW THE COLLIE LYING ON ITS SIDE AGAINST THE WALL IT WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AND FOAM STILL HUNG ABOUT ITS JAWS ITS TAIL AND EYES RESPONDED TO THE SOUND OF ITS NAME
8108-274318-0047 BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY VERY WEAK AND OVERCOME SMOKE CONTINUED TO RUB AGAINST ITS CHEEK AND NOSE AND EYES SOMETIMES EVEN STANDING ON ITS BODY AND KNEADING INTO THE THICK YELLOW HAIR FLAME REPLIED FROM TIME TO TIME BY LITTLE LICKS OF THE TONGUE
8108-280354-0000 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0003 AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
8108-280354-0004 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0006 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0007 IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
8108-280354-0009 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS
8108-280354-0010 GREAT LORDS OF THE WORLD BELOW THE EARTH TO WHICH ALL WE MORTALS MUST ONE DAY COME GRANT ME TO TELL A SIMPLE TALE
8108-280354-0012 SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
8108-280354-0013 AND SHE CAME YET HALTING FROM HER RECENT WOUND TAKE HER SAYS PLUTO AND LEAD HER BACK TO THE LIGHT
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0016 AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
8108-280354-0018 HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
8108-280354-0019 THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
8108-280354-0021 ONE DAY HE SAT DOWN TO REST ON A GRASSY HILL IN THE SUNSHINE AND PLAYED AND SANG TO BEGUILE HIS SORROW AS HE PLAYED THE COOLNESS OF SHADY BRANCHES SEEMED ALL ABOUT HIM AND LOOKING UP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A WOOD
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0024 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0025 THE WRETCHED SINGER WHO MOCKS AT WOMEN AND WILL HAVE NO BRIDE BUT THE DEAD COME LET US KILL HIM AND SHOW THAT NO MAN SHALL DESPISE US UNPUNISHED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BEGAN TO THROW WANDS AND STONES AT HIM
8108-280354-0027 AND IN THEIR FURY THE WOMEN FELL UPON HIM DEALING BLOW ON BLOW ORPHEUS FELL LIFELESS TO THE GROUND BUT HE WAS NOT TO DIE UNWEPT THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FOREST MOURNED FOR HIM EVEN THE STONY ROCKS WEPT
8108-280354-0028 THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
8108-280354-0030 IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
8108-280354-0031 AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
8108-280359-0001 THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
8108-280359-0002 AND NO MEASURE FOR THE DEEP WATERS NEITHER IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF COUNTING THE VARIOUS FORMS UNDER WHICH I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF ODIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND ME
8108-280359-0004 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
8108-280359-0005 AND HE KNEW THAT IT CAME FROM THE EYE OF ODIN WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM AIR THRONE THEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFUL EYE BY DISGUISING HIMSELF UNDER VARIOUS SHAPES SOMETIMES HE WAS AN EAGLE ON A LONELY MOUNTAIN CRAG
8108-280359-0007 OR ALONE WITH DEAD NATURE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW HIM AND TO FIND A VOICE IN WHICH TO SAY TO HIM
8108-280359-0008 AIR EARTH OR WATER THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM ANYWHERE TIRED AT LAST OF SEEKING WHAT HE COULD NOWHERE FIND LOKI BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE NEAR A NARROW GLITTERING RIVER WHICH LOWER DOWN FLASHED FROM A HIGH ROCK INTO THE SEA BELOW
8108-280359-0010 ALI AND NARI CAME TO LIVE WITH HIM SIGUNA WAS A KIND WOMAN FAR TOO GOOD AND KIND FOR LOKI SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM NOW THAT SHE SAW HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR AND THAT EVERY LIVING THING HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM
8108-280359-0011 AND SHE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN HIM FROM THE JUST ANGER OF THE GODS IF SHE COULD BUT THE TWO SONS CARED LITTLE ABOUT THEIR FATHER'S DREAD AND DANGER THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME IN QUARRELING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR LOUD ANGRY VOICES SOUNDING ABOVE THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0013 BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
8108-280359-0014 HE ROSE WITHOUT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN THREW HIS NET ON A FIRE THAT BURNED ON THE FLOOR AND RUSHING TO THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE RIVER HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A SALMON SWAM DOWN TO THE DEEPEST STILLEST POOL AT THE BOTTOM
8108-280359-0016 FAMOUS FOR HIS KEEN SIGHT SPIED OUT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHING NET IN THE FIRE THEN ODIN KNEW AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS A RIVER NEAR AND THAT IT WAS THERE WHERE LOKI HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF HE ORDERED HIS SONS TO MAKE A NEW NET AND TO CAST IT INTO THE WATER
8108-280359-0017 AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
8108-280359-0019 BUT NOT SO QUICKLY BUT THAT THE GODS SAW HIM KNEW HIM THROUGH HIS DISGUISE AND RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD NO LONGER ESCAPE THEY THEMSELVES DIVIDED INTO TWO BANDS THOR WADED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0020 THE OTHER GODS STOOD IN A GROUP BELOW LOKI SWAM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THEM FIRST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DART OUT INTO THE SEA AND THEN THAT HE WOULD SPRING OVER THE NET BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIVER THIS LAST SEEMED THE EASIEST WAY OF ESCAPE
8108-280359-0022 LOKI WRIGGLED HIS SLIPPERY SLIMY LENGTH THROUGH THOR'S FINGERS BUT THE THUNDERER GRASPED HIM TIGHTLY BY THE TAIL AND HOLDING HIM IN THIS MANNER IN THIS HAND WADED TO THE SHORE THERE FATHER ODIN AND THE OTHER GODS MET HIM AND
8108-280359-0023 AT ODIN'S FIRST SEARCHING LOOK LOKI WAS OBLIGED TO DROP HIS DISGUISE AND COWERING AND FRIGHTENED TO ASSUME HIS PROPER SHAPE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED LORDS ONE BY ONE THEY TURNED THEIR FACES FROM HIM FOR IN LOOKING AT HIM
8108-280359-0025 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8108-280359-0026 LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
8108-280359-0028 A ROPE WAS MADE OF THE DEAD WOLVES SINEWS AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED LOKI'S BODY IT TURNED INTO BANDS OF IRON
8123-275193-0000 JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8123-275193-0002 MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
8123-275193-0003 HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
8123-275193-0005 POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
8123-275193-0006 THE DOCTOR WAS CONSULTED AND AFTER A CAREFUL DIAGNOSIS DECIDED THERE WAS NO ORGANIC DISEASE WANT OF PARENTAL CARE WANT OF NOURISHMENT AND EXPOSURE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR JEFF'S UNFAVORABLE CONDITION
8123-275193-0008 HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
8123-275193-0009 HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
8123-275193-0011 AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
8123-275193-0012 IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
8123-275193-0014 HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
8123-275193-0015 WHEN ON SHORE HE FOLLOWED HIS FAVORITES LIKE A DOG AND WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ROOT EXCEPT IN SPEECH AND APPEARANCE HE WAS THE COUNTERPART OF A HAPPY GOOD NATURED AND WELL CARED FOR HOUSEHOLD DOG
8123-275193-0017 WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
8123-275193-0018 MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
8123-275193-0020 HIS REWARD FOR THIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND CONSISTED OF SOME APPLES AND A TOOTHSOME DESSERT OF SUGAR AFTERWARD HE MADE THE ROUND OF THE CAMPS WITH A SPECIAL ESCORT OF WARRANT OFFICERS AND DEVOTED JACK TARS
8123-275193-0021 HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
8123-275193-0023 JEFF WAS A CONFIRMED LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND IN TIME PAID THE USUAL PENALTY FOR OVER INDULGENCE OF HIS VERY PIGGISH APPETITE WHILE THE MEAL PENNANT WAS UP
8123-275193-0024 IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
8123-275193-0026 UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE
8123-275193-0027 AND GAVE FORTH MANY DISGRUNTLED GRUNTS WHEN LIFTED OUT OF THEM THE LAST TIME I SAW JEFF IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS BURIED UP TO HIS EARS IN THE COOL SANDS OF THE ROANOKE ISLAND SHORE WITH EYES UPTURNED AND LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAD PIG
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0025 I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
8123-275209-0026 I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
8123-275209-0028 OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
8123-275209-0029 INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
8123-275216-0000 TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0003 ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND
8123-275216-0005 I AM LORD IN THE LAND AND WHATEVER WAY YOU LOOK YOU FIND MY BROTHERS AND NOTHING ELSE TRUE MUTTERED THE BEAR THAT IS JUST WHAT IS SO SICKENING I HAVE BEEN FOR A LITTLE TOUR ABROAD I MAY TELL YOU AND AM JUST A LITTLE BIT SPOILT
8123-275216-0006 IT WAS IN A LAND DOWN TOWARDS THE SOUTH THERE I TOOK A NAP UNDER THE BEECH TREES THEY ARE TALL SLIM TREES NOT CROOKED OLD THINGS LIKE YOU AND THEIR TOPS ARE SO DENSE THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP THROUGH THEM
8123-275216-0008 AND PERHAPS YOU WILL BE KIND ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME AT PEACE SINCE YOU CANNOT GIVE ME SHADE THE BEAR STRETCHED HIMSELF OUT AND CLOSED HIS EYES BUT HE GOT NO SLEEP THAT TIME FOR THE OTHER TREES HAD HEARD HIS STORY
8123-275216-0009 WHAT KIND OF TREES CAN THEY BE WHOSE LEAVES SIT SO CLOSE TOGETHER THAT THE SUNBEAMS CANNOT CREEP BETWEEN THEM ASKED A LITTLE OAK WHO WAS LISTENING TO WHAT THE BIG ONES WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT BY HIS SIDE STOOD AN OLD GNARLED TREE
8123-275216-0011 I WILL BRING SOME BEECH NUTS WITH ME AND I VOW YOU WILL ALL TURN YELLOW WITH JEALOUSY WHEN YOU SEE HOW PRETTY THE NEW TREES ARE THEN HE MADE OFF BUT THE OAKS TALKED THE WHOLE DAY LONG ONE TO ANOTHER ABOUT THE FUNNY TREES HE HAD TOLD THEM ABOUT
8123-275216-0012 IF THEY COME I WILL KILL THEM SAID THE LITTLE OAK TREE BUT DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS HE GOT ONE ON THE HEAD FROM THE OLD OAK IF THEY COME YOU SHALL TREAT THEM POLITELY YOU YOUNG DOG SAID HE BUT THEY WILL NOT COME
8123-275216-0014 AND HE PICKED SOME FUNNY THINGS OUT OF HIS SHAGGY COAT HERE YOU MAY SEE WHAT I HAVE FOR YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED THE OAK THAT IS BEECH ANSWERED THE BEAR THE BEECH NUTS WHICH I PROMISED YOU
8123-275216-0015 THEY KILLED MY WIFE AND ONE OF MY BROTHERS AND I MUST SEE ABOUT FINDING A PLACE WHERE I CAN LIVE IN PEACE THERE IS SCARCELY A SPOT LEFT WHERE A SELF RESPECTING BEAR CAN STAY GOODBYE YOU OLD GNARLED OAK TREES
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
8123-275216-0020 YOU ARE WELCOME AMONG US SAID THE OLD OAK AND GRACIOUSLY INCLINED HIS HEAD TO THEM YOU SHALL BE MY FOSTER CHILDREN AND BE TREATED JUST AS WELL AS MY OWN THANKS SAID THE LITTLE BEECHES
8123-275216-0021 AND THEY SAID NO MORE BUT THE LITTLE OAK COULD NOT BEAR THE STRANGE TREES IT IS DREADFUL THE WAY YOU SHOOT UP INTO THE AIR HE SAID IN VEXATION YOU ARE ALREADY HALF AS TALL AS I AM BUT I BEG YOU TO TAKE NOTICE THAT I AM MUCH OLDER
8123-275216-0023 MANY THANKS ANSWERED THE BEECHES WE CAN GROW VERY NICELY IN THE SHADE AND THE WHOLE SUMMER PASSED BY AND ANOTHER SUMMER AFTER THAT AND STILL MORE SUMMERS THE BEECHES WENT ON GROWING
8123-275216-0024 AND AT LAST QUITE OVERTOPPED THE LITTLE OAK KEEP YOUR LEAVES TO YOURSELF CRIED THE OAK YOU OVERSHADOW ME AND THAT IS WHAT I CAN'T ENDURE I MUST HAVE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING
8123-275216-0029 EVERY ONE HAS HIS OWN MANNER OF GROWTH AND WE HAVE OURS ANSWERED THE YOUNG BEECHES THIS IS THE WAY IT'S DONE WHERE WE COME FROM AND WE ARE PERHAPS AS GOOD AS YOU ARE
8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8226-274369-0001 BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
8226-274369-0002 HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
8226-274369-0004 THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0005 OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
8226-274369-0007 HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
8226-274369-0008 AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
8226-274369-0010 TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
8226-274369-0011 THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
8226-274369-0013 AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
8226-274369-0014 UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY
8226-274369-0016 THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
8226-274369-0017 AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
8226-274369-0019 HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
8226-274369-0020 AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
8226-274369-0022 AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
8226-274369-0023 AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
8226-274369-0025 DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
8226-274369-0026 THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
8226-274369-0028 BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
8226-274369-0029 THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
8226-274369-0031 THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032 THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0034 THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0035 THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0037 THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0040 HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0041 IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0043 BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044 AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0046 THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0049 BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
8226-274369-0050 MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0052 THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
8226-274369-0053 AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
8226-274369-0055 THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0056 I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
8226-274369-0058 NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
8226-274369-0059 WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
8226-274369-0061 HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
8226-274369-0062 AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS
8226-274371-0000 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0003 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0006 WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
8226-274371-0007 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0009 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0012 AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0015 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0019 WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
8226-274371-0021 NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
8226-274371-0022 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0024 WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
8226-274371-0025 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0027 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0030 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0033 WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
8226-274371-0034 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0036 AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0037 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040 IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0043 HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
8226-274371-0045 THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0048 THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
8226-274371-0049 THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0051 THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
8226-274371-0052 BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
8238-274553-0000 I'LL HAVE NONE O THEM NED KNOWLES THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG WAS A NOBLE HUNGARIAN FAMILY EVERY MEMBER OF WHICH AT LEAST AS FAR BACK INTO ANTIQUITY AS ANY CERTAIN RECORDS EXTEND
8238-274553-0001 WAS MORE OR LESS REMARKABLE FOR TALENT OF SOME DESCRIPTION THE MAJORITY FOR THAT SPECIES OF GROTESQUERIE IN CONCEPTION OF WHICH TIECK A SCION OF THE HOUSE HAS GIVEN A VIVID
8238-274553-0003 WHICH HIS ADVENT EXCITED WITHIN THE COLLEGE PRECINCTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE I REMEMBER STILL MORE DISTINCTLY THAT WHILE HE WAS PRONOUNCED BY ALL PARTIES AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0004 NO PERSON MADE ANY ATTEMPT AT ACCOUNTING FOR HIS OPINION THAT HE WAS UNIQUE APPEARED SO UNDENIABLE THAT IT WAS DEEMED IMPERTINENT TO INQUIRE WHEREIN THE UNIQUITY CONSISTED
8238-274553-0006 MANNERS PERSONS PURSES AND PROPENSITIES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AN INFLUENCE THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DESPOTIC YET AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST INDEFINITE AND ALTOGETHER UNACCOUNTABLE
8238-274553-0007 THAT VERY EXTRAORDINARY EPOCH FORMING THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG THEN OF NO PARTICULAR AGE BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A GUESS RESPECTING HIS AGE BY ANY DATA PERSONALLY AFFORDED
8238-274553-0009 HE WAS BY NO MEANS A HANDSOME MAN PERHAPS THE REVERSE THE CONTOUR OF HIS FACE WAS SOMEWHAT ANGULAR AND HARSH HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOFTY AND VERY FAIR HIS NOSE A SNUB
8238-274553-0010 AFTER SUCH A FASHION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE ANY EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX COMBINATION OF HUMAN FEATURES CONVEYING SO ENTIRELY AND SO SINGLY THE IDEA OF UNMITIGATED GRAVITY
8238-274553-0012 THE STUDY AND THE BUSINESS OF THEIR LIVES FOR THIS SCIENCE A PECULIAR TURN OF MIND GAVE HIM INSTINCTIVELY THE CUE
8238-274553-0013 I QUAINTLY TERMED THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG EVER RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO THE MYSTERY WHICH OVERSHADOWED HIS CHARACTER I TRULY THINK THAT NO PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF
8238-274553-0015 THIS TOO WHEN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND UNPARDONABLE OF ALL CONCEIVABLE TRICKS WHIMSICALITIES AND BUFFOONERIES WERE BROUGHT ABOUT IF NOT DIRECTLY BY HIM
8238-274553-0016 LAY IN THAT CONSUMMATE ABILITY RESULTING FROM AN ALMOST INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE AND A MOST WONDERFUL SELF POSSESSION
8238-274553-0018 WHICH UPON EACH SUCH FAILURE OF HIS PRAISE WORTHY ENDEAVORS WOULD SUFFUSE EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE LEFT NOT THE SLIGHTEST ROOM FOR DOUBT OF HIS SINCERITY IN THE BOSOMS OF EVEN HIS MOST SKEPTICAL COMPANIONS
8238-274553-0019 THE ADROITNESS TOO WAS NO LESS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION BY WHICH HE CONTRIVED TO SHIFT THE SENSE OF THE GROTESQUE FROM THE CREATOR TO THE CREATED
8238-274553-0021 MY FRIEND APPEARED TO LIVE ONLY FOR THE SEVERITIES OF SOCIETY AND NOT EVEN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD
8238-274553-0022 WITH THE MEMORY OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG
8238-274553-0024 DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT HAD RUN WILD UPON THE ALL ENGROSSING TOPIC OF THE TIMES THE BARON WHO HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SILENT AND ABSTRACTED IN THE EARLIER PORTION OF THE EVENING
8238-274553-0025 AND DWELT UPON THE BENEFITS AND MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE BEAUTIES OF THE RECEIVED CODE OF ETIQUETTE IN PASSAGES OF ARMS WITH AN ARDOR AN ELOQUENCE
8238-274553-0027 A RIDICULER OF THOSE VERY POINTS FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED AND ESPECIALLY TO HOLD THE ENTIRE FANFARONADE OF DUELLING ETIQUETTE IN THE SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT WHICH IT DESERVES
8238-274553-0028 LOOKING AROUND ME DURING A PAUSE IN THE BARON'S DISCOURSE OF WHICH MY READERS MAY GATHER SOME FAINT IDEA WHEN I SAY THAT IT BORE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FERVID CHANTING MONOTONOUS YET MUSICAL SERMONIC MANNER OF COLERIDGE
8238-274553-0030 AND I BELIEVE FOR SOME LOGICAL TALENT AS A DUELLIST HE HAD ACQUIRED WHO HAD FALLEN AT HIS HANDS BUT THEY WERE MANY HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE UNDOUBTEDLY
8238-274553-0031 BUT IT WAS UPON HIS MINUTE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DUELLO AND THE NICETY OF HIS SENSE OF HONOR THAT HE MOST ESPECIALLY PRIDED HIMSELF THESE THINGS WERE A HOBBY WHICH HE RODE TO THE DEATH TO RITZNER
8238-274553-0033 I PERCEIVED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LATTER MOMENTLY INCREASING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE OFFERING SOME OBJECTION TO A POINT INSISTED UPON BY R AND GIVING HIS REASONS IN DETAIL
8238-274553-0034 TO THESE THE BARON REPLIED AT LENGTH STILL MAINTAINING HIS EXAGGERATED TONE OF SENTIMENT AND CONCLUDING IN WHAT I THOUGHT VERY BAD TASTE WITH A SARCASM AND A SNEER
8238-274553-0036 I WOULD SAY SIR THAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN AS HERMANN COMPLETED THIS EQUIVOCAL SENTENCE ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE BARON
8238-274553-0037 THEN EXCESSIVELY RED THEN DROPPING HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF STOOPED TO RECOVER IT WHEN I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIS COUNTENANCE WHILE IT COULD BE SEEN BY NO ONE ELSE AT THE TABLE
8238-274553-0039 FOR A MOMENT I EVEN FANCIED THAT I HAD MISCONCEIVED HIM AND THAT HE WAS IN SOBER EARNEST HE APPEARED TO BE STIFLING WITH PASSION AND HIS FACE WAS CADAVEROUSLY WHITE
8238-274553-0040 FOR A SHORT TIME HE REMAINED SILENT APPARENTLY STRIVING TO MASTER HIS EMOTION HAVING AT LENGTH SEEMINGLY SUCCEEDED HE REACHED A DECANTER WHICH STOOD NEAR HIM SAYING AS HE HELD IT FIRMLY CLENCHED
8238-274553-0042 IN ADDRESSING YOURSELF TO ME IS OBJECTIONABLE IN SO MANY PARTICULARS THAT I HAVE NEITHER TEMPER NOR TIME FOR SPECIFICATION THAT MY OPINIONS HOWEVER ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN
8238-274553-0043 IS AN OBSERVATION SO DIRECTLY OFFENSIVE AS TO ALLOW ME BUT ONE LINE OF CONDUCT
8238-274553-0045 THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
8238-274553-0046 WHILE THE NECESSITY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO YOUR REAL PERSON WILL BE OBVIATED WITH THESE WORDS HE HURLED THE DECANTER FULL OF WINE AGAINST THE MIRROR WHICH HUNG DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HERMANN
8238-274553-0048 AS HERMANN WENT OUT THE BARON WHISPERED ME THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW HIM AND MAKE AN OFFER OF MY SERVICES TO THIS I AGREED NOT KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT TO MAKE OF SO RIDICULOUS A PIECE OF BUSINESS
8238-274553-0049 AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS APARTMENT I COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING IN HIS FACE WHILE HE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY WHAT HE TERMED THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR CHARACTER
8238-274553-0051 THE THEATRE OF HONOR BY FAVYN
8238-274553-0052 BRANTOME'S MEMOIRS OF DUELS PUBLISHED AT COLOGNE SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX
8238-274553-0054 AND HAVING THE QUAINT TITLE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0055 FROM THIS HE READ ME ONE OF THE DROLLEST CHAPTERS IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0057 ALTHOUGH NOT ONE SYLLABLE OF THE WHOLE MATTER COULD I UNDERSTAND FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVING FINISHED THE CHAPTER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND DEMANDED WHAT I THOUGHT NECESSARY TO BE DONE I REPLIED THAT I HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUPERIOR DELICACY OF FEELING
8238-274553-0058 WILL HAND YOU THIS NOTE I FIND IT INCUMBENT UPON ME TO REQUEST AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE AN EXPLANATION OF THIS EVENING'S OCCURRENCES AT YOUR CHAMBERS IN THE EVENT OF YOUR DECLINING THIS REQUEST
8238-274553-0060 UPON DUE REFLECTION I FRANKLY ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF THE EXPLANATION YOU SUGGEST THIS BEING ADMITTED I STILL FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY OWING TO THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR NATURE OF OUR DISAGREEMENT
8238-274553-0061 I HAVE GREAT RELIANCE HOWEVER ON THAT EXTREME DELICACY OF DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
8238-274553-0063 TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ME REFERRING YOU TO THIS ADMIRABLE PASSAGE OUGHT TO SATISFY YOUR REQUEST AS A MAN OF HONOR FOR EXPLANATION WITH SENTIMENTS OF PROFOUND RESPECT YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT VON JUNG
8238-274553-0064 HERMANN COMMENCED THE PERUSAL OF THIS EPISTLE WITH A SCOWL WHICH HOWEVER WAS CONVERTED INTO A SMILE OF THE MOST LUDICROUS SELF COMPLACENCY
8238-274553-0066 TO ASSURE HIM THAT THE EXPLANATION OFFERED WAS OF THE FULLEST THE MOST HONORABLE AND THE MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY SATISFACTORY NATURE SOMEWHAT AMAZED AT ALL THIS I MADE MY RETREAT TO THE BARON
8238-274553-0067 HE SEEMED TO RECEIVE HERMANN'S AMICABLE LETTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL CONVERSATION WENT TO AN INNER ROOM AND BROUGHT OUT THE EVERLASTING TREATISE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0069 HE NOW EXPLAINED THE MYSTERY
8238-274553-0070 AND EVEN OF PROFUNDITY WHILE IN FACT NOT A SHADOW OF MEANING EXISTED THE KEY TO THE WHOLE WAS FOUND IN LEAVING OUT EVERY SECOND AND THIRD WORD ALTERNATELY
8238-274553-0072 TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ADVENTURE AND THAT HE WAS SATISFIED FROM THE GENERAL TENOR OF HIS CONVERSATION
8238-274553-0073 AND FIRMLY BELIEVED IT TO BE A WORK OF UNUSUAL MERIT UPON THIS HINT HE PROCEEDED
8238-283452-0000 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0001 AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
8238-283452-0003 IN THAT HER LOCKS BEING LONG AND PINNED UP ARE LESS EASILY MOVED WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE FACT IF IT BE A FACT THAT IN FICTION WOMEN HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES MORE SELF POSSESSED
8238-283452-0004 WHILE THE FEMININE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH BY ANOTHER WOMAN AND THUS DISARMED THE MAJORITY OF THE COMIC APPARITIONS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ARE MASCULINE YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND WOMEN WRAITHED IN SMILES
8238-283452-0006 THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8238-283452-0007 THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES AS IN THE CASE OF THE GHOST BABY MENTIONED LATER BUT VERY FEW ANCIENT GHOSTS WERE A LONG FACED LOT
8238-283452-0009 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
8238-283452-0010 TO MAKE THE GHOST OF MISSUS GRUNDY TURN A SHADE PALER IN HORROR NOWADAYS HAUNTERS HAVE MORE FUN AND FREEDOM THAN THE HAUNTED IN FACT IT'S MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THESE DAYS TO BE DEAD FOR GHOSTS HAVE NO RENT PROBLEMS
8238-283452-0012 THE SPECTERS IN CLASSIC AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE WERE MALARIAL VAPOROUS BEINGS WITHOUT ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING BUT THREATEN
8238-283452-0013 AT BEST A REVENANT COULD ONLY RATTLE A RUSTY SKELETON OR SHAKE A MOLDY SHROUD OR CLANK A CHAIN BUT AS MORTALS COWERED BEFORE HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE DIDN'T WORRY
8238-283452-0015 HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO WEAPON NO THREAT IN HORROR TO BE COMPARED WITH RIDICULE THINK WHAT A SOLEMN CREATURE THE GOTHIC GHOST WAS
8238-283452-0016 HOW LITTLE ORIGINALITY AND INITIATIVE HE SHOWED AND HOW DEPENDENT HE WAS ON HIS OWN ATMOSPHERE FOR THRILLS HIS SOLE APPEAL WAS TO THE SPINAL COLUMN THE GHOST OF TO DAY TOUCHES THE FUNNY BONE AS WELL
8238-283452-0018 AFTER THAT SHOW OF SPIRITS THE TURNIPS IN THAT FIELD TASTED OF RUM LONG AFTER THE GHOST SHIP HAD SAILED AWAY INTO THE BLUE THE MODERN SPOOK IS POSSESSED NOT ONLY OF HUMOR BUT OF A CAUSTIC SATIRE AS WELL
8238-283452-0019 HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM
8238-283452-0021 GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
8238-283452-0022 THE MODERN HUMOROUS GHOST SATIRIZES EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD FASHIONED SPECTER HE'S VERY FOND OF TAKING POT SHOTS AT HIM TO THE LATEST PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS
8238-283452-0024 AND USES THE OLD THRILLS ONLY TO SHOW WHAT DEAD BATTERIES THEY COME FROM HIS REALLY ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ARE HIS OWN INVENTIONS HE NEEDS NO DUNGEON KEEPS AND MONKISH CELLS TO PLAY ABOUT IN NOT HE
8238-283452-0025 HE DEMANDS NO RAG NOR BONE NOR CLANK OF CHAIN OF HIS OLD EQUIPMENT TO START ON HIS CAREER HE CAN START UP A MOVING PICTURE SHOW OF HIS OWN AS IN RUTH MC ENERY STUART'S THE HAUNTED PHOTOGRAPH
8238-283452-0027 WHERE THE SUITOR ON THE MOONLIT PORCH ATTEMPTING TO TELL HIS FAIR ONE THAT HE DOTES ON HER SEES THE GHOST OF HER FEROCIOUS UNCLE WHO ISN'T DEAD
8238-283452-0028 KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
8238-283452-0030 IN THE OLDER FICTION AND DRAMA APPARITIONS SPOKE SELDOM
8238-283452-0031 AND GHOSTS LIKE KINGS IN DRAMA WERE OF A DIGNITY AND MUST PRESERVE IT IN THEIR SPEECH OR PERHAPS THE AUTHORS WERE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE DIALOGUE OF SHADES
8238-283452-0033 THINK OF HAVING ALWAYS AND ALWAYS TO SPEAK A DEAD LANGUAGE THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS NOT ONLY MODERN BUT HE IS DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THERE ARE GHOSTS OF ALL NATIONALITIES NATURALLY
8238-283452-0034 BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
8238-283452-0036 THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SELECTIONS IN THIS VOLUME ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CONTRARY
8238-283452-0037 THERE ARE VARIOUS ENGLISH STORIES OF WHIMSICAL HAUNTING SOME OF ACTUAL SPOOKS AND SOME OF THE HOAX TYPE HOAX GHOSTS ARE FAIRLY NUMEROUS IN BRITISH AS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
8238-283452-0039 IN THAT WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL YOUNG BACHELOR ENGAGED TO A CHARMING GIRL WHO IS ENTANGLED IN SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS AND MADE TO SUFFER MENTAL TORMENT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
8238-283452-0040 TILL THE PHANTOM COUPLE TAKE A LIKING TO EACH OTHER AND DECIDE TO LET THE LIVING BURY THEIR DEAD THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BRANDER MATTHEWS'S EARLIER AND CLEVERER STORY OF A SPECTRAL COURTSHIP IN THE RIVAL GHOSTS
8238-283452-0042 SHOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGLISH HUMOR AS ASSOCIATED WITH APPARITIONS AND ARE ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE IS ONE OF HIS BEST SHORT STORIES
8238-283452-0043 THIS TRAVESTY ON THE CONVENTIONAL TRADITIONS OF THE WRAITH IS PREPOSTEROUSLY DELIGHTFUL ONE OF THE CLEVEREST GHOST STORIES IN OUR LANGUAGE ZANGWILL HAS WRITTEN ENGAGINGLY OF SPOOKS
8238-283452-0045 JOHN KENDRICK BANGS HAS MADE THE DARKER REGIONS SEEM COMFORTABLE AND HOMELIKE FOR US AND HAS CREATED GHOSTS SO HUMAN AND SO FUNNY THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ONE OR MORE
8238-283452-0046 WE FEEL DOWNRIGHT NEIGHBORLY TOWARD SUCH SPECTERS AS THE FUTILE LAST GHOST NELSON LLOYD EVOKES FOR US AS WE APPRECIATE THE SATIRE OF ROSE O'NEILL'S SOPHISTICATED WRAITH
8312-279790-0000 WHERE HE SPENT HIS TIME IN KNOCKING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WALL UNTIL THE COURTIERS WERE AFRAID HE WOULD KILL HIMSELF THEY ACCORDINGLY PLACED STUFFED MATTRESSES OVER EVERY WALL AND ALLOWED ALL HIS SUBJECTS WHO DESIRED
8312-279790-0001 COVERED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN A LONG CRAPE VEIL WHO WEPT AND SOBBED SO MUCH THAT THE KING NOTICED HER SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID NOT COME LIKE THE REST TO CONSOLE HIM BUT RATHER TO ENCOURAGE HIS GRIEF
8312-279790-0003 SHE DID THE SAME OF HER DEAR HUSBAND IN FACT THEY TALKED SO MUCH THAT THEY TALKED THEIR SORROW QUITE AWAY THEN LIFTING UP HER VEIL SHE SHOWED LOVELY BLUE EYES AND DARK EYELASHES
8312-279790-0004 THE KING NOTICED HER MORE AND MORE HE SPOKE LESS AND LESS OF THE DEPARTED QUEEN BY AND BY HE CEASED TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL THE END WAS THAT HE COURTED THE INCONSOLABLE LADY IN THE BLACK VEIL AND MARRIED HER
8312-279790-0006 WHO WAS BEING BROUGHT UP BY HER GODMOTHER THE FAIRY SOUSSIO HER NAME WAS TROUTINA BECAUSE HER COMPLEXION WAS ALL SPOTTED LIKE A TROUT'S BACK INDEED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE AND WHEN CONTRASTED WITH FLORINA
8312-279790-0007 THE KING DISPUTED NOTHING INDEED HE NEVER DID THE QUEEN RULED HIM IN ALL THINGS SOME TIME AFTER NEWS CAME THAT KING CHARMING WOULD SHORTLY ARRIVE
8312-279790-0009 WHO PRESENTED TO HIM TROUTINA ALL BLAZING WITH JEWELS YET SO UGLY THAT KING CHARMING INVOLUNTARILY TURNED AWAY HIS EYES BUT MADAM IS THERE NOT ANOTHER PRINCESS CALLED FLORINA
8312-279790-0010 HE ROSE AND MADE HER A PROFOUND REVERENCE PAYING HER BESIDES SO MANY ELEGANT COMPLIMENTS THAT THE QUEEN BECAME VERY MUCH DISPLEASED KING CHARMING TOOK NO HEED
8312-279790-0012 FOUR MEN IN MASKS ENTERED AND CARRIED HER OFF LEAVING HER IN A DARK CELL AND IN THE UTMOST DESOLATION MEANTIME KING CHARMING EAGERLY AWAITED HER RE APPEARANCE BUT HE SAW HER NO MORE
8312-279790-0013 AND BY THE QUEEN'S ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM SPOKE ALL THE EVIL THEY COULD OF POOR FLORINA BUT HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE ONE WORD NO SAID HE NATURE COULD NOT HAVE UNITED A BASE NATURE TO SUCH A SWEET INNOCENT FACE
8312-279790-0015 ALAS THE LITTLE BEAUTY I HAVE HAS COST ME SORE THE QUEEN TO WIN KING CHARMING FOR HER DAUGHTER MADE HIM MANY PRESENTS AMONG THE REST AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD A GOLDEN HEART
8312-279790-0016 BUT PIERCED BY ONE ONLY THE MOTTO BEING SHE ALONE THE HEART WAS MADE OF A SINGLE RUBY AS BIG AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG
8312-279790-0018 AS I CANNOT FULFIL IT TO TROUTINA I WOULD RATHER DECLINE THE FAVOUR SHE OFFERS ME THAN BECOME UNWORTHY OF IT CIVIL AS THIS ANSWER WAS IT IRRITATED THE QUEEN AND HER DAUGHTER EXCEEDINGLY
8312-279790-0019 AND WHEN SINCE IN ALL HIS AUDIENCES WITH THEIR MAJESTIES HE NEVER SAW FLORINA HE AT LAST INQUIRED WHERE THE YOUNGER PRINCESS WAS THE QUEEN ANSWERED FIERCELY THAT SHE WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON AND WOULD REMAIN THERE TILL TROUTINA WAS MARRIED
8312-279790-0021 NEXT NIGHT TROUTINA THICKLY VEILED
8312-279790-0022 KING CHARMING MET HER RECEIVED HER IN HIS ARMS AND VOWED TO LOVE HER FOR EVER THEN HE LIFTED HER INTO THE FAIRY CHARIOT AND THEY SAILED ABOUT IN THE AIR FOR SOME HOURS
8312-279790-0024 MY CHILD REPLIED THE GODMOTHER THAT IS MORE EASILY SAID THAN DONE HE IS TOO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH FLORINA MEANTIME THE KING WAS LEFT WAITING IN A CHAMBER WITH DIAMOND WALLS SO THIN AND TRANSPARENT
8312-279790-0025 THAT THROUGH THEM HE SAW TROUTINA AND SOUSSIO CONVERSING TOGETHER HE STOOD LIKE A MAN IN A DREAM WHAT AM I BETRAYED HAS THIS ENEMY TO MY PEACE CARRIED AWAY MY DEAR FLORINA
8312-279790-0027 DO YOU THINK ME A FOOL CRIED THE KING I HAVE PROMISED HER NOTHING SHE IS STOP IF YOU SHOW ME ANY DISRESPECT I WILL RESPECT YOU AS MUCH AS A FAIRY DESERVES TO BE RESPECTED
8312-279790-0028 IF YOU WILL ONLY GIVE ME BACK MY PRINCESS AM NOT I SHE SAID TROUTINA IT WAS TO ME YOU GAVE THIS RING TO ME YOU SPOKE AT THE WINDOW I HAVE BEEN WICKEDLY DECEIVED CRIED THE KING
8312-279790-0030 AND THEN TRIED QUIET SULKINESS BUT THE KING UTTERED NOT A WORD FOR TWENTY DAYS AND TWENTY NIGHTS HE STOOD THERE WITHOUT SLEEPING OR EATING OR ONCE SITTING DOWN THEY TALKING ALL THE WHILE AT LENGTH SOUSSIO
8312-279790-0031 QUITE WORN OUT SAID CHOOSE SEVEN YEARS OF PENITENCE AND PUNISHMENT OR MARRY MY GODDAUGHTER I CHOOSE ANSWERED THE KING AND I WILL NOT MARRY YOUR GODDAUGHTER THEN FLY OUT OF THIS WINDOW IN THE SHAPE OF A BLUE BIRD
8312-279790-0033 HIS BODY WASTED INTO THE SLENDER SHAPE OF A BIRD AND WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEATHERS HIS EYES BECAME ROUND AND BEADY HIS NOSE AN IVORY BEAK AND HIS CROWN WAS A WHITE PLUME ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
8312-279790-0034 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SINGING VOICE AND THEN UTTERING A DOLEFUL CRY FLED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATAL PALACE OF SOUSSIO BUT THOUGH HE LOOKED ONLY A BLUE BIRD
8312-279790-0036 AND WISHED HE WERE DEAD MANY A TIME THE FAIRY SOUSSIO SENT BACK TROUTINA TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS FURIOUS FLORINA SHALL REPENT HAVING PLEASED KING CHARMING CRIED SHE
8312-279790-0037 AND DRESSING HER OWN DAUGHTER IN RICH GARMENTS WITH A GOLD CROWN ON HER HEAD AND KING CHARMING'S RING ON HER FINGER SHE TOOK HER TO THE TOWER FLORINA YOUR SISTER IS COME TO SEE AND BRING YOU MARRIAGE PRESENTS
8312-279790-0039 LEST SHE SHOULD IN SOME WAY DISGRACE HERSELF THE KING SAID HER STEPMOTHER MIGHT DO WITH HER EXACTLY WHAT SHE PLEASED WHEN THE PRINCESS RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON SHE BEGAN TO WEEP AND WEPT ALL NIGHT LONG
8312-279790-0040 BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO SHE WAS AND AT DAYLIGHT SHE SHUT THE WINDOW NEXT NIGHT IT WAS BROAD MOONLIGHT AND THEN HE SAW CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A YOUNG GIRL WEEPING SORE AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIS BELOVED FLORINA
8312-279790-0042 A KING WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL NEVER LOVE ANY OTHER SO SAYING HE FLEW UP TO THE WINDOW AND AT FIRST FRIGHTENED THE PRINCESS VERY MUCH FOR SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING
8312-279790-0043 AS A BIRD WHO TALKED IN WORDS LIKE A MAN YET KEPT STILL THE PIPING VOICE OF A NIGHTINGALE BUT SOON SHE BEGAN STROKING HIS BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE AND CARESSING HIM WHO ARE YOU CHARMING BIRD
8312-279790-0045 SANG THE BLUE BIRD AND TOLD HER HIS WHOLE STORY WHICH COMFORTED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE THOUGHT NO MORE OF HER MISFORTUNES THEY CONVERSED TILL DAYBREAK AND PROMISED FAITHFULLY EVERY NIGHT TO MEET AGAIN THUS
8312-279790-0046 WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SAW HIS POOR FEATHERS SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND KNEW THAT HE WAS NO MORE SO SHE GRIEVED ALL DAY LONG THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE BIRD HID IN A HOLLOW TREE SPENT THE HOURS IN THINKING OF HIS PRINCESS
8312-279790-0048 WHERE HE SANG HER PRAISES IN A VOICE SO SWEET THAT THE PASSERS BY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A BIRD BUT A SPIRIT RUMOURS WENT ABOUT THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED AND NO ONE WOULD GO NEAR THE SPOT
8312-279790-0049 AND THOUGH SHE SAW NOBODY AND HE LIVED IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE THEY ALWAYS FOUND PLENTY TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER THE MALICIOUS QUEEN TRIED WITH ALL HER MIGHT TO GET TROUTINA MARRIED BUT IN VAIN NOBODY WOULD HAVE HER
8312-279790-0051 WHO LIKED TO SEE HER LOVELY AND SHE HAD ADORNED HERSELF WITH ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE HAD GIVEN HER HE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL AND SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WERE SINGING TOGETHER A DUET WHICH THE QUEEN HEARD OUTSIDE
8312-279791-0000 BUT HE WOULD NOT HE HAD SEEN THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA AND THOUGH HE COULD NOT DEFEND HIS PRINCESS HE REFUSED TO LEAVE HER THE TWO RUSHED UPON HER LIKE FURIES HER WONDERFUL BEAUTY AND HER SPLENDID JEWELS STARTLED THEM
8312-279791-0002 AND ADORN YOUR CHAMBER WITH FLOWERS I HAVE LEISURE ENOUGH I MAY JUST AS WELL SPEND SOME OF IT IN ADORNING MYSELF INSTEAD OF BEMOANING MY MISFORTUNE INNOCENT AS I AM INNOCENT INDEED CRIED THE QUEEN
8312-279791-0003 AND BEGAN TO SEARCH THE ROOM IN IT SHE FOUND ALL KING CHARMING'S PRESENTS DIAMONDS RUBIES EMERALDS AMETHYSTS IN SHORT JEWELS WITHOUT END MEANTIME FROM THE WINDOW THE BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0005 AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
8312-279791-0006 WHEN THE PRINCESS LEARNT THIS SHE WAS IN GREAT GRIEF ALAS CRIED SHE I CAN NO LONGER TALK WITH MY BIRD WHO LOVED ME SO
8312-279791-0008 THE BLUE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW SILL AND THEY LAVISHED ON ONE ANOTHER A HUNDRED CARESSES AND TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAWN NEXT NIGHT IT HAPPENED THE SAME TILL THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE WAITING MAID
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0011 AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0012 BUT NO BLUE BIRD APPEARED THE QUEEN HAD CAUSED SHARP KNIVES TO BE HUNG OUTSIDE THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE HE FLEW AGAINST THEM AND CUT HIS FEET AND WINGS TILL HE DROPPED DOWN COVERED WITH BLOOD
8312-279791-0014 HAD GONE EIGHT TIMES ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HIM MADE HIS NINTH JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE TREE WHERE THE POOR BLUE BIRD LAY CALLING OUT KING CHARMING KING CHARMING THE KING RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BEST FRIEND
8312-279791-0015 WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
8312-279791-0017 COME TO MY SIDE BUT NO ONE REGARDED HER AT LAST A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN HER FORTUNES THE KING HER FATHER DIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW SHE WAS HIS HEIR BEGAN TO INQUIRE WITH ONE ACCORD
8312-279791-0018 WHERE WAS THE PRINCESS FLORINA THEY ASSAILED THE PALACE IN CROWDS DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN THE RIOT BECAME SO DANGEROUS THAT TROUTINA AND HER MOTHER FLED AWAY TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0020 WHO WAS KING CHARMING'S FRIEND WENT TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO WHOM HE KNEW FOR THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND MADE IT UP AGAIN AS FAIRIES AND MAGICIANS DO MANY TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
8312-279791-0021 SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
8312-279791-0023 HE HAD BEEN A LINNET OR A JAY WORSE THAN ALL HIS NEXT HEIR SPREAD REPORTS OF HIS DEATH
8312-279791-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
8312-279791-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ALL ALONE GOOD MOTHER REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE TOO MANY TROUBLES TO BE PLEASANT COMPANY FOR ANYBODY TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SOFTEN THEM
8312-279791-0027 DO NOT AFFLICT YOURSELF HAPPINESS WILL YET BE YOURS TAKE THESE FOUR EGGS AND WHENEVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE BREAK THEM AND SEE WHAT ENSUES SO SAYING THE FAIRY VANISHED FLORINA
8312-279791-0029 SHE WALKED EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEN CAME TO A MOUNTAIN MADE ENTIRELY OF IVORY AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR DESPAIRING OF EVER CLIMBING IT
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0032 IN WHICH SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN STOOD ADMIRING THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEED FOR THE CHARM OF THE MIRROR WAS THAT EACH SAW HERSELF THEREIN NOT AS SHE WAS BUT AS SHE WISHED TO BE
8312-279791-0033 AND THE GRIMACES THEY MADE WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A PERSON TO DIE OF LAUGHTER NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER GAINED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW FLORINA THERE THEY ALL BURST INTO ANGRY OUTCRIES
8312-279791-0035 BESIDES HE IS GOING TO MORROW TO THE TEMPLE WITH THE PRINCESS TROUTINA WHOM HE HAS AT LAST AGREED TO MARRY FLORINA SAT DOWN ON A DOOR STEP AND HID HER FACE UNDER HER STRAW HAT AND HER DROOPING HAIR
8312-279791-0036 ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
8312-279791-0038 THESE ARE PRETTY TRINKETS SAID TROUTINA AND GOING UP TO THE KING SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM AT SIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS HE TURNED PALE REMEMBERING THOSE HE HAD GIVEN TO FLORINA
8312-279791-0039 THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
8312-279791-0041 NOW THE KING WHEN HE WAS A BLUE BIRD HAD INFORMED FLORINA ABOUT THIS CHAMBER OF ECHOES WHERE EVERY WORD SPOKEN COULD BE HEARD IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
8312-279791-0042 BUT SHE HAD NO MORE JEWELS TO TEMPT TROUTINA SO SHE BROKE THE THIRD EGG OUT OF IT CAME A CHARIOT OF POLISHED STEEL INLAID WITH GOLD DRAWN BY SIX GREEN MICE THE COACHMAN BEING A ROSE COLOURED RAT
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8312-279791-0045 UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
8312-279791-0047 AND SHE TOOK A HANDFUL OF THEM FROM HER SACK SHALL ASSUREDLY BE YOURS THE VALET PROMISED AND THEN FLORINA BROKE HER FOURTH EGG OUT OF WHICH CAME A PIE COMPOSED OF BIRDS WHICH THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PLUCKED
8312-279791-0048 BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
8312-279791-0050 AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0051 THE ONE WHO HAD GIVEN FLORINA THE FOUR EGGS THEY DECLARED THAT THEIR UNITED POWER WAS STRONGER THAN SOUSSIO'S AND THAT THE LOVERS SHOULD BE MARRIED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED TROUTINA SHE RAN TO THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES
8312-279791-0053 THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
8324-286681-0000 TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
8324-286681-0002 OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM SAID A STICKLEBACK WHY REPLIED THE MINNOW IF I HAD GONE TO THE EELS AND ASKED THEM THAT
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0005 THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
8324-286681-0006 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
8324-286681-0008 THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
8324-286681-0009 BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
8324-286681-0011 EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
8324-286681-0012 AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0014 AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
8324-286681-0015 ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0018 STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
8324-286681-0020 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0021 JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
8324-286681-0023 SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
8324-286681-0024 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
8324-286682-0001 AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
8324-286682-0002 WHERE THE YOUNG MINKS STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FOR IN EACH HOME THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN HUNGRY AND RESTLESS AND NEEDING TO BE TAUGHT MANY THINGS
8324-286682-0004 THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
8324-286682-0005 THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
8324-286682-0007 WE THINK MOST OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SCARCE OR HARD TO GET THERE WAS ONE OLD MINK BY THE RIVER WHO HAD A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IS EVEN MORE UNCOMMON
8324-286682-0008 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0010 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0014 AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0016 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0019 AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0022 OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
8324-286682-0023 WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
8324-286682-0025 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0028 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0029 AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
8324-286682-0031 WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
8324-286682-0032 HE THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME HE WOULD LOOK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL AND HOW AFTER HE HAD THAT HE COULD SURELY MARRY WHOEVER HE WISHED IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG HIS PEOPLE TO WANT TO MARRY THE BEST LOOKING AND STRONGEST
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0035 THEY FOUND SUCH A PLACE AND LAY DOWN THE BACHELOR ROLLED OVER THREE TIMES AND SMOOTHED HIS FUR HE WAS STILL SO TIRED FROM BEING IN THE TRAP THEN HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MINK VERY SHARPLY SO YOU WANT MY TAIL
8324-286682-0037 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0038 WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
8324-286682-0040 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0043 THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
8324-286682-0044 THAT IS ENOUGH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU CAN DIVE DEEPER STAY UNDER WATER LONGER RUN FASTER
8324-286682-0046 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0047 THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
8324-286683-0000 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0001 THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
8324-286683-0003 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0004 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
8324-286683-0006 IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
8324-286683-0007 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0009 THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
8324-286683-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
8324-286683-0012 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0015 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0016 SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
8324-286683-0018 IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
8324-286683-0019 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0021 SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
8324-286683-0022 TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
8324-286683-0024 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8324-286683-0028 TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
8324-286683-0030 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0033 FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
8324-286683-0034 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0036 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8419-286667-0000 THE DANCE OF THE SAND HILL CRANES ONE FINE DAY IN SPRING A GREAT FLOCK OF SAND HILL CRANES CAME FROM THE SOUTH THEY WERE FLYING HIGH AND QUIETLY BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN STORMY
8419-286667-0001 OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
8419-286667-0003 AS THEY CAME NEAR THE POND THEY FLEW LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL ALL SWEPT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND ALIGHTED TALL AND STATELY BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WERE SOON HUNTING FOR FOOD SOME ON LAND
8419-286667-0004 AND SOME IN THE WATER FOR THEY HAD STOPPED TO FEED AND REST THOSE WHO HUNTED IN THE WATER DID SO VERY QUIETLY A CRANE WOULD STAND ON ONE LEG WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST SO QUIETLY THAT ONE MIGHT THINK HIM ASLEEP BUT AS SOON AS ANYTHING EATABLE CAME NEAR
8419-286667-0006 THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
8419-286667-0007 WHILE THEY TRUMPETED OR CALLED OUT GOOD BYE STOP FOR US IN THE FALL THE FLYING CRANES TRUMPETED BACK WE WILL DON'T FORGET US THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT NEAR TOGETHER AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN WITH THE LARGE FLOCK
8419-286667-0009 AND THEIR LONG LEGS GAVE THEM A VERY GENTEEL LOOK THE TOPS OF THEIR HEADS WERE COVERED WITH WARTY RED SKIN FROM WHICH GREW SHORT BLACK FEATHERS THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE HAIRS ONE MORNING WHEN THE CRANES AWAKENED
8419-286667-0010 A FINE YOUNG FELLOW BEGAN TO STRUT UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE REST BOWING LOW AND LEAPING HIGH INTO THE AIR AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WHOOPING AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD THE GULLS WHO HAD SPENT THE WINTER BY THE POND SCREAMED TO EACH OTHER THE CRANE DANCE HAS BEGUN
8419-286667-0012 EVERY CRANE DANCED BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL AND AS THEY DID SO THEY LOOKED LOVINGLY AT EACH OTHER AND ADMIRED THE FINE STEPS AND ENJOYED THE WHOOPING THIS WENT ON UNTIL THEY WERE SO TIRED THEY COULD HARDLY STAND AND HAD TO STOP TO EAT AND REST
8419-286667-0013 WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
8419-286667-0015 I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU AND HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY IT WAS JUST FOR A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED
8419-286667-0016 THEN THEY STOOD AND FISHED FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHEN SHE FLEW AWAY SHE SAID THAT IS A VERY PLEASANT FISHING PLACE HE STOOD ON THE OTHER LEG FOR A WHILE AND THOUGHT HOW SWEET HER VOICE SOUNDED AS SHE SAID IT
8419-286667-0018 HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
8419-286667-0019 AS SHE STALKED OFF TOWARD THE POND SHE PASSED HIM AND SHE SAID OVER HER SHOULDER I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE HUNGRY I AM ALMOST STARVED AFTER SHE HAD GONE HE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD SAID THAT
8419-286667-0021 STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
8419-286667-0022 HE PITIED SHORT NECKED PEOPLE THEN HE SAID POOH I CAN TAKE BIGGER MOUTHFULS THAN THAT YOU OUGHT TO SEE WHAT BIG MOUTHFULS I CAN TAKE SHE CHANGED AND STOOD ON HER OTHER LEG I SAW YOU DANCING THIS MORNING SHE SAID
8419-286667-0024 WHEN A CRANE IS AS MUCH EXCITED AS THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS TO MY SISTER SHE ASKED CARELESSLY AS SHE DREW ONE OF HER LONG TAIL FEATHERS THROUGH HER BEAK NO SAID HE I BOWED TO HER SISTER
8419-286667-0025 AND SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT SHE NEVER COULD REMEMBER WHAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IT MADE HIM FEEL VERY BADLY TO HAVE HER LEAVE HIM SO HE WANTED A CHANCE TO TELL HER SOMETHING YET WHENEVER HE TRIED TO IT SEEMED TO STICK IN HIS BILL HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM
8419-286667-0027 LET US GO OFF INTO THE WOODS AND REST YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WAS GLAD TO GO AND AS HE STALKED OFF WITH HER HE LED THE WAY TO A CHARMING NESTING PLACE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW TO TELL WHAT HE WANTED TO BUT HE HAD SEEN ANOTHER CRANE BOWING TO HER
8419-286667-0028 AND WAS AFRAID SHE MIGHT MARRY HIM IF HE WAS NOT QUICK NOW HE POINTED WITH ONE WING TO THIS NESTING PLACE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUILD A NEST THERE SHE LOOKED WHERE HE HAD POINTED I SHE SAID WHY
8419-286667-0030 WHEN DID YOU THINK OF IT SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND MISSUS SAND HILL CRANE OFTEN TOLD HER FRIENDS AFTERWARD THAT MISTER CRANE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT SHE JUST HAD TO MARRY HIM THEY WERE VERY VERY HAPPY AND AFTER A WHILE
8419-286676-0000 THE CLEVER WATER ADDER NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE WERE ALONE MORE THAN THE WATER ADDERS THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE AND BELOSTOMA DROVE AWAY THE BOYS AFTER THAT
8419-286676-0002 AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
8419-286676-0003 AFTER THAT I SHALL FLY AWAY ON MY WEDDING TRIP MISSUS BELOSTOMA MAY GO WITH ME IF SHE FEELS LIKE DOING SO AFTER LAYING HER EGGS HERE I SHALL GO ANYWAY AND I SHALL FLUTTER AND SPRAWL AROUND THE LIGHT AND STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHER ME AND HAVE A HAPPY TIME
8419-286676-0005 YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
8419-286676-0006 THEY HAD SUCH UGLY MOUTHS AND SUCH QUICK MOTIONS THE LARGER FISHES KEPT AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE SMALL AND TENDER ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE SAND HILL CRANES THE FISH HAWKS AND THE OTHER SHORE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY CALLED
8419-286676-0008 I WISH SAID HE THAT THE CHILLY FEELING WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO WAY THROUGH TO THEIR BELLIES THEIR BELLIES ARE ONLY THE FRONT SIDE OF THEIR BACKS ANYWAY HE ADDED BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THIN OF COURSE THIS WAS A DREADFUL WISH TO MAKE
8419-286676-0009 BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
8419-286676-0011 CATCH HOLD OF THINGS WITH HER TAIL HANG HERSELF FROM THE BRANCH OF A TREE LIFT HER HEAD FAR INTO THE AIR LEAP DART BOUND AND DIVE ALL HER FAMILY COULD DO THESE THINGS BUT SHE COULD DO THEM A LITTLE THE BEST ONE DAY SHE WAS HANGING OVER THE POND IN A VERY GRACEFUL POSITION
8419-286676-0012 WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
8419-286676-0014 YOU SEE SHE WAS VAIN AS WELL AS CLEVER THE SNAPPING TURTLE FELT CROSS TO DAY AND HAD COME TO SEE IF A TALK WITH HER WOULD NOT MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER THE MUD TURTLE WAS TIRED OF HAVING THE CHILDREN SPRAWL AROUND HIM
8419-286676-0015 AND OF MISSUS MUD TURTLE TELLING ABOUT THE TROUBLE SHE HAD TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF FOOD THE CLEVER WATER ADDER SPOKE FIRST OF THE WEATHER IT MUST BE DREADFULLY HOT FOR THE SHORE PEOPLE SHE SAID
8419-286676-0017 LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
8419-286676-0018 THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
8419-286676-0020 ASKED THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND HE WAS SNAPPY ABOUT IT OH NOTHING REPLIED THE WATER ADDER SWINGING HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH AND LOOKING AT THE SCALES ON HER BODY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0021 AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING AND IF I AM SWIMMING UNDER THE WATER AND A DUCKLING PADDLES ALONG JUST ABOVE ME AND STICKS HIS FOOT INTO MY MOUTH I AM LIKELY TO SWALLOW HIM BEFORE I THINK THE WATER ADDER SAW THAT HE WAS PROVOKED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID SO SHE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
8419-286676-0023 I NEVER WORRY ABOUT MINE SAID THE MUD TURTLE ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER THINKS IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM ALL TO SLEEP AT ONCE AS THEY DO ON A LOG IN THE SUNSHINE IT ISN'T SAID THE ADDER DECIDEDLY I NEVER CLOSE MY EYES
8419-286676-0024 MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
8419-286676-0026 OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
8419-286676-0027 TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
8419-286676-0029 IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY TAIL WITH MY HEAD OR EVEN WITH ONE OF MY HIND FEET
8419-286676-0030 ASKED THE WATER ADDER IN HER SWEETEST VOICE NOTHING IS EASIER AND SHE WOUND HERSELF AROUND THE WILLOW BRANCH IN ANOTHER GRACEFUL POSITION AND TOOK THE TIP OF HER TAIL DAINTILY BETWEEN HER TEETH HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0032 SAID THE MUD TURTLE AND HE SWAM AWAY WITH THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT A RUDE PERSON SHE IS THEY SAID ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE CLEVER SHE IS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD RATHER BE STUPID AND POLITE AFTER A WHILE THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAID
8419-286676-0033 BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
8419-293469-0001 ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF WHICH HE TOLD HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME TO THE MEADOW
8419-293469-0002 NONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN HIM THEN BUT HE WAS AN HONEST FELLOW AND THEY WERE SURE THAT EVERYTHING HE TOLD WAS TRUE BESIDES THEY MUST BE TRUE FOR HOW COULD A BODY EVER THINK OUT SUCH REMARKABLE TALES FROM HIS OWN HEAD
8419-293469-0004 ONE DAY WHEN MANY OF THE MEADOW PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID I WAS STRONG AND WELL AND COULD LEAP FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER FROG OF MY SIZE
8419-293469-0005 I WAS HATCHED IN THE POND BEYOND THE FARM HOUSE AND ATE MY WAY FROM THE EGG TO THE WATER OUTSIDE LIKE ANY OTHER FROG PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY LIKE ANY OTHER TADPOLE FOR OF COURSE I BEGAN LIFE AS A TADPOLE
8419-293469-0007 OH HOW HAPPY WE WERE THEN I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MY HIND LEGS BEGAN TO GROW AND HOW THE OTHER TADPOLES CROWDED AROUND ME IN THE WATER AND SWAM CLOSE TO ME TO FEEL THE TWO LITTLE BUNCHES THAT WERE TO BE LEGS
8419-293469-0008 MY FORE LEGS DID NOT GROW UNTIL LATER AND THESE BUNCHES CAME JUST IN FRONT OF MY TAIL YOUR TAIL CRIED A PUZZLED YOUNG CRICKET
8419-293469-0010 THE KNOBS ON THE ENDS OF MY TOES WERE STICKY SO THAT I COULD CLIMB A TREE AND THEN I WAS READY TO START ON MY TRAVELS SOME OF THE OTHER FROGS STARTED WITH ME BUT THEY STOPPED ALONG THE WAY AND AT LAST I WAS ALONE
8419-293469-0011 I WAS A BOLD YOUNG FELLOW AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THING AMONG THE TREES UP YONDER I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THERE WAS A GREAT RED THING IN THE YARD BESIDE IT BUT I LIKED THE WHITE ONE BETTER
8419-293469-0013 THE LARGEST CREATURES HAD FOUR LEGS AND SOME OF THEM HAD HORNS THE SMALLER CREATURES HAD ONLY TWO LEGS ON WHICH TO WALK AND TWO OTHER LIMBS OF SOME SORT WITH WHICH THEY LIFTED AND CARRIED THINGS
8419-293469-0014 THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SMALLER CREATURES SEEMED TO MAKE THE LARGER ONES DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY EVEN MADE SOME OF THEM HELP DO THEIR WORK YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
8419-293469-0016 THERE WERE SOME BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS NEAR THE HOUSE AND I CRAWLED IN AMONG THEM THERE I RESTED UNTIL SUNSET AND THEN BEGAN MY EVENING SONG WHILE I WAS SINGING ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND FOUND ME
8419-293469-0017 SHE PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME INSIDE OH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS MY HEART THUMPED AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND I TRIED MY BEST TO GET AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
8419-293469-0019 WONDERFUL INDEED AND AT THE TOP CONTINUED THE TREE FROG WAS SOMETHING WHITE OVER THE DOORWAY INTO MY PRISON IN THE BOTTOM WERE WATER AND A STONE AND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP WAS A LADDER
8419-293469-0020 I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN FREE CANNOT BE HAPPY SHUT IN I WATCHED MY CHANCE AND THREE TIMES I GOT OUT WHEN THE LITTLE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED TWICE I WAS CAUGHT AND PUT BACK
8419-293469-0022 AND I COULD HEAR A ROARING SOUND WHICH MEANT THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT
8419-293469-0023 AFTER THEY STOPPED HUNTING THE WIND BLEW THE DOOR OPEN AND I HOPPED OUT YOU DON'T SAY EXCLAIMED A GRASSHOPPER
8419-293469-0025 IT MAKES MY SKIN DRY TO THINK OF IT NOW AND FRIENDS THE BEST WAY I CAN EVER REPAY YOUR KINDNESS TO ME IS TO TELL YOU TO NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GO NEAR THE FARM HOUSE AND THEY ALL ANSWERED
8419-293473-0000 THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
8419-293473-0002 THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
8419-293473-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
8419-293473-0005 DO YOU NEVER FIX A PLACE FOR YOUR EGGS A PLACE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK WAVING HER LONG AND SLENDER FEELERS TO AND FRO A PLACE OH NO I THINK THEY WILL HATCH WHERE THEY ARE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND A PLACE
8419-293473-0006 SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
8419-293473-0008 THE SAME LONG FEELERS AND THE SAME SORT OF LONG SLENDER LEGS IF YOU HAD PASSED THEM IN A HAY FIELD YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE THOUGHT EACH A STEM OF HAY UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO SEE THEM MOVE THE OTHER WALKING STICK THEIR FRIEND WAS YOUNGER AND GREEN
8419-293473-0009 HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
8419-293473-0011 OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
8419-293473-0012 AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
8419-293473-0014 THE ANTS WERE SCRAMBLING AROUND AS BUSY AS EVER AND LIFE WENT ON QUITE AS THOUGH NEITHER MEN NOR HORSES HAD EVER ENTERED THE MEADOW SEE CRIED A SPIDER WHO WAS BUSILY LOOKING AFTER HER WEB THERE COMES A HORSE DRAWING SOMETHING AND THE FARMER SITTING ON IT AND DRIVING
8419-293473-0015 WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE
8419-293473-0017 AND WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IF SHE HAD TURNED BROWN AH SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK WHAT SCRAMBLING HOW VERY COMMON YES INDEED SAID HIS SISTER WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND GRACEFULLY
8419-293473-0018 PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
8419-293473-0020 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
8425-246962-0000 BEFORE THE MORNING LEOPOLD LAY WOUND IN THE NET OF A LOW FEVER ALMOST AS ILL AS EVER BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR LESS TROUBLED AND THAT EVEN HIS MOST RESTLESS DREAMS
8425-246962-0002 TALKING FACE TO FACE WITH JESUS
8425-246962-0003 WAS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTY FOR HELEN HERSELF SHE WAS PREY TO A HOST OF CHANGEFUL EMOTIONS AT ONE TIME SHE ACCUSED HERSELF BITTERLY OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE RETURN OF HIS ILLNESS
8425-246962-0005 FOR GEORGE'S MANIPULATION OF THE MAGISTRATE COULD BUT DELAY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH EVEN SHOULD NO DISCOVERY BE MADE LEOPOLD MUST AT LENGTH SUSPECT A TRICK AND THAT WOULD AT ONCE DRIVE HIM TO FRESH ACTION
8425-246962-0006 BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
8425-246962-0008 WHILE SHE FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF SHAME AND PITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF HAD PURSUED A COURSE WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD AT BEST HAVE RESULTED IN SHUTTING HIM UP AS IN A MADHOUSE
8425-246962-0009 WITH HIS OWN INBORN HORRORS WITH VAIN REMORSE AND EQUALLY VAIN LONGING HER CONSCIENCE NOW THAT HER MIND WAS QUIETER FROM THE GREATER DISTANCE TO WHICH THE THREATENING PERIL HAD AGAIN WITHDRAWN
8425-246962-0011 AND WHILE SHE FEARED AND SHRANK FROM THE SEVERITY OF WINGFOLD SHE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN INDISCRIBABLE SENSE OF SAFETY IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST SO LONG AS LEOPOLD WAS TOO ILL TO TALK FOR THE CURATE
8425-246962-0012 HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN THE WOMAN WHO COULD LOVE SO STRONGLY AND YET NOT ENTIRELY WHO SUFFERED AND MUST STILL SUFFER SO MUCH AND WHO A FAITH EVEN NO GREATER THAN HIS OWN MIGHT RENDER COMPARATIVELY BLESSED
8425-246962-0014 HE CAN SAY THENCE OPEN FACED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND THE PERSON IN NEED THEREOF MAY HEAR IT WITHOUT UMBRAGE OR THE CHOKING HUSK OF INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IRRITATING TO THE REJECTION OF WHAT TRUTH MAY LIE IN IT FOR HIM
8425-246962-0015 THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
8425-246962-0017 IS IT AN INFIRMITY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEN OR A WISE PROVISION FOR THEIR PROTECTION THAT THE BRIGHTEST FORMS THE TRUTH TAKES IN THEIR PRIVATE COGITATIONS SEEM TO LOSE HALF THEIR LUSTRE
8425-246962-0018 AND ALL THEIR GRACE WHEN UTTERED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNRECEPTIVE NATURE AND THEY HEAR AS IT WERE THEIR OWN VOICE REFLECTED IN A POOR DULL INHARMONIOUS ECHO AND ARE DISGUSTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
8425-246962-0020 WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0021 HAD HE NOT GONE FARTHER THAN HIS RIGHT HAD HE NOT IMPLIED MORE CONVICTION THAN WAS HIS WORDS COULD NOT GO BEYOND HIS SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OR THE HOPES FOR THE RANGE OF HIS
8425-246962-0023 EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY BY THE DELIGHT OF HIS HEART AS TO GIVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION IT MATTERED LITTLE WHAT WAS IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHAT HE BELIEVED OR HOW HE BELIEVED IF HE HAD NOT BEEN UNTRUE TO HIMSELF
8425-246962-0024 NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
8425-246962-0026 BUT TO THE TRUTH TO THE LOVELINESS AND HARMONY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SAFETY THAT HE SAW IN THE IDEA OF THE SON OF MAN AS HE READ IT IN THE STORY HE DARED NOT SAY WHAT IN A TIME OF PERSECUTION TORTURE MIGHT WORK UPON HIM
8425-246962-0027 BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-246962-0029 AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-246962-0030 HE HAD MUCH TIME FOR REFLECTION AS HE SAT SILENT BY THE BEDSIDE OF LEOPOLD SOMETIMES HELEN WOULD BE SITTING NEAR THOUGH GENERALLY WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE WENT OUT FOR HER WALK BUT NEVER ANYTHING CAME TO HIM HE COULD UTTER TO HER
8425-287387-0001 IN THE LITTLE SHOPS ALONG THE TIBER OR IN THE MERCATO DEI FIORI THAT WAS HIS PASSION TO HUNT THROUGH ROME FOR A PANEL OF AN OLD TRIPTYCH OR A FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT SCULPTURE
8425-287387-0002 IN THIS WAY HIS STUDIO HAD NOT REMAINED THE LARGE CHILLY VAULT LIKE WORKROOM BEARING WITNESS TO ZEALOUS AND SERIOUS STUDY BUT HAD BECOME A REFUGE FOR DIM COLOURED REMNANTS OF ANTIQUITY
8425-287387-0004 HE SPENT ALL HIS POCKET MONEY ON IT AND LATER WITHOUT RESERVE THE LITTLE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EARN FOR SOMETIMES VERY SELDOM HE WOULD FINISH SOMETHING AND SELL IT
8425-287387-0005 WHEN HE HAD THE MONEY TO KEEP HIMSELF GOING AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS WERE VERY SMALL HE FELT RICH AND WAS CONTENT IN HIS STUDIO OR WOULD WANDER PERFECTLY CONTENT THROUGH THE STREETS OF ROME
8425-287387-0007 HE WOULD WANDER FOR HOURS THROUGH THE RUINS AND SEE IN A DAZZLING VISION OF PHANTOM COLUMNS ETHEREAL TEMPLES AND TRANSLUCENT MARBLE PALACES LOOMING UP IN A SHIMMERING SUNLIT TWILIGHT AND THE TOURISTS GOING BY WITH THEIR BAEDEKERS
8425-287387-0008 WHO PASSED THIS LONG LEAN YOUNG MAN SEATED CARELESSLY ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE OF SATURN WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN HIS ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSIONS OF HARMONIOUS ASCENDING LINES CROWNED BY AN ARRAY OF STATUES IN NOBLE
8425-287387-0010 THE TEMPLES ROSE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE BASILICAS SHOT UP AS BY MAGIC THE GRAVEN IMAGES STOOD WHITE AGAINST THE ELUSIVE DEPTHS OF THE SKY AND THE VIA SACRA BECAME ALIVE
8425-287387-0011 HE IN HIS ADMIRATION LIVED HIS DREAM HIS PAST IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD KNOWN PREEXISTENCE IN ANCIENT ROME AND THE MODERN HOUSES THE MODERN CAPITOL
8425-287387-0013 EATEN UP WITH AGE CRUMBLED MARTYRED MUTILATED WITH HAMMERS TILL ONLY A FEW OCCASIONAL PILLARS LIFTED AND BORE A TREMBLING ARCHITRAVE THAT THREATENED TO COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND
8425-287387-0014 AND THE BROWNS AND GREYS WERE SO RICHLY AND NOBLY GILDED BY SPLASHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RUINS WERE SO EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL IN DECAY SO MELANCHOLY IN THEIR UNWITTING FORTUITOUSNESS OF BROKEN LINES
8425-287387-0016 AND HE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS BY THE COLOSSEUM THROUGH THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE
8425-287387-0017 NEITHER IN HIS MOTHER NOR IN HIS SISTERS DID HE FIND A STRAIN THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS ECCENTRIC TENDENCIES AND SINCE THAT ONE FRIEND WHO DIED HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANOTHER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN LONELY WITHIN
8425-287387-0019 AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
8425-287387-0020 ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
8425-287387-0022 AND THE OLD LEATHER BINDINGS OF HIS BOOKS STOOD IN COMFORTABLE BROWN ROWS READY TO GIVE FORTH WHEN HIS HANDS OPENED THEM IMAGES WHICH MISTILY DRIFTED UPWARDS LIVING THEIR LOVES AND THEIR SORROWS IN THE TEMPERED BROWNS AND REDS AND GOLDS
8425-287387-0023 OF THE SOUNDLESS ATMOSPHERE OF THE STUDIO SUCH WAS HIS SIMPLE LIFE WITHOUT MUCH INWARD DOUBTING BECAUSE HE MADE NO GREAT DEMANDS UPON HIMSELF AND WITHOUT THE MODERN ARTIST'S MELANCHOLY
8425-287387-0025 HALF COSMOPOLITAN SET OF HIS RATHER WORLDLY MOTHER AND SMART LITTLE SISTERS WHO SPENT THEIR TIME DANCING AND CYCLING WITH YOUNG ITALIAN PRINCES AND DUKES
8425-287387-0026 AND AGAIN UNTIL IN HIS MUSING HE SEEMED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE ON HER OWN LIPS UNTIL SHE JOINED THE BUSTS AND TORSOS IN HIS STUDIO AND APPEARED BEFORE HIM IN THE LILY LIKE FRAILNESS OF HER VISIBLE ACTUALITY
8425-287387-0028 HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN MORE THAN THE NATURAL VIRILE IMPULSE AND THE ORDINARY LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR WITH A MODEL
8425-287387-0029 AND UNREAL BALANCE BETWEEN A WOMAN WHO SHOWED HERSELF IN THE NUDE FOR A FEW LIRE AND PETRARCH'S LAURA
8425-287387-0031 AND DREAMED FOR DAYS FOR A WEEK ABOUT A WOMAN IN A POEM
8425-287387-0032 NEVER AND THAT HE IRRITATED BY SOME OF HER SAYINGS HAD NEVERTHELESS SEEN HER STAND WITH HER LILY LIKE OUTLINE
8425-291444-0001 WHO SERVE AS THE TOTTERING MONUMENTS OF GOOD OLD TIMES WILL BE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN ENGROSSED BY THE EMPTY PLEASURES OR INSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT AGE WILL NEGLECT TO TREASURE UP THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST
8425-291444-0002 AND POSTERITY WILL SEARCH IN VAIN FOR MEMORIALS OF THE DAYS OF THE PATRIARCHS THE ORIGIN OF OUR CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ETERNAL OBLIVION AND EVEN THE NAMES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER
8425-291444-0004 OR OF ITS THREE FIRST DUTCH GOVERNORS I HAVE HOWEVER GAINED MUCH VALUABLE AND CURIOUS MATTER FROM AN ELABORATE MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN
8425-291444-0005 EXCEPTING A FEW ERRORS IN ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE STUYVESANT FAMILY MANY LEGENDS LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HAVE I LIKEWISE GLEANED IN MY RESEARCHES AMONG THE FAMILY CHESTS AND LUMBER GARRETS OF OUR RESPECTABLE
8425-291444-0007 AND THE STRICTEST ADHERENCE TO TRUTH THROUGHOUT MY HISTORY I HAVE ENRICHED IT AFTER THE MANNER OF SALLUST WITH VARIOUS CHARACTERS OF ANCIENT WORTHIES DRAWN AT FULL LENGTH AND FAITHFULLY COLORED
8425-291444-0008 SWEETENED IT WITH THE GRACES OF SENTIMENT LIKE TACITUS AND INFUSED INTO THE WHOLE THE DIGNITY THE GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE OF LIVY I AM AWARE THAT I SHALL INCUR THE CENSURE OF NUMEROUS VERY LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS CRITICS FOR
8425-291444-0010 YET THE LOOSE AND UNCONNECTED MANNER IN WHICH MANY OF THE FACTS HEREIN RECORDED HAVE COME TO HAND RENDERED SUCH AN ATTEMPT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THIS DIFFICULTY WAS LIKEWISE INCREASED BY ONE OF THE GRAND OBJECTS CONTEMPLATED IN MY WORK
8425-291444-0011 BUT THE CHIEF MERIT ON WHICH I VALUE MYSELF AND FOUND MY HOPES FOR FUTURE REGARD IS THAT FAITHFUL VERACITY WITH WHICH I HAVE COMPILED THIS INVALUABLE LITTLE WORK
8425-291444-0013 THE INFANT YEARS OF OUR CITY TO INTRODUCE A THOUSAND PLEASING FICTIONS BUT I HAVE SCRUPULOUSLY DISCARDED MANY A PITHY TALE AND MARVELOUS ADVENTURE WHEREBY THE DROWSY EAR OF SUMMER INDOLENCE MIGHT BE ENTHRALLED
8425-291444-0014 JEALOUSLY MAINTAINING THAT FIDELITY GRAVITY AND DIGNITY WHICH SHOULD EVER DISTINGUISH THE HISTORIAN FOR A WRITER OF THIS CLASS OBSERVES AN ELEGANT CRITIC MUST SUSTAIN THE CHARACTER OF A WISE MAN WRITING FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POSTERITY
8425-291444-0016 TO TRANSMIT THEIR RENOWN TO ALL SUCCEEDING AGES WHAT HAS BEEN THE FATE OF MANY FAIR CITIES OF ANTIQUITY WHOSE NAMELESS RUINS ENCUMBER THE PLAINS OF EUROPE AND ASIA AND AWAKEN THE FRUITLESS INQUIRY OF THE TRAVELER
8425-291444-0017 THEY HAVE PERISHED FROM REMEMBRANCE FOR WANT OF A HISTORIAN THE PHILANTHROPIST MAY WEEP OVER THEIR DESOLATION THE POET MAY WANDER AMONG THEIR MOULDERING ARCHES AND BROKEN COLUMNS
8425-291444-0019 REUNITE THE THREAD OF GENERATIONS THE SAME SAD MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY ANCIENT CITIES WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND FROM THE SAME SAD CAUSE TO NINE TENTHS OF THOSE WHICH NOW FLOURISH ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
8425-292520-0000 THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH
8425-292520-0002 DARK WITH CRUMBLING RAILING AND PLANKS THE BRIDGE LEADS INTO THE SUNSET ACROSS IT MANY LONELY FIGURES THEIR EYES A FLARE WITH THE SUNSET THEIR FACES GLOWING WITH ITS COLORS
8425-292520-0003 SALVATION ARMY A DRUM POUNDS OUT THE HYMN LOUD WITH GAUDY ANGELS TINSEL CHERUBIM TO DROWN THE FANFARE OF THE STREET AND WITH EXULTANT LILTING BEAT
8425-292520-0005 BATHE IN GOD'S MERCY DRAW NEAR AND LEARN SALVATION SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THE MYSTERY CYMBALS AT THE HANDS OF A TIRED GIRL SLIM WISP AMID THE SWIRL OF CROWDED STREETS TAKE UP THE TUNE
8425-292520-0006 FACES ARE WAN IN THE ARC LIGHT'S LIVID GLARE A WIND GUST CARRIES THE BAND'S FLARE OF SONG
8425-292520-0008 AS I GO HASTILY BY IN THE TURBULENT DARKNESS AN OVAL OLIVE FACE WITH THE SWEETLY SULLEN GRACE OF THE VIRGIN WHEN FIRST SHE SEES AMID HER GARDEN'S SILVER LILIES THE WHITE ROBED ANGEL GLEAM
8425-292520-0009 AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE SMOKE AND DUST AGE OLD
8425-292520-0011 ALONG PAVEMENTS WHERE RAIN BEATS ITS SHARP TATTOO AND GAS LAMPS SHINE GREENISH GOLD IN THE SOLITUDE THE VISION FLAMES THROUGH MY MOOD OF THAT ITALIAN WOMAN'S FACE
8425-292520-0012 MEMORY BETWEEN ROUNDED HILLS WHITE WITH PATCHES OF BUCKWHEAT WHOSE FRAGRANCE FILLS THE LITTLE BREEZE THAT MAKES THE BIRCH LEAVES QUIVER BESIDE A ROLLICKING SWIFT RIVER
8425-292520-0014 AND THE MARGINAL LINE OF BIRCHES AND WILLOWS OUR LITTLE STEAMER PULLS ITS WAY WITH JINGLE OF BELLS AND PANTING THROB OF OLD ENGINES IN STIFF ARRAY THE WATER REEDS WAVE AND SOLEMNLY SWAY TO THE WASH AND SWELL OF OUR PASSING
8425-292520-0015 AMONG THE REEDS THE RIPPLES SOB AND DIE AWAY TILL THE CANAL IS STILL AGAIN
8425-292520-0017 EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION YOU SMILED WHEN I POINTED WHERE A GROUP OF BIRCHES SHIVERED IN THE GREEN WOOD SHADOW UP TO THEIR KNEES IN WATER
8425-292520-0018 WHITE AND FAIR AS DRYADS BATHING A ROW OF FLAT WHITE HOUSES AND A WHARF GLIDED IN SIGHT THE HOARSE WHISTLE SHRIEKED FOR A LANDING BELLS JANGLED
8425-292520-0020 IN MEN'S HEARTS THE MAD GODS RISE AND FILL THE STREETS WITH REVELLING WITH TORCHLIGHT THAT GLANCES ON FROZEN POOLS WITH TAPERS STARRING THE THICK FOGGED NIGHT A DANCE LIKE STRAYED FIREFLIES
8425-292520-0021 TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND
8425-292520-0023 IS IT THE SONG OF A MEADOW LARK OFF THE BROWN SERE SALT MARSHES OR THE EAGER PATCHES IN DOORYARDS OF YELLOW AND PALE LILAC CROCUSES
8425-292520-0024 RHYTHMED CLANK OF TRAIN COUPLINGS AT NIGHT AND THE STORMY GAY TINTED SUNRISES THAT SHADE WITH PURPLE THE CONTOURS OF FAR OFF UNFAMILIAR HILLS NIGHT PIECE
8425-292520-0026 THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON
8425-292520-0027 BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS OH THE HOARSE HALF HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
8425-292520-0029 DOWN THE WORN OUT YEARS A SOB OF BROKEN LOVES OLD PAIN OF DEAD FAREWELLS AND ONE FACE FADING INTO GREY A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB OVER ALL THE SKY
8465-246940-0000 IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE EITHER OF THEM SPOKE AND IT DID NOT HELP WINGFOLD THAT SHE SAT CLOUDED BY A DARK COLOURED VEIL AT LENGTH HE SAID YOU MUST NOT FEAR TO TRUST ME BECAUSE I DOUBT MY ABILITY TO HELP YOU I CAN AT LEAST ASSURE YOU OF MY SYMPATHY
8465-246940-0002 AND THERE THE DOCTOR IS THE BEST HELP HELEN SHOOK HER HEAD AND SMILED BEHIND HER VEIL A GRIEVOUS SMILE THE CURATE PAUSED BUT RECEIVING NO ASSISTANCE VENTURED ON AGAIN IF IT BE A THOUGHT OF SOMETHING PAST AND GONE
8465-246940-0003 FOR WHICH NOTHING CAN BE DONE I THINK ACTIVITY IN ONE'S DAILY WORK MUST BE THE BEST AID TO ENDURANCE OH DEAR OH DEAR SIGHED HELEN WHEN ONE HAS NO HEART TO ENDURE AND HATES THE VERY SUNLIGHT
8465-246940-0005 THEN GIVE ME SOME FOOD SOME HOPE I MEAN AND TRY ME AGAIN WITHOUT THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT DUTY OR LIFE OR ANYTHING TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
8465-246940-0006 I MAY BE ABLE TO HINT AT SOME HOPE SAID WINGFOLD VERY GENTLY DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN THE QUESTION WOULD TO MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE ABRUPT INQUISITORIAL BUT TO HELEN IT SOUNDED NOT ONE OF THEM ALL
8465-246940-0008 MIGHT IT NOT BE WELL HOWEVER TO TRY IF THERE IS ANY TO BE HAD FROM HIM THAT SAID COME UNTO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST I CAN DO NOTHING WITH THAT I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO PRAY BUT IT IS OF NO USE
8465-246940-0009 I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYONE HEARING A WORD I SAY YESTERDAY WHEN I GOT ALONE IN THE PARK I PRAYED ALOUD
8465-246940-0011 SHE TRIED HARD BUT COULD NOT PREVENT A SOB
8465-246940-0012 WILL YOU NOT TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT SAID THE CURATE YET MORE GENTLY
8465-246940-0014 POSSIBLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ARE NOT DOING AND THAT IS WHY YOU CANNOT REST I THINK JESUS WOULD GIVE NO REST EXCEPT IN THE WAY OF LEARNING OF HIM HELEN'S SOBS CEASED
8465-246940-0015 BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY
8465-246940-0017 HERE THE ANSWER WAS NOT SO PLAIN AND THE CURATE HAD TO THINK AT LEAST HE SAID AT LENGTH YOU COULD CONFESS THE WRONG AND ASK FORGIVENESS
8465-246940-0018 AGAIN THE CURATE TOOK TIME TO REPLY I AM ENDEAVOURING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS I CAN HE SAID BUT IT IS HARD TO DEAL WITH GENERALITIES
8465-246940-0020 FOR SURELY THERE CANNOT BE ANY OTHER KIND OF GOD THAN THE FATHER OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246940-0021 THEREFORE SURELY THE FIRST STEP FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COMMITTED SUCH A CRIME MUST BE TO HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE GOD CONFESS THE SIN AND ASK FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING
8465-246940-0023 THEN YOU THINK CONFESSION TO GOD IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IF THERE BE NO ONE ELSE WRONGED TO WHOM CONFESSION CAN BE MADE IF THE CASE WERE MINE
8465-246940-0024 AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
8465-246940-0026 SHE HAD GONE MUCH FARTHER THAN SHE HAD INTENDED BUT THE MORE DOUBTFUL HELP BECAME THE MORE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY THE AGONY OF A PERISHING HOPE TO SEARCH THE HEART OF WINGFOLD AGAIN THE CURATE PONDERED ARE YOU SURE HE SAID AT LENGTH
8465-246940-0027 THAT THE PERSON OF WHOM YOU SPEAK IS NOT NEGLECTING SOMETHING HE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING HE KNOWS PERHAPS HE HAD COME BACK TO THE SAME WITH WHICH HE STARTED THROUGH HER VEIL HE SAW HER TURN DEADLY WHITE
8465-246940-0029 I KNOW THAT SO LONG AS WE HANG BACK FROM DOING WHAT CONSCIENCE URGES THERE IS NO PEACE FOR US I WILL NOT SAY OUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HEARD FOR MISTER POLWARTH HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THE MOST PRECIOUS ANSWER PRAYER CAN HAVE
8465-246940-0030 LIES IN THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE TOWARDS THE DREADED DUTY AND IN THE EVER SHARPER STINGS OF THE CONSCIENCE I THINK I ASKED ALREADY WHETHER THERE WERE NO RELATIVES TO WHOM REPARATION COULD BE MADE YES YES GASPED HELEN
8465-246942-0000 SHE HAD SOUGHT THE DOOR OF PARADISE AND THE DOOR OF HELL HAD BEEN OPENED TO HER IF THE FRIGHTFUL IDEA WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT HAD ALREADY SUGGESTED ITSELF TO LEOPOLD SHOULD NOW BE ENCOURAGED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK MADNESS BEFORE HER
8465-246942-0001 HER POLDIE ON THE SCAFFOLD GOD IN HEAVEN INFINITELY RATHER WOULD SHE POISON HERSELF AND HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW PLEASED AND CONSOLED HE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR DYING TOGETHER AND THAT REASSURED HER A LITTLE
8465-246942-0003 HELEN'S ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF GUILT CAME FROM THE PALE IMAGE OF IT LIFTED ABOVE HER HORIZON BY THE REFRACTION OF HER SYMPATHY SHE DID NOT KNOW PERHAPS NEVER WOULD UNDERSTAND THE GHASTLY HORROR OF CONSCIOUS GUILT BESIDES WHICH THERE IS NO EVIL ELSE
8465-246942-0004 AGONIES OF INJURY A MAN MAY ENDURE AND SO FAR FROM BEING OVERWHELMED RISE ABOVE THEM TENFOLD A MAN WHO WERE HE TO AWAKE TO THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF A CRIME WOULD SINK INTO A HEAP OF RUIN
8465-246942-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0007 AND SOME KIND OF REFUGE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STRANGE IT IS AND TRUE THAT IN PUBLICITY ITSELF LIES SOME RELIEF FROM THE GNAWING OF THE WORM AS IF EVEN A CURSING HUMANITY WERE A BARRIER OF PROTECTION BETWEEN THE TORN SOUL AND ITS CRIME
8465-246942-0009 IS IT THAT THE CRIME SEEMS THEN LIFTED A LITTLE FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND ITS WEIGHT SHARED BY THE ACE HELEN HAD HOPED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IN PUBLIC SO TENDERLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SO POWERFULLY OF THE SAVING HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
8465-246942-0010 THAT WOULD HAVE NO DIVISIONS OF PRIDE NO SCATTERINGS OF HATE
8465-246942-0012 AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT AFTER ALL THERE WAS YET A PLACE FOR HIM IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT HE WAS NO OUTCAST OF GEHENNA BUT INSTEAD OF SUCH WORDS OF GENTLE MIGHT LIKE THOSE OF THE MAN OF WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF TALKING
8465-246942-0013 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0015 IF LEOPOLD HAD HAD HER MOTHER FOR HIS TOO INSTEAD OF THE DARK SKINNED WOMAN WITH THE FLASHING EYES HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON THEM IT WAS ALL HIS MOTHER'S FAULT THE FAULT OF HER RACE AND OF THE HORRIBLE DRUG HER PEOPLE HAD TAUGHT HIM TO TAKE
8465-246942-0016 AND WAS HE TO GO AND CONFESS IT AND BE TRIED FOR IT AND BE GREAT GOD AND HERE WAS THE PRIEST ACTUALLY COUNSELLING WHAT WAS WORSE THAN ANY SUICIDE
8465-246942-0018 AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
8465-246942-0019 BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
8465-246942-0021 ALAS ALAS SHE WAS ALONE ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE GREAT WASTE DEATH EYED UNIVERSE BUT FOR A MAN TO TALK SO OF THE TENDERNESS OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246942-0022 AND THEN SERVE HER AS THE CURATE HAD DONE IT WAS INDEED SHAMELESS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TREATED A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND AS SHE SAID THUS TO HERSELF AGAIN THE WORDS SOUNDED IN THE EAR OF HER HEART
8465-246942-0024 KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
8465-246942-0025 BUT WHAT MATTER WHERE THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID THEM SO LONG AS THE WORDS WERE TRUE AND SHE MIGHT BELIEVE THEM WHATEVER IS TRUE CAN BE BELIEVED OF THE TRUE HEART ERE SHE KNEW
8465-246942-0027 INSTEAD OF ANY WORD OR THOUGHT EVEN COMING TO HER THAT MIGHT BE FANCIED AN ANSWER SHE WAS SCARED FROM HER KNEES BY AN APPROACHING STEP
8465-246943-0000 HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
8465-246943-0002 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
8465-246943-0003 WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
8465-246943-0005 WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
8465-246943-0006 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0008 I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU SHE SAID STILL STOOPING AND SHE FELT LIKE A DEVIL DRAGGING THE SOUL OF HER BROTHER TO HELL BUT THAT WAS A FOOLISH FANCY AND MUST BE RESISTED
8465-246943-0009 NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
8465-246943-0011 WHETHER IN THE FRESH HORROR THAT DAY POURED INTO THE CUP THAT HAD SEEMED ALREADY RUNNING OVER IT WAS OF HER BROTHER ONLY SHE THOUGHT OR WHETHER THREATENED SHAME TO HERSELF HAD NOT A PART IN HER MISERY
8465-246943-0012 FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
8465-246943-0014 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG SHE THOUGHT
8465-246943-0015 APPARENTLY SENSELESS ON THE PILLOW AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD THE SAME MOMENT SHE WAS FREE THE HORROR HAD DEPARTED FROM HER OWN ATMOSPHERE TOO AND SHE MADE HASTE TO RESTORE HIM
8465-246943-0017 IF THE CRUEL POWER THAT HAD CREATED HIM FOR SUCH MISERY WHOEVER WHATEVER WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
8465-246943-0018 YET SHE HESITATED NOT A SINGLE MOMENT IN HER MINISTRATIONS THERE IS SO MUCH PASSES IN US OF WHICH OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TAKES NO GRASP OR BUT WITH SUCH A FLITTING TOUCH AS SCARCELY TO HAND IT OVER TO THE MEMORY
8465-246943-0020 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246943-0021 AT LENGTH LEOPOLD OPENED HIS EYES
8465-246943-0023 I KNOW WHAT FANCY IS AS WELL AS ANY MAN OR WOMAN BORN THAT WAS NO FANCY SHE STOOD THERE BY THE WARDROBE IN THE SAME DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS HER DRESS AND LISTEN I WILL TELL YOU
8465-246943-0024 I WILL SOON SATISFY YOU IT COULD BE NO FANCY HERE HE PUSHED HER FROM HIM AND LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER EYES I SAW HER BACK REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR OF THE WARDROBE DOOR AND
8465-246943-0026 UGH I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR HIS VOICE HAD RISEN TO A STRANGLED SHRIEK HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED
8465-246943-0027 IF INDEED THAT BE A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF COURAGE AND IT IS NOT GATHERED RATHER FROM THE HIDDEN HOPE OF WHICH I SPEAK AND THE LOVE THAT WILL CLEAVE AND NOT FORSAKE SHE SET HER TEETH AND SAID LET HER COME THEN POLDIE I AM WITH YOU AND I DEFY HER
8465-246943-0029 BUT LEOPOLD SEEMED NOT TO HEAR A WORD SHE SAID AND LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL
8465-246947-0000 AS WINGFOLD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH WAS NEAR THE STAIR HELEN ROSE FROM THE TOP OF IT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN WITH HER BROTHER HE CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM AND STEPPED SOFTLY ALONG THE LANDING
8465-246947-0002 BUT AT HIS HEAD STOOD ONE WHO WATCHED HIS THROES WITH THE THROBS OF SUCH A HUMAN HEART AS NEVER BEAT IN ANY BOSOM BUT HIS OWN AND THE EXECUTIONERS WERE ANGELS OF LIGHT NO WONDER IF WITH SUCH A FEELING IN HIS BREAST WINGFOLD WALKED SOFTLY AND HIS FACE GLISTENED
8465-246947-0003 HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES BUT HELEN SAW THEM YOU KNOW ALL SHE FALTERED I DO WILL YOU LET ME OUT BY THE GARDEN AGAIN I WISH TO BE ALONE SHE LED THE WAY DOWN THE STAIR
8465-246947-0005 I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
8465-246947-0006 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8465-246947-0008 THE TERROR OF HIS POSSIBLE COUNSEL FOR THE MOMENT VANISHED HE COULD NEVER TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP
8465-246947-0009 THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
8465-246947-0011 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0012 COULD IT BE THAT WINGFOLD'S BEARING HAD COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND A SHADOW OF THE AWE WITH WHICH HE HAD LEFT THE PLACE WHERE PERHAPS A SOUL WAS BEING BORN AGAIN LEOPOLD DID NOT MOVE TERROR LAID HOLD OF HER HEART
8465-246947-0014 WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
8465-246947-0015 I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
8465-246947-0017 THAT IS A GOOD FELLOW SUCH A GOOD FELLOW A PANG OF JEALOUSY THE FIRST SHE HAD EVER FELT SHOT TO HER HEART SHE HAD HITHERTO SINCE HIS TROUBLE BEEN ALL IN ALL TO HER LEOPOLD
8465-246947-0018 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8465-246947-0020 I KNOW THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOU RAN TO MEET ME AND TOOK ME IN YOUR ARMS AND KISSED ME I WAS AS IF I HAD CROSSED THE SEA OF DEATH AND FOUND PARADISE IN YOUR BOSOM I AM NOT LIKELY TO FORGET YOU FOR MISTER WINGFOLD
8465-246947-0021 GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
8465-246947-0023 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED LEOPOLD BUT THEN HE CAME TO ME WITH HIS DOOR OPEN AND LET ME WALK IN
8465-246947-0024 HE HASN'T GOT A SECRET LIKE US HELEN HE ADDED SADLY WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU MUCH WHAT HE SAID TO YOU FROM THE PULPIT THE OTHER DAY I SHOULD THINK THEN SHE WAS RIGHT FOR ALL HIS HARDNESS AND WANT OF SYMPATHY THE CURATE HAD YET HAD REGARD TO HER ENTREATIES
8465-246947-0026 NO I CAN'T SEE THE GOOD OF TAKING MORE PEOPLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE WHY SHOULD HE NOT DO WHAT HE THINKS BEST HELEN YOU DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE DOCTOR WHY SHOULD YOU WITH HIM WHEN A MAN IS GOING TO THE BOTTOM AS FAST AS HE CAN
8465-246947-0027 AND ANOTHER COMES DIVING AFTER HIM IT ISN'T FOR ME TO SAY HOW HE IS TO TAKE HOLD OF ME NO HELEN WHEN I TRUST I TRUST OUT AND OUT HELEN SIGHED THINKING HOW ILL THAT HAD WORKED WITH EMMELINE
8468-286673-0001 THE MOTHER TURTLE WHO WAS SUNNING HERSELF ON THE BANK NEAR BY SAID TO HER FRIENDS WHY THERE ARE MY CHILDREN DID YOU EVER SEE A FINER FAMILY I BELIEVE I WILL GO OVER AND SPEAK TO THEM
8468-286673-0002 AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL
8468-286673-0004 AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
8468-286673-0005 YOU CERTAINLY ARE FOR I SAW YOU SCRAMBLING OUT OF THE SAND A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND YOU CAME FROM THE VERY PLACE WHERE I LAID MY EGGS AND COVERED THEM DURING THE FIRST REALLY WARM NIGHTS THIS YEAR I WAS TELLING YOUR FATHER ONLY YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR YOU TO HATCH
8468-286673-0007 WHY ARE YOU NOT UP HERE WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE ASKED SUDDENLY OF THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR HIMSELF ON THE LOG THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME HE SAID I WAS COMING RIGHT ALONG BUT THEY WOULDN'T WAIT I THINK THEY ARE JUST AS MEA
8468-286673-0008 THE MOTHER TURTLE RAISED ONE OF HER FOREFEET UNTIL ALL FIVE OF ITS TOES WITH THEIR STRONG CLAWS WERE POINTING AT HIM SHE ALSO RAISED HER HEAD AS FAR AS HER UPPER SHELL WOULD LET HER SO YOU ARE THE ONE SHE SAID
8468-286673-0010 YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
8468-286673-0011 THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0013 AND THE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS LEFT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR RIGHT EYES HE DREW IN HIS HEAD AND HIS TAIL AND HIS LEGS UNTIL ALL THEY COULD SEE WAS HIS ROUNDED UPPER SHELL HIS SHELL SIDE WALLS AND THE YELLOW EDGE OF HIS FLAT LOWER SHELL
8468-286673-0014 I DID HOPE SAID THE MOTHER TURTLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE FAMILY WITHOUT SUCH A CHILD IN IT I CANNOT HELP LOVING EVEN A SLOW CHILD WHO IS CROSS IF HE IS HATCHED FROM ONE OF MY EGGS YET IT MAKES ME SAD VERY VERY SAD
8468-286673-0016 I REMEMBER SO WELL MY FIRST SLOW CHILD AND HOW HE SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SINCE SHE COULD NOT EASILY GET HER FOREFEET TO HER EYES SHE SPRAWLED TO THE POND AND SWAM OFF WITH ONLY HER HEAD AND A LITTLE OF HER UPPER SHELL SHOWING ABOVE THE WATER
8468-286673-0017 THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
8468-286673-0019 AND THESE COUSINS OF THE TURTLES LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THEM THAT SOME PEOPLE CANNOT TELL THEM APART THAT IS BECAUSE THEY FORGET THAT THE TORTOISES LIVE ON LAND HAVE HIGHER BACK SHELLS AND MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY TURTLES LIVE MORE IN THE WATER
8468-286673-0020 AND CAN MOVE QUICKLY IF THEY WILL THIS IS WHY OTHER TURTLES SOMETIMES MAKE FUN OF A SLOW BROTHER BY CALLING HIM A LAND TORTOISE ONE BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINY AFTERNOON WHEN MOST OF THE TWENTY LITTLE TURTLES WERE SITTING ON A FLOATING LOG BY THE EDGE OF THE POND
8468-286673-0022 SHE COULD SEE THEIR STRONG LITTLE POINTED TAILS TOO AND THEIR WEBBED FEET WITH A STOUT CLAW ON EACH TOE SHE WAS SO PROUD THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP TALKING ABOUT THEM
8468-286673-0023 YES SAID A FINE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS FLOATING NEAR HER A ROW OF THEIR MOTHERS HE WAS A TURTLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LIKED VERY WELL BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS RATHER AGREEABLE AFTER ALL
8468-286673-0025 AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0026 THEN ONE OF THESE GREAT ANIMALS STOOPED OVER AND PICKED HIM UP AND HELD HIM BOTTOM SIDE UPPERMOST AND RAPPED ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS FLAT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS ROUNDED AND STARED AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT EYES
8468-286673-0028 HE WAS THINKING OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND HE KNEW THAT BACK IN THE POND HIS MOTHER WOULD BE TRYING TO FIND HIM AND COULD NOT THE BOYS CARRIED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW AND PUT HIM DOWN ON THE GRASS
8468-286673-0029 HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
8468-286673-0031 THEN HE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HE WANTED SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO HIS HOME IN THE POND THAT HE STARTED AT ONCE BY MOONLIGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN THE MOON FOR EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE LAYING EGGS TURTLES USUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT
8468-286673-0032 I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
8468-286673-0034 AND AGAIN HE FELL FAST ASLEEP
8468-286673-0035 BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
8468-286673-0037 IF YOU WILL ONLY LEARN TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE SAID I SHALL NOT BE SORRY THAT THE BOYS CARRIED YOU OFF YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE SAID THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AFTER THAT
8468-286673-0038 HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
8468-286673-0040 AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-294887-0000 AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM
8468-294887-0002 THEY WENT OUT ALL OVER THE LAND AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIFFUSING MORE TRUTH PERHAPS ABOUT THE DREADFUL SYSTEM OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THAN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY HE ALSO AIDED IN ESTABLISHING SEVERAL PERIODICALS BRIMFUL OF ANTI SLAVERY TRUTH
8468-294887-0003 AMONG WHICH WERE THE ANTI SLAVERY RECORD THE EMANCIPATOR THE SLAVE'S FRIEND THE LATTER TO INDOCTRINATE THE CHILDREN IN ANTI SLAVERY THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ORIGINALLY BEGUN FOR THE SUPPORT OF A MISSION IN AFRICA
8468-294887-0005 THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY
8468-294887-0006 AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT AT FIRST WE SENT THEM TO CANADA BUT AFTER A WHILE SENT THEM ONLY TO SYRACUSE AND THE CENTRE OF THE STATE
8468-294887-0008 BUT HEARING THAT THERE WERE A FEW LOADED MUSKETS THERE THEY TOOK IT OUT IN THREATS BUT THEIR MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT WAS ALMOST OSTRACISED AT THIS TIME BY THE DRY GOODS MERCHANTS
8468-294887-0009 AND WHEN THEY DID SO REQUESTED PARTICULARLY THAT THE BUNDLES OR BOXES SHOULD NOT BE MARKED FROM A TAPPAN AND CO AS WAS CUSTOMARY SOUTHERN MERCHANTS ESPECIALLY AVOIDED THEM
8468-294887-0011 MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR
8468-294887-0012 WHICH WAS HELD IN BROOKLYN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH LATELY AFFLICTED BY DISEASE MISTER TAPPAN STILL LIVES IN THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HIS FACULTIES AND A GOOD MEASURE OF HEALTH
8468-294887-0014 INSTEAD STANDS UP IN ALL OUR SOUTHERN STATES THE FREEDMAN KNOWING HIS RIGHTS AND AS A RULE ENJOYING THEM ORIGINAL AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS WHO MET THE SCORN AND ODIUM THE IMPUTED SHAME AND OBLOQUY
8468-294887-0015 YE HAVE DONE IT UNTO ME ANTHONY LANE NEW YORK NOVEMBER EIGHTH EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE MISTER LANE MISTER TAPPAN'S PERSONAL FRIEND WHO LABORED WITH HIM IN THE ANTI SLAVERY CAUSE
8468-294887-0017 MISTER TAPPAN WAS THEREFORE REQUESTED TO FURNISH A FEW REMINISCENCES FROM HIS OWN STORE HOUSE WHICH HE KINDLY DID AS FOLLOWS
8468-294887-0018 MY DEAR SIR IN ANSWER TO YOUR REQUEST THAT I WOULD FURNISH AN ARTICLE FOR YOUR FORTHCOMING BOOK GIVING INCIDENTS WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE RELATING TO THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD I HAVE ALREADY APPRIZED YOU OF MY ILLNESS AND MY CONSEQUENT INABILITY
8468-294887-0020 WHICH MAY AFFORD YOU AND YOUR READERS SOME GRATIFICATION THESE FACTS I MUST GIVE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO DATE AS I WILL NOT TAX MY MEMORY WITH PERHAPS A VAIN ATTEMPT TO NARRATE THEM IN ORDER AS MENTIONED IN MY LIFE OF ARTHUR TAPPAN
8468-294887-0021 BUT REFLECTION CONVINCED THEM THAT IT WAS NOT ONLY RIGHT TO ASSIST MEN IN EFFORTS TO OBTAIN THEIR LIBERTY WHEN UNJUSTLY HELD IN BONDAGE BUT A DUTY ABOLITIONISTS WHITE AND COLORED BOTH IN SLAVE AND FREE STATES
8468-294887-0023 I RECOLLECT THAT ONE MORNING ON REACHING MY OFFICE THAT OF THE TREASURER OF THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION MY ASSISTANT TOLD ME THAT IN THE INNER ROOM WERE EIGHTEEN FUGITIVES MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAD ARRIVED THAT MORNING FROM THE SOUTH IN ONE COMPANY
8468-294887-0024 WHOM THEY HAD HIRED TO CONDUCT THEM WITHOUT THE LIMITS OF THE CITY IN THE EVENING WHEN THE POLICE FORCE WAS CHANGED THEY CAME THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY TO MY OFFICE
8468-294887-0026 A MISSUS MERCY SMITH BECKONED TO ME TO COME TO HER CLASS
8468-294887-0027 IN ANSWER TO MY INQUIRIES THIS GIRL TOLD ME THE NAME OF THE SOUTHERN CITY AND THE NAMES OF THE PERSONS WHO HAD HELD HER AS A SLAVE AND THE MODE OF HER ESCAPE ET CETERA I WAS WALKING NEAR THE WATER SHE SAID WHEN A WHITE SAILOR SPOKE TO ME
8468-294887-0029 MOST OF THE TEACHERS WERE WARM HEARTED ABOLITIONISTS AND THE WHOLE NUMBER TAUGHT IN THIS SCHOOL DURING THIS PERIOD WAS SEVEN OR EIGHT HUNDRED
8468-294887-0030 TO MY INQUIRY HAVE YOU PARENTS LIVING AND ALSO BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE REPLIED THERE IS NO CHILD BUT MYSELF WERE NOT YOUR PARENTS KIND TO YOU AND DID YOU NOT LOVE THEM YES I LOVE THEM VERY MUCH
8468-294887-0032 HE TOLD ME I SHOULD BE FREE ONE SUNDAY MORNING I RECEIVED A LETTER INFORMING ME THAT AN OFFICER BELONGING TO SAVANNAH GA HAD STARTED FOR NEW YORK IN PURSUIT OF TWO YOUNG MEN OF NINETEEN OR TWENTY
8468-294887-0033 AND WHO HAD ESCAPED AND WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN NEW YORK THE LETTER REQUESTED ME TO FIND THEM AND GIVE THEM WARNING AS THERE WAS NO TIME TO BE LOST I CONCLUDED TO GO OVER TO NEW YORK NOTWITHSTANDING THE DOUBTFULNESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FIND THEM IN SO LARGE A CITY
8468-294887-0035 I STATED MY ERRAND TO HIM WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE YOUNG MEN WHY SAID HE I MUST HAVE ONE OF THEM IN MY SCHOOL HE TOOK ME TO A CLASS WHERE I FOUND ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN TO WHOM I GAVE THE NEEDFUL INFORMATION
8468-294887-0036 OF SAVANNAH AND THAT HE HAD FIVE CHILDREN BY THE YOUNG MAN'S MOTHER WHO WAS HIS SLAVE ON HIS MARRIAGE TO A WHITE WOMAN HE SENT HIS FIVE COLORED CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHER TO AUCTION TO BE SOLD FOR CASH TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
8468-294887-0038 AND HE WARNED THE PEOPLE NOT TO BID FOR HIM FOR HE WOULD NO LONGER BE A SLAVE TO ANY MAN AND IF ANY ONE BOUGHT HIM HE WOULD LOSE HIS MONEY HE ADDED I THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO SAY THIS I THEN SPOKE TO THE CROWD
8468-294887-0039 MY FATHER SAID I HAS LONG BEEN ONE OF YOUR FIRST DOCTORS AND DO YOU THINK IT RIGHT FOR HIM TO SELL MY MOTHER AND HIS CHILDREN IN THIS WAY I WAS SOLD AND MY BROTHER ALSO AND THE REST ALTHOUGH MY BROTHER SAID TO THE CROWD WHAT I HAD SAID WE SOON MADE OUR ESCAPE
8468-294887-0041 THAT WITH THE AID OF A BROWN WIG AFTER HE HAD CUT OFF HIS HAIR HE WAS COMPLETELY DISGUISED HE SOON NOTIFIED HIS BROTHER WHO LIVED IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY AND BOTH PUT THEMSELVES OUT OF HARM'S WAY
8468-294887-0042 THEY WERE REMARKABLY FINE YOUNG MEN AND IT SEEMED A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE THAT I SHOULD FIND THEM IN SUCH A LARGE CITY AND DIRECT THEM TO ESCAPE FROM THEIR PURSUER WITHIN ONE HOUR AFTER I LEFT MY HOUSE IN BROOKLYN
8468-295198-0001 AND READY TO CAST HER ADVICE GRATIS AT EVERY BIRD AND BEAST OF THE WOODS NOW SHE BUSTLED UP TO THE PARSONAGE AT THE TOP OF THE OAK TREE TO TELL OLD PARSON TOO WHIT WHAT SHE THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO PREACH FOR HIS NEXT SERMON AND HOW DREADFUL THE MORALS OF THE PARISH WERE BECOMING
8468-295198-0002 THEN HAVING PERFECTLY BEWILDERED THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS SLEEPY OF A MONDAY MORNING MOTHER MAGPIE WOULD TAKE A PEEP INTO MISSUS ORIOLE'S NEST SIT CHATTERING ON A BOUGH ABOVE AND POUR FORTH FLOODS OF ADVICE
8468-295198-0004 NOW YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS THAT YOUR HEAD ACHES WHENEVER I CALL UPON YOU IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF SWINGING AND SWAYING ABOUT IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER BUT MY DEAR
8468-295198-0005 PIPED MISSUS ORIOLE TIMIDLY THE ORIOLES ALWAYS HAVE BUILT IN THIS MANNER AND IT SUITS OUR CONSTITUTION A FIDDLE ON YOUR CONSTITUTION HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT AGREES WITH YOUR CONSTITUTION UNLESS YOU TRY YOU OWN YOU ARE NOT WELL
8468-295198-0007 BUT MY HUSBAND PREFERS THIS STYLE OF BUILDING THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE ISN'T PROPERLY INSTRUCTED PRAY DID YOU EVER ATTEND DOCTOR KITE'S LECTURES ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NO I HAVE NO TIME TO ATTEND LECTURES WHO WOULD SIT ON THE EGGS
8468-295198-0008 O MISSUS MAGPIE PRAY DON'T SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND HE WILL THINK I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING NO NO HE WON'T LET ME ALONE I UNDERSTAND JUST HOW TO SAY THE THING I'VE ADVISED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG HUSBANDS IN MY DAY AND I NEVER GAVE OFFENCE
8468-295198-0010 BUT YOU MUST CUT HER I TRY TO ALL I CAN BUT SHE WON'T BE CUT IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIRD SWEAR SAID TOMMY ORIOLE TOMMY ORIOLE TO SAY THE TRUTH HAD AS GOOD A HEART AS EVER BEAT UNDER BIRD'S FEATHERS
8468-295198-0011 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN
8468-295198-0013 WHOSE SUCCESS GRATIFIES HER AMBITION AND PLACES HER IN A DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC POSITION SHE MUST PAY SOMETHING FOR IT I'M SURE BILLY WREN'S WIFE WOULD GIVE HER VERY BILL TO SEE HER HUSBAND IN THE CIRCLES WHERE I AM QUITE AT HOME TO SAY THE TRUTH
8468-295198-0014 MY WIFE WAS ALL WELL ENOUGH CONTENT TILL OLD MOTHER MAGPIE INTERFERED IT IS QUITE MY DUTY TO TAKE STRONG GROUND AND SHOW THAT I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO
8468-295198-0016 LIVED THE OLD MUSIC TEACHER DOCTOR BULLFROG THE POOR OLD DOCTOR WAS A SIMPLE MINDED GOOD AMIABLE CREATURE WHO HAD PLAYED THE DOUBLE BASS AND LED THE FOREST CHOIR ON ALL PUBLIC OCCASIONS SINCE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN
8468-295198-0017 LATTERLY SOME YOUNGSTERS HAD ARISEN WHO SNEERED AT HIS PERFORMANCES AS BEHIND THE AGE IN FACT SINCE A GREAT CITY HAD GROWN UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE FOREST TRIBES OF WANDERING BOYS BROKE UP THE SIMPLE TASTES AND QUIET HABITS
8468-295198-0019 WHEN OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG WAS LEADING A CONCERT HAD DASHED IN AND BROKEN UP THE CHOIR BY THROWING STONES THIS WAS NOT THE WORST OF IT THE LITTLE VARLETS HAD A WAY OF JEERING AT THE SIMPLE OLD DOCTOR AND HIS CONCERTS
8468-295198-0020 THAT OLD BULLFROG WAS A BORE AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET UP A NEW STYLE OF MUSIC IN THE PARISH AND TO GIVE THE CHARGE OF IT TO SOME MORE MODERN PERFORMER
8468-295198-0022 MADAM SAID DOCTOR BULLFROG WITH ALL THAT ENERGY OF TONE FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE I DON'T BELIEVE IT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
8468-295198-0023 NO NO MY GOOD FRIEND I NEVER MAKE MISTAKES WHAT I KNOW I KNOW CERTAINLY
8468-295198-0025 BLESS ME WE SHALL ALL BE RUINED SAID MISSUS BULLFROG MY POOR HUSBAND OH AS TO THAT IF YOU TAKE THINGS IN TIME AND LISTEN TO MY ADVICE SAID MOTHER MAGPIE WE MAY YET PULL YOU THROUGH YOU MUST ALTER YOUR STYLE A LITTLE
8468-295198-0026 ADAPT IT TO MODERN TIMES EVERYBODY NOW IS A LITTLE TOUCHED WITH THE OPERATIC FEVER AND THERE'S TOMMY ORIOLE HAS BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS AND BROUGHT BACK A TOUCH OF THE ARTISTIC IF YOU WOULD TRY HIS STYLE A LITTLE SOMETHING TYROLEAN YOU SEE
8468-295198-0028 I ALWAYS DID TELL YOU THAT YOUR PASSION FOR WATER INJURED YOUR SINGING SUPPOSE TOMMY ORIOLE SHOULD SIT HALF HIS DAYS UP TO HIS HIPS IN WATER AS YOU DO HIS VOICE WOULD BE AS HOARSE AND ROUGH AS YOURS COME UP ON THE BANK AND LEARN TO PERCH AS WE BIRDS DO
8468-295198-0029 WE ARE THE TRUE MUSICAL RACE AND SO POOR MISTER BULLFROG WAS PERSUADED TO FOREGO HIS PLEASANT LITTLE COTTAGE UNDER THE CAT TAILS WHERE HIS GREEN SPECTACLES AND HONEST ROUND BACK HAD EXCITED EVEN IN THE MINDS OF THE BOYS SENTIMENTS OF RESPECT AND COMPASSION
8468-295198-0031 GOT HIMSELF UNIVERSALLY LAUGHED AT FOR APING FASHIONABLE MANNERS EVERY BIRD AND BEAST IN THE FOREST HAD A GIBE AT HIM AND EVEN OLD PARSON TOO WHIT THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO MAKE HIM A PASTORAL CALL
8468-295198-0032 AND ADMONISH HIM ABOUT COURSES UNBEFITTING HIS AGE AND STANDING AS TO MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MAY BE SURE THAT SHE ASSURED EVERY ONE HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT DEAR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG HAD MADE SUCH A FOOL OF HIMSELF
8580-287363-0000 RAPIDLY THE AIRSHIP ASCENDED AND WHEN IT WAS HIGH OVER THE TOWN OF SHOPTON TOM HEADED THE CRAFT DUE WEST LOOKING DOWN HE TRIED TO DESCRY MARY NESTOR IN HER CARRIAGE BUT THE TREES WERE IN THE WAY
8580-287363-0001 THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
8580-287363-0003 CRIED THE ECCENTRIC MISTER DAMON CAN WE VOL PLANE TO EARTH IN THE RED CLOUD TOM YES BUT NOT AS EASILY AS IN THE BUTTERFLY HOWEVER I HOPE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO
8580-287363-0004 NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0006 LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287363-0007 THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
8580-287363-0009 YES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MADE RAD ACT THAT WAY BUT I'LL SET THE AUTOMATIC STEERING GEAR NOW MISTER DAMON AND THEN YOU WILL BE RELIEVED MISTER JENKS WAS GAZING OFF TOWARD THE WEST
8580-287363-0010 TO WHERE HE HOPED TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ASKED TOM IT'S GREAT REPLIED THE DIAMOND MAN I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AIRSHIP BEFORE AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT'S GREAT
8580-287363-0012 GUIDED BY THE AUTOMATIC RUDDERS SO THAT NO ONE WAS NEEDED IN THE PILOT HOUSE SINCE THERE WAS NO DANGER OF COLLISIONS AIRSHIPS ARE NOT QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR THAT YET THOUGH THEY MAY SOON BECOME SO
8580-287363-0013 TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
8580-287363-0015 AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
8580-287363-0016 THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
8580-287363-0018 REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0019 AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
8580-287363-0021 AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
8580-287363-0022 AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
8580-287363-0024 THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0025 AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0027 BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
8580-287363-0028 AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
8580-287363-0030 CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
8580-287363-0031 AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
8580-287363-0033 ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
8580-287363-0034 GASPED MISTER DAMON SOMEWHAT ALARMED BY TOM'S MANNER THE LAD DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HE WAS INTENTLY LISTENING TO A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES THAT CLICKED IN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO HIS LEFT EAR ON HIS FACE
8580-287363-0036 ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
8580-287364-0000 CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003 WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0005 HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006 DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0008 HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009 THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0011 IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012 HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0014 HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015 SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0017 I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018 THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0020 AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024 SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0026 WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS
8580-287364-0027 I THINK I'D LIKE SOME OF THAT CANNED LOBSTER WITH FRENCH DRESSING ON SPOKE THE ECCENTRIC MAN THAT'S AWAY IN THE BACK END OF THE ROOM SAID TOM IN A LOUD VOICE IT'S UNDER A LOT OF BOXES
8580-287364-0029 HE AND TOM MOVED CAUTIOUSLY BACK AMONG THE BOXES AND BARRELS THEY WERE GLANCING ABOUT WITH EAGER EYES TOM SWITCHED ON AN ELECTRIC LIGHT AND THE INSTANT HE DID SO
8580-287364-0030 HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW
8580-287364-0032 LOOK OUT MISTER JENKS CRIED TOM TO WARN THOSE ON GUARD AT THE DOOR OF THE STOREROOM THERE WAS THE REPORT OF A GUN SOME EXCITED SHOUTS AND WHEN TOM COULD SCRAMBLE TO HIS FEET AND RUSH OUT HE BEHELD MISTER PARKER CALMLY SITTING ON A STRUGGLING MAN
8580-287364-0033 WHILE MISTER JENKS HELD A GUN THAT WAS STILL SMOKING WE CAUGHT HIM CRIED THE SCIENTIST ANYBODY HURT ASKED TOM ANXIOUSLY NO I KNOCKED UP HIS GUN AS HE FIRED EXPLAINED MISTER JENKS WHERE ARE THE ROPES TOM
8580-287364-0035 HE WASN'T THERE LONG ENOUGH WELL FARLEY MUNSON SO IT'S YOU IS IT ASKED MISTER JENKS AS HE SURVEYED THE PRISONER DO YOU KNOW HIM ASKED TOM IN SOME SURPRISE
8580-287364-0036 HE WAS IN WITH THE DIAMOND MAKERS SAID MISTER JENKS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE WHO TOOK ME TO THE SECRET CAVE BUT IT WILL BE THE LAST TIME HE EVER GOES THERE HOW HIGH UP ARE WE TOM ABOUT TWO MILES WHY
8580-287364-0038 THROW ME OVER WITH THE AIRSHIP TWO MILES HIGH ARE YOU GASPED THE MAN WILL YOU TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO KNOW IF WE DON'T ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0039 HOW YOU GOT ABOARD AND WHAT YOUR OBJECT WAS IN COMING THAT'S EASY ENOUGH I HAD BEEN HANGING AROUND THE SHED FOR SEVERAL DAYS WATCHING A CHANCE TO GET IN FINALLY I SAW IT WHEN THAT COLORED MAN WENT TO FEED HIS MULE AND I SLIPPED IN AND
8580-287364-0041 DEMANDED MISTER JENKS I WANTED TO PREVENT YOU FROM GOING TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW BY DESTROYING THE AIRSHIP IF NEED BE BUT I HOPED TO ACCOMPLISH IT BY OTHER MEANS
8580-287364-0042 YOU MUST KEEP AWAY FROM THERE AND IF WE REFUSE ASKED TOM THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE WHAT COMES BUT NOT FROM YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER JENKS WE'RE GOING TO GET RID OF YOU
8580-287364-0044 AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
8580-287364-0045 DECLARED THE MAN FIRMLY AND HE WOULD SAY NOTHING MORE THOUGH BY THREATS AND PROMISES MISTER JENKS TRIED TO GET FROM HIM SOMETHING ABOUT THE MEN IN WITH HIM AND WHERE THE CAVE OF THE DIAMONDS WAS LOCATED
8580-287364-0047 WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD ONE THREE DAYS LATER IN CROSSING OVER A LONELY REGION NEAR THE NEBRASKA NATIONAL FOREST FARLEY MUNSON WHICH WAS ONE OF THE NAMES THE SPY WENT BY
8580-287364-0048 WAS DROPPED OFF THE AIRSHIP WHEN IT WAS SENT DOWN TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE EARTH IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET TO A TELEGRAPH OFFICE SAID MISTER JENKS AS A PACKAGE OF FOOD AND A FLASK OF WATER WAS TOSSED DOWN TO THE STOWAWAY

8609-262281-0027 SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
8609-262281-0028 WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
8609-262281-0030 IF THAT ANTICIPATED LIVING WOULD FALL IN WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS AND YOU WERE WHOLLY MINE WE MIGHT HAVE CAROLINE WITH US FOR A TIME LAUGHED MISTER YORKE CONSTANCE LAUGHED TOO DO NOT BE IMPATIENT
8609-262281-0031 OR IT WILL SEEM TO BE FURTHER OFF STILL IT WILL COME WILLIAM THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN AN UNDERTONE STANDING TOGETHER AT A WINDOW APART FROM THE REST MISTER CHANNING WAS LYING ON HIS SOFA UNDERNEATH THE OTHER WINDOW AND NOW SPOKE TO MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0033 I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
8609-262281-0034 BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-262281-0037 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0039 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0040 STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
8609-262281-0042 FRESH HOPE SEEMS TO ARISE DAILY THAT THOSE GERMAN BATHS WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH THEY CURED DOCTOR LAMB I SAY HAMISH THAT THE MONEY MUST BE FOUND FOR IT SOMEHOW ADDED MISTER YORKE FOUND OF COURSE IT SHALL BE FOUND CRIED GAY HAMISH
8609-262281-0043 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
8609-283227-0052 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0055 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0058 AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
8609-283227-0059 DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
8609-283227-0061 ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0064 BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
8609-283227-0065 NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
8609-283227-0067 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0070 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
8629-261139-0000 ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
8629-261139-0002 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
8629-261139-0003 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0006 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
8629-261139-0008 FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
8629-261139-0009 AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
8629-261139-0011 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
8629-261139-0012 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
8629-261139-0014 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
8629-261139-0015 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
8629-261139-0017 THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0020 WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
8629-261139-0021 EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
8629-261139-0023 SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
8629-261139-0024 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
8629-261139-0026 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
8629-261139-0027 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
8629-261139-0029 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
8629-261139-0030 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0033 THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
8629-261139-0035 HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
8629-261139-0036 HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
8629-261139-0038 DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
8629-261139-0039 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
8629-261139-0041 THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
8629-261139-0042 OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
8629-261139-0044 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
8629-261139-0045 YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
8629-261139-0048 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
8629-261139-0050 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
8629-261139-0051 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
8629-261139-0054 BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
8629-261139-0056 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
8629-261139-0057 I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
8629-261139-0059 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
8629-261139-0062 I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
8629-261139-0063 FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
8629-261139-0065 DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
8629-261139-0066 GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
8629-261139-0068 MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
8629-261139-0069 AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
8629-261139-0071 WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
8629-261139-0072 THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
8629-261139-0074 THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
8629-261139-0075 DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
8629-261140-0000 AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
8629-261140-0001 SEEING THIS AND REALISING HIS OPPORTUNITY FREDERICK AT ONCE ENTERED INTO THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHICH EACH HEART THERE PANTED THIS WILL BE OVERWHELMING NEWS TO HIM WHO HAS CARED FOR ME SINCE INFANCY
8629-261140-0003 OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
8629-261140-0004 THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
8629-261140-0006 THE LOVE THE PASSION
8629-261140-0007 TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
8629-261140-0009 IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
8629-261140-0010 AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
8629-261140-0012 SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
8629-261140-0013 AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
8629-261140-0015 AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
8629-261140-0016 SHE POINTED TO THE DAGGER IN HER BREAST BUT BEFORE I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON IT SHE CALLED FOR BATSY I WANT HER TO HEAR ME DECLARE BEFORE I GO SAID SHE THAT THIS STROKE WAS DELIVERED BY MYSELF UPON MYSELF
8629-261140-0018 IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
8629-261140-0019 FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
8629-261140-0021 AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
8629-261140-0022 JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
8629-261140-0024 AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
8629-261140-0025 AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
8629-261140-0027 BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
8629-261140-0028 AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
8629-261140-0030 AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
8629-261140-0031 I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
8629-261140-0033 IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
8629-261140-0034 WAS NEITHER OF HER BLOOD NOR HIS ROSE UP BETWEEN US AND CAUSED ME NOT ONLY TO ATTEMPT SILENCE BUT TO SECRETE IN THE ADJOINING WOODS THE MONEY I HAD RECEIVED IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT ALL VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MOTHER'S TRAGIC DEATH
8629-261140-0036 STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
8629-261140-0037 AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
8629-261140-0039 THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
8629-261140-0040 WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
8629-261140-0042 THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
8629-261140-0043 SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
8629-261140-0045 YET HOW THRILLING IT HAD BEEN TO HEAR HIM PLEAD HIS CAUSE SO WELL IT WAS ALMOST WORTH THE LOSS OF HER REVENGE TO MEET HIS LOOK OF HATE AND DREAM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING IT LATER INTO THE OLD LOOK OF LOVE YES YES SHE LOVED HIM NOW
8629-261140-0046 NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
8629-261140-0048 HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
8629-261140-0049 SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
8630-305212-0000 CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
8630-305212-0001 HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
8630-305212-0003 AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE WORSE THAN HE REALLY WAS LEST HIS PRESTIGE SHOULD SUFFER IN THEIR EYES THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE LOATHED IT ALL AND LONGED FOR THE OLD LIFE WITH ITS INNOCENT PLEASURES
8630-305212-0004 BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0006 OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
8630-305212-0007 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0009 BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0010 THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0012 SHE HAD USED TO BE VIOLENT AND HEADSTRONG LIKE HIMSELF RESENTFUL AND IMPLACABLE IN HER DISLIKES BUT NOW SHE WAS MORE LIKE MONICA THAN LIKE HIM THAT WAS MONICA'S WAY THOUGH HER SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE
8630-305212-0013 SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0015 THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0018 PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0019 HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD COST A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ROMANIANUS
8630-305212-0021 SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022 TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0024 IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED
8630-305212-0025 THE BLOODY COMBATS BETWEEN MEN AND BEASTS THE GLADIATORIAL SHOWS THAT DELIGHTED THE ROMANS WERE FREE TO ALL WHO CHOSE TO FREQUENT THE AMPHITHEATRE OF CARTHAGE SUCH PLAYS AS THE ROMANS DELIGHTED IN
8630-305212-0027 THE WEALTHIER STUDENTS GLORIED IN THEIR BAD REPUTATION THEY WERE YOUNG MEN OF FASHION WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING AND WHO WERE CAREFUL TO LET OTHERS KNOW IT THEY WENT BY THE NAME OF SMASHERS OR UPSETTERS
8630-305212-0028 FROM THEIR HABIT OF RAIDING THE SCHOOLS OF PROFESSORS WHOSE TEACHING THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND BREAKING EVERYTHING ON WHICH THEY COULD LAY HANDS THEY TREATED NEW COMERS WITH COARSE BRUTALITY BUT AUGUSTINE SEEMS IN SOME MANNER
8630-305212-0030 AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY
8630-305212-0031 MY GOD HE CRIED IN LATER YEARS WITH WHAT BITTER GALL DIDST THOU IN THY GREAT MERCY SPRINKLE THOSE PLEASURES OF MINE HE COULD NOT FORGET
8630-305212-0033 EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
8630-305212-0034 THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
8630-305212-0036 THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH
8630-305212-0037 AND TO BE WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR EVERLASTING HOME BUT MONICA'S HAPPINESS WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED FOR IT SEEMED THAT PATRICIUS WOULD SOON REJOIN HIS MOTHER
8630-305212-0039 WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND TRUSTFULNESS OF A CHILD HE LOOKED TO HER FOR GUIDANCE AND DID ALL THAT SHE DESIRED THE CEREMONY OVER HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SMILED
8630-305212-0040 A WONDERFUL PEACE POSSESSED HIM THE OLD LIFE WITH ALL ITS STAINS HAD PASSED FROM HIM IN THOSE CLEANSING WATERS THE NEW LIFE WAS AT HAND ONCE MORE HE ASKED HER
8630-305212-0042 SHE HAD BEEN HIS ANGEL HE SAID HE OWED ALL HIS JOY TO HER IT WAS HER LOVE HER PATIENCE THAT HAD DONE IT ALL SHE HAD SHOWN HIM THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS AND MADE HIM LOVE IT
8630-305212-0043 HE THANKED HER FOR ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD SHOWN HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM HER TEARS FELL ON HIS FACE HER LOVING ARMS SUPPORTED HIM HER SWEET VOICE BROKEN WITH WEEPING
8630-305213-0000 CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
8630-305213-0001 SHE NEEDED LITTLE IT IS TRUE FOR HERSELF BUT THERE WAS AUGUSTINE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE PRACTISED THE STRICTEST ECONOMY TO KEEP HIM AT CARTHAGE WHERE HE WAS DOING SO WELL
8630-305213-0003 THIS WOULD SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LODGING FOR THE REST CONTINUED ROMANIANUS AS AN OLD FRIEND OF PATRICIUS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BEFRIEND HIS SON AND MONICA MUST GRANT HIM THE PRIVILEGE
8630-305213-0004 OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
8630-305213-0006 YOU IT WAS ROMANIANUS WROTE AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS WHO WHEN I WAS A POOR YOUNG STUDENT IN CARTHAGE OPENED TO ME YOUR HOUSE YOUR PURSE AND STILL MORE YOUR HEART
8630-305213-0007 YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
8630-305213-0009 AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
8630-305213-0010 THEY WERE SMALL AS YET BUILT ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE FAITHFUL AND HELD BUT FEW PATIENTS THESE DEVOTED WOMEN SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT INTERVALS
8630-305213-0012 THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
8630-305213-0013 IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0015 WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0016 THERE WERE THE POOR TO BE HELPED THE HUNGRY TO BE FED THE NAKED TO BE CLOTHED SHE WOULD GATHER THE ORPHAN CHILDREN AT HER KNEE TO TEACH THEM THE TRUTHS OF THEIR FAITH WHEN THEY WERE VERY POOR
8630-305213-0018 IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019 WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
8630-305213-0021 BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
8630-305213-0022 EVERY MORNING FOUND HER IN HER PLACE IN CHURCH FOR THE HOLY SACRIFICE EVERY EVENING SHE WAS THERE AGAIN SILENT ABSORBED IN GOD THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNELT WAS OFTEN WET WITH HER TEARS
8630-305213-0024 AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
8630-305213-0025 HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
8630-305213-0027 HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0028 MONICA POURED OUT HER TEARS AND HER SORROW WITH OTHERS SHE WAS SERENE AND HOPEFUL AS OF OLD EVEN JOYOUS ALWAYS READY TO HELP AND COMFORT IT WAS SAID OF HER AFTER HER DEATH
8630-305213-0030 OF MAKING THEM WISH TO BE BETTER AUGUSTINE MEANWHILE AT CARTHAGE WAS JUSTIFYING ALL THE HOPES THAT HAD BEEN FORMED OF HIM HE HAD EVEN GREATER GIFTS IT SEEMED THAN ELOQUENCE FEELING AND WIT
8630-305213-0031 HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS IN RHETORIC HIS MASTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF A CERTAIN TREATISE OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE WOULD SOON BE CALLED UPON TO STUDY IT WAS SO PROFOUND HE SAID THAT FEW COULD UNDERSTAND IT
8630-305213-0033 TO ASK A SINGLE EXPLANATION IT WAS THE SAME WITH GEOMETRY MUSIC EVERY SCIENCE HE TOOK UP THIS YOUNG GENIUS OF NINETEEN ONLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
8630-305213-0034 WHEN HE HAD TO TEACH OTHERS AND REALIZED HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE ABOUT AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0036 THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
8630-305213-0037 THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
8630-305213-0039 PAGAN THOUGH HE WAS HAD AWAKENED A THIRST FOR WISDOM IN THE YOUNG STUDENT'S SOUL ALREADY HE FELT THE EMPTINESS OF EARTHLY JOYS I LONGED MY GOD HE WRITES
8630-305213-0040 AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
8630-305213-0042 COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
8630-305213-0043 DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
8630-305213-0045 THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
8630-305213-0046 TO IMPOSE ON CHRISTIANS THEY USED CHRISTIAN WORDS FOR DOCTRINES THAT WERE THOROUGHLY UNCHRISTIAN PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HATRED OF THE CHURCH AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0048 NAMELY THAT THEY PROFESSED TO FREE US FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING US TO GOD BY PURE REASON ALONE WITHOUT THAT TERRIBLE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY FOR WHAT ELSE INDUCED ME TO ABANDON THE FAITH OF MY CHILDHOOD
8630-305213-0049 AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
8630-305213-0051 THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
8630-305213-0052 THEY TAUGHT WHAT WAS FALSE NOT ONLY ABOUT THEE MY GOD WHO ART THE VERY TRUTH BUT EVEN ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD THY CREATURES SO MUCH FOR THEIR DOCTRINES AS FOR THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
8630-305213-0054 WHO COULD NOT FIND THE STRENGTH TO BREAK WITH HIS BAD HABITS SUCH WAS MY MIND HE SUMS UP LATER LOOKING BACK ON THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE SO WEIGHED DOWN SO BLINDED BY THE FLESH
8747-293952-0000 THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0002 BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003 SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0005 THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006 MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0008 SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009 AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0011 AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012 A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0014 I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015 IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0017 I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018 POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0020 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021 BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0023 IN SCHOOLBOY PHRASE A SNEAK I AM JUST GOING MISTER BERYL ARE YOU ILL LUCY ASKED BERYL WITH AFFECTION I HAVE AN ATTACK OF NERVES SHE REPLIED PETTISHLY
8747-293952-0024 POOR BERNARD'S DEATH HAS SHAKEN ME IT IS JUST AS WELL HE DID DIE THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SAID PAYNE BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN MISS RANDOLPH AND REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0026 WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027 SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0029 WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030 ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0032 NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033 LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0035 MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0038 YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE
8747-293952-0039 I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
8747-293952-0041 THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
8747-293952-0042 HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
8747-293952-0044 LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
8747-293952-0045 MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048 HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0050 LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051 I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0053 THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054 AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0056 AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
8747-293952-0057 HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0059 FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060 I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0062 YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063 A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0065 AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066 ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM
8747-293952-0068 JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069 WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0071 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072 FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0074 HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0077 WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078 BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0080 JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081 JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0083 IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0086 I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0089 AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090 LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0092 HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
8747-293952-0093 A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
8747-293952-0095 I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER AT COVE CASTLE THAT'S LORD CONNISTON'S PLACE SAID MISS BERENGARIA MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER MY NAME IS JERRY MOON
8747-293952-0096 HIS LORDSHIP GOT ME A SITUATION AT A TOBACCONIST'S SAID THE CHILD LIKE MOON AND THEN HE GOT ME TURNED OFF WHY THAT IS NOT LIKE LORD CONNISTON
8747-293952-0098 I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
8747-293952-0099 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID MISS BERENGARIA ANGRILY YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL WHAT LORD CONNISTON WISHED KEPT SECRET IT WAS ONLY A FREAK ON HIS PART HE LEFT THE ARMY AT MY REQUEST
8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY
8747-293952-0102 YES SWEET LADY DON'T TALK LIKE THAT CHILD CALL ME MA'AM
8747-293952-0104 I CAN VOUCH FOR HIS HONESTY HE SAID BUT HE TALKS TOO MUCH HE MUST HOLD HIS TONGUE HERE SAID THE OLD DAME SEVERELY AND SHAKING HER TROWEL AT THE BOY WHERE ARE HIS CLOTHES I HAVE NONE BUT WHAT'S ON CRIED JERRY
8747-293952-0105 THE KIND GENTLEMAN GOT THEM FOR ME MA'AM YOU ARE A BETTER CHRISTIAN THAN I THOUGHT SAID MISS BERENGARIA LOOKING AT BERYL WELL YOU CAN STAY HERE BOY GO TO THE KITCHEN AND TELL THE SERVANTS TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
8747-293952-0107 I NEVER DID HAVING BEEN TO SUNDAY SCHOOL YES MA'AM I'M GOING AND JERRY IN ANSWER TO AN IMPERATIVE WAVE OF HIS NEW MISTRESS'S HAND DISAPPEARED MISS BERENGARIA TURNED TO BERYL
8747-293952-0108 I MUST SEE THAT HE DOESN'T SWEAR OR SMOKE OR INDULGE IN ANY OF THOSE WICKED THINGS I HOPE HE WILL DO YOUR RECOMMENDATION CREDIT MISTER BERYL I HOPE HE WILL SAID JULIUS AND FELT A STRONG INCLINATION
8770-295462-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
8770-295462-0001 WHEN HE SAW THE OTHER BOYS HURTING A MUD TURTLE IN HIS FIRST SCHOOL COMPOSITION ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HIS STEPSISTER REMEMBERS THIS SENTENCE AN ANT'S LIFE IS AS SWEET TO IT
8770-295462-0003 NOT ONLY FROM MUD AND COLD BUT ALSO FROM A DRUNKARD'S GRAVE FOR THAT TALL LAD'S LOVE AND MERCY REVEALED TO THE POOR CREATURE THE TERRIBLE SLAVERY OF WHICH HE WAS THE VICTIM
8770-295462-0004 HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
8770-295462-0006 STILL MIGHTIEST IN MORAL REFORMATION ON THAT NAME NO EULOGY IS EXPECTED IT CANNOT BE TO ADD TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN OR GLORY TO THE NAME OF WASHINGTON IS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE
8770-295462-0007 WHICH DID SO MUCH TO BRING ABOUT IN TIME A DOUBLE EMANCIPATION FROM WHITE SLAVERY AND BLACK ONCE AS PRESIDENT HE SAID TO A BOY WHO HAD JUST SIGNED THE TEMPERANCE PLEDGE NOW SONNY
8770-295462-0009 AND LITTLE TAD TO VISIT GENERAL GRANT AT HIS HEADQUARTERS AT CITY POINT VIRGINIA WHEN ASKED HOW HE WAS DURING THE RECEPTION WHICH FOLLOWED HIS ARRIVAL THERE THE PRESIDENT SAID AS RELATED BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER
8770-295462-0010 THAT'S THE BEST REMEDY I KNOW OF FOR SEA SICKNESS NO NO MY YOUNG FRIEND REPLIED THE PRESIDENT I'VE SEEN MANY A MAN IN MY TIME SEASICK ASHORE FROM DRINKING THAT VERY ARTICLE
8770-295462-0012 THE MORE THEY NEEDED HIS SYMPATHETIC HELP THE MORE CERTAIN THEY WERE TO RECEIVE IT MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE UNDER DOG SAID MISTER LINCOLN ONE DAY THOUGH IT IS OFTEN THAT DOG THAT STARTS THE FUSS
8770-295462-0013 DID NOT MAKE HIM FORFEIT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SYMPATHY THAT WAS ONLY A GOOD LESSON TO HIM TO LOOK OUT AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME THE QUESTION OF EMANCIPATION
8770-295462-0015 THE EXTREME ABOLITIONISTS WHO WISHED SLAVERY ABOLISHED WHETHER OR NO SENT MEN TO TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT IF HE DID NOT FREE THE SLAVES HE WAS A COWARD AND A TURNCOAT
8770-295462-0016 AND THEY WOULD WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY DELEGATIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS FROM ALL OVER THE NORTH ARRIVED ALMOST DAILY FROM DIFFERENT CITIES TO URGE COAX AND THREATEN THE PRESIDENT
8770-295462-0018 IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
8770-295462-0019 COMPELS ME TO SAY TO YOU IN REPLY THAT IT IS A MESSAGE FROM OUR DIVINE MASTER THROUGH ME COMMANDING YOU SIR TO OPEN THE DOORS OF BONDAGE
8770-295462-0021 DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RATHER ODD THAT HE SHOULD SEND SUCH A MESSAGE BY WAY OF THAT AWFUL WICKED CITY OF CHICAGO THE MINISTERS WERE SHOCKED AT SUCH AN ANSWER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295462-0022 THEY COULD NOT KNOW FOR MISTER LINCOLN DARED NOT TELL THEM THAT HE HAD THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN HIS POCKET WAITING FOR A FEDERAL VICTORY BEFORE HE COULD ISSUE IT THE PROCLAMATION
8770-295462-0024 THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT HELD A MEETING OF HIS CABINET FOR SOME TIME HE THOUGHT OF THE OCCASION WHEN AS A YOUNG MAN HE WENT ON A FLATBOAT TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND SAW
8770-295462-0025 I'LL HIT IT HARD NOW THE CHANCE TO HIT THAT THING THE INHUMAN MONSTER OF HUMAN SLAVERY HAD COME AND HE WAS GOING TO HIT IT HARD HE CALLED THE CABINET TOGETHER
8770-295462-0027 I WENT IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND THE HISTORIC WAR CABINET OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSEMBLED EVERY MEMBER BEING PRESENT THE PRESIDENT HARDLY NOTICED ME AS I CAME IN
8770-295462-0028 LET ME READ YOU A CHAPTER THAT IS VERY FUNNY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET SMILED AS FOR MYSELF I WAS ANGRY AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BUFFOONERY
8770-295462-0030 WELL HE SAID LET'S HAVE ANOTHER CHAPTER I WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER I SHOULD RISE AND LEAVE THE MEETING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE THREW THE BOOK DOWN HEAVED A LONG SIGH AND SAID
8770-295462-0031 GENTLEMEN WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH WITH THE FEARFUL STRAIN THAT IS UPON ME NIGHT AND DAY IF I DID NOT LAUGH I SHOULD DIE AND YOU NEED THIS MEDICINE AS MUCH AS I DO
8770-295462-0033 IT IS DUE TO MY CABINET THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND KNOW OF IT AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE AS TO THE FORM OF THIS PAPER OR ITS COMPOSITION I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR THEM
8770-295462-0034 WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
8770-295462-0036 AND THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE CANONIZED HENCEFORTH I SEE THE LIGHT AND THE COUNTRY IS SAVED AND ALL SAID AMEN AND LINCOLN SAID TO ME IN A DROLL WAY JUST AS I WAS LEAVING
8770-295462-0037 THAT DECLARATION YOUNG ABE LINCOLN FIRST READ IN THE GENTRYVILLE CONSTABLE'S COPY OF THE STATUTES OF INDIANA AT NOON ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
8770-295462-0039 MISTER LINCOLN SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE TOOK UP THE PEN DIPPED IT IN THE INK HELD THE PEN A MOMENT THEN LAID IT DOWN AFTER WAITING A WHILE HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
8770-295462-0040 TURNING TO HIS SECRETARY OF STATE HE SAID TO EXPLAIN HIS HESITATION
8770-295463-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG THE BATTLE
8770-295463-0001 IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0003 THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0004 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
8770-295463-0006 WAS THE DARKEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT LINCOLN WALKED THE FLOOR THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG CRYING OUT IN HIS ANGUISH O WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY
8770-295463-0007 AFTER WINNING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WHICH THE PRESIDENT HOPED WOULD END THE WAR GENERAL MEADE INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY STATED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN THE INVADERS FROM OUR SOIL
8770-295463-0009 THE STRONGHOLD OF THE GREAT WEST
8770-295463-0010 CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0012 THAT IF HE WOULD STAND BY OUR BOYS AT GETTYSBURG I WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE DID AND I WILL THE PRESIDENT'S CALL ON GENERAL SICKLES WAS ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE THREE DAYS BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0013 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUNBOAT AT CAIRO ILLINOIS WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS FROM VICKSBURG WHICH ADDED NEW LUSTER TO THE PATRIOTIC JOY OF INDEPENDENCE DAY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES
8770-295463-0015 I HAVE BEEN PRAYING OVER VICKSBURG ALSO AND BELIEVE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE US VICTORY THERE TOO BECAUSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BISECT THE CONFEDERACY
8770-295463-0016 PROMINENT IN NATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS AND THE GREATEST LIVING ORATOR WAS INVITED TO DELIVER THE GRAND ORATION THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE COULD TO COME AND MAKE A FEW DEDICATORY REMARKS
8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295463-0019 WHEN MISTER BROOKS ASKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH FOR THAT OCCASION MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN BUT NOT LICKED INTO SHAPE YET IT'S SHORT SHORT SHORT
8770-295463-0021 DON'T HURRY BOYS THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING GOING ON TILL I GET THERE WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG A LITTLE GIRL ON THE PLATFORM HELD UP A BOUQUET TO MISTER LINCOLN LISPING FLOWERTH FOR THE PRETHIDENT
8770-295463-0022 HE REACHED OUT TOOK HER UP AND KISSED HER SAYING YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE ROSEBUD YOURSELF I HOPE YOUR LIFE WILL OPEN INTO PERPETUAL BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
8770-295463-0024 THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING
8770-295463-0025 WATCHING HER WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FANNING HER TENDERLY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHE GASPED I FEEL BETTER NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY HUSBAND
8770-295463-0027 WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ATTEND TAKING SECRETARY SEWARD WITH HIM HE CALLED ON AN OLD COBBLER NAMED JOHN BURNS OF WHOSE COURAGE IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG MISTER LINCOLN HAD JUST HEARD
8770-295465-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0002 WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
8770-295465-0003 AND IT WAS HIS ONLY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GREATEST PLEASURE HIS BOYISH HEART WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT WAS THE SWEETEST WORD EVER HEARD BY THE WAR BURDENED CRUSHED AND SORROWING SOUL OF THE BROKEN HEARTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295465-0005 BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0008 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0012 BEGAN IN THE LOG CABIN WHEN HE HAD NO IDEA HE COULD EVER BE EXERCISING HIS LOVING KINDNESS IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION THE HOME OF THE NATION WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE
8770-295465-0014 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0015 HE MET IN THE GRAY UNIFORM BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW HIS TENDERNESS TO THE SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS A SECRET PIGEONHOLE IN HIS DESK STUFFED FULL OF THREATS OF ASSASSINATION HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH
8770-295465-0017 ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS VERY LIFE IF IT COULD SAVE OR HELP OTHERS ALL THESE THINGS LITTLE TAD COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0020 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0023 WE MEET THIS EVENING NOT IN SORROW BUT GLADNESS OF HEART THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURGENT ARMY AT APPOMATTOX GIVE HOPE OF A RIGHTEOUS AND SPEEDY PEACE
8770-295465-0024 AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
8770-295465-0026 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0029 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0033 WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
8770-295465-0035 HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
8770-295465-0036 TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
8770-295465-0038 GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE THE FOND HEARTED LITTLE FELLOW WENT ABROAD WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT BROKE BOTH THEIR LIVES BY A SURGICAL OPERATION AND BY STRUGGLING MANFULLY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
8797-294123-0021 CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
8797-294123-0022 AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
8797-294123-0024 I DINED AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT CLEANSED MYSELF AT A PUBLIC BATH IN A PRIVATE TUB WITH A SMALL BOY TO ASSIST IN THE SCRUBBING I BOUGHT CONDENSED MILK BITTER CANNED VEGETABLES BREAD AND CAKE I REPEAT IT CAKE GOOD CAKE
8797-294123-0025 I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0033 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR

8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN

8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0034 AND NOW I MUST REALLY BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN THEIR SERIOUS BUSINESS LIKE WAY THAT'S EASY DONE MISTER MONTGOMERY SAID THE FAT VOICED PUBLICAN BUT BEFORE SAYIN ANYTHING WE HAD TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER
8838-298545-0035 FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
8838-298546-0042 THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
8838-298546-0045 SHE FAIR SCRATTED THE FACE OFF A POTMAN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM A GALLON FROM T CHEQUERS THEY SAY THE HUSSY IS HIS SPARRIN PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SWEETHEART AND THAT HIS POOR WIFE IS JUST BREAKIN HER HEART OVER IT HULLO YOUNG UN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
8838-298546-0048 I WANTED TO TELL YOUR MON SOMETHIN ABOOT T MAISTER WE'VE NO TIME TO LISTEN TO GOSSIP MY BOY WE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE MASTER BUT THOU DOAN'T SIR NOBODY KNOWS BUT ME AND MOTHER AND WE THOUGHT AS WE'D LIKE THY MON TO KNOW SIR

8975-270782-0000 THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0001 TRANSFORMS THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER FORM OF EXPRESSION THE LATENT THOUGHTS ARE NO OTHER THAN THE CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS KNOWN TO US IN OUR WAKING HOURS THE NEW MODE OF EXPRESSION IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US BECAUSE OF ITS MANY SIDED FEATURES
8975-270782-0003 BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
8975-270782-0004 THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
8975-270782-0006 HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ARCHAIC CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES THE PECULIAR AMNESIA THAT IS LOSS OF MEMORY CONCERNING CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST YEARS TO THE FIFTH
8975-270782-0007 THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
8975-270782-0009 NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
8975-270782-0010 I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
8975-270782-0012 THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
8975-270782-0013 HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
8975-270782-0015 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0018 HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
8975-270782-0019 AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
8975-270782-0021 WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
8975-270782-0022 IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
8975-270782-0024 THE WOMAN WHOSE DREAM IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DEAD DISCOVERS UNDER OUR GUIDANCE THAT SHE IN FACT AT ONE TIME ENTERTAINED THIS WISH
8975-270782-0025 WHICH EARLY ENDED IN A SEPARATION
8975-270782-0027 INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
8975-270782-0028 THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
8975-270782-0030 ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
8975-270782-0031 THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
8975-270782-0033 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
8975-270782-0034 THAT THIS OUTLIVED WISH CAN BE SHOWN TO ACT AS A DREAM STIMULATOR AND LET US CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EVIL WISHES ADMIT OF THE SAME DERIVATION OUT OF THE PAST LET US CONTINUE WITH THE REMOVAL OR DEATH WISH
8975-270782-0036 AS OFTEN AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN OUR WAY IN LIFE AND HOW OFTEN MUST THIS HAPPEN IN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS OF LIFE THE DREAM IS READY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM BE HE FATHER MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SPOUSE ET CETERA
8975-270782-0037 WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
8975-270782-0039 EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
8975-270782-0040 NOT UNTIL LATER DOES THE LOVE IMPULSE BECOME INDEPENDENT OF EGOISM IN BRIEF EGOISM HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD TO LOVE IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE THE CHILD'S REGARD
8975-270782-0042 OFTEN ENOUGH THIS ATTITUDE IS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE TENDER FEELING OR RATHER LET US SAY GLOSSED OVER BUT THE HOSTILE FEELING APPEARS REGULARLY TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIER IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN CHILDREN OF FROM TWO AND ONE HALF
8975-270782-0043 TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
8975-270782-0045 IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS LESS THE CHILD LEARNS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVAL WITH INTENSE PSYCHIC ACTIVITY AND ACCOMMODATES HIMSELF TO THE NEW SITUATION IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS GREATER THE NEW CHILD MAY AWAKEN CERTAIN SYMPATHIES AS AN
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0048 THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0049 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0054 AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
8975-270782-0055 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0057 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0060 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0063 BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
8975-270782-0064 H SACHS BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS DREAM WISH IN PLACES WHERE IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH LIFE AND WHERE THE ADULT IN HIS WAKING HOURS WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE IT THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE DEEPEST AND MOST UNIFORM MOTIVE FOR BECOMING UNFRIENDLY
8975-270782-0066 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0069 BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
8975-270782-0070 CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0073 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0075 WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
8975-270782-0076 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0081 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0082 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
8975-270782-0084 POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
8975-270782-0085 AND TO DISGUISE ANOTHER PART BY MISREPRESENTING ITS SEXUAL NATURE UNTIL THEY CAN DENY THE WHOLE BUSINESS THESE ARE OFTEN THE SAME PERSONS WHO DISCOURSE VIOLENTLY AGAINST ALL THE SEXUAL FAULTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0087 OF PERVERSE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO BE SURE THE GROWN UPS ARE RIGHT IN LOOKING UPON THESE THINGS AS CHILDISH PERFORMANCES AS PLAY FOR THE CHILD IS NOT TO BE JUDGED AS MATURE AND ANSWERABLE EITHER BEFORE THE BAR OF CUSTOM OR BEFORE THE LAW
8975-270782-0088 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0090 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0093 AND MOST CUSTOMARY CHOICE AND THAT NOT UNTIL LATER IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE THE SOURCE OF WHICH PROBABLY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY
8975-270782-0094 TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREAM WE FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THE MATERIALS OF FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DREAM
8975-270782-0096 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0099 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0102 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0105 UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
8975-270782-0106 BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0108 THE DAY REMNANTS COMBINES IN THE DREAM FABRICATION
8975-270782-0109 BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
8975-270782-0111 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0112 WHY DO NOT THE SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULI DO THE JOB WITHOUT IT AND IF THEY MUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP DISGUISE THEMSELVES THROUGH OLD FORMS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE NO LONGER COMPREHENSIBLE
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
